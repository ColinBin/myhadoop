 a great grief 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story really consists of two parts the first part might be left out but it gives us a few particulars and these are useful we were staying in the country at a seat where it happened that the master was absent for a few days in the meantime there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her and came she said to dispose of shares in her she had her papers with her and we advised her to put them in an envelope and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the knight c 
 she listened to us attentively seized the pen paused and begged us to repeat the direction slowly we complied and she wrote but in the midst of the general war she struck fast sighed deeply and said i am only a woman her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor his outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back 
 he bite said the lady he has no teeth he is like one of the family faithful and grumpy but the latter is my fault for they have teased him they play at wedding and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid and too much for him poor old fellow and she delivered her papers and took puggie upon her arm and this is the first part of the story which might have been left out 
 puggie died the second part it was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town and put up at the inn our windows looked into the which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks in one half were many skins and hides raw and tanned here was all the apparatus necessary to carry on a tannery and it belonged to the widow puggie had died in the morning and was to be buried in this part of the yard the grandchildren of the widow that is of the widow for puggie had never been married filled up the grave and it was a beautiful grave it must have been quite pleasant to lie there the grave was bordered with pieces of and strewn over with sand quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle with the neck upwards and that was not at all allegorical 
 the children danced round the grave and the eldest of the boys among them a practical youngster of seven years made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of for all who lived in the lane the price of admission was to be a trouser button for every boy would be sure to have one and each might also give one for a little girl this proposal was adopted by acclamation 
 and all the children out of the lane yes even out of the little lane at the back flocked to the place and each gave a button 
 many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one suspender but then they had seen grave and the sight was worth much more 
 but in front of the close to the entrance stood a little girl clothed in rags very pretty to look at with curly hair and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them the child said not a word nor did she cry but each time the little door was opened she gave a long long look into the yard she had not a button that she knew right well and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away then she sat down held her little brown hands before her eyes and burst into tears this girl alone had not seen grave it was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience 
 we saw this from above and looked at from above how many a grief of our own and of others can make us smile that is the story and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the from the window

 of unity in religion 
 religion being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is 
 well contained within the true band of unity the quarrels and divisions about 
 religion were evils unknown to the heathen the reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief 
 for you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets but the true god haul this attribute that he is a jealous god and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what means 
 the fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of god which is all in all are 
 two me one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within for the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals yea more than corruption of manners for as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humour so in the spiritual so that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach of unity and therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith ecce in deserto another saith ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in ears nolite exire go not out the doctor of the gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad and certainly it is lime better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners it is but a light thing to be vouched in so serious a matter but yet it expressed well the deformity 
 there is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book the moms dance of heretics for indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things as for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containe infinite blessings it establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience and it turneth the labours of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion 
 concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly 
 there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrement between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our saviour himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention 
 this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of me point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife 
 about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers 
 coat indeed had no seam but the vesture was of divers colours whereupon he saith in veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an subtlety and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious then substantial 
 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrement between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our saviour himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention 
 this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of me point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife 
 about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers 
 coat indeed had no seam but the vesture was of divers colours whereupon he saith in veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an subtlety and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious then substantial 
 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 m myriel becomes m welcome 
 the episcopal palace of d adjoins the hospital 
 the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abbe of simore who had been bishop of d in 
 this palace was a genuine seignorial residence everything about it had a grand apartments of the bishop the the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees in the a long and superb gallery which was situated on the and opened on the gardens m henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles brulart de genlis archbishop prince antoine de mesgrigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore de lerins francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar de sabran de forcalquier bishop seignor of glandeve and jean soanen priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishop seignor of senez the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the th of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble 
 the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden 
 three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house 
 monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment 
 monseigneur 
 that was the number which i counted said the bishop 
 the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other 
 that is what i observed 
 the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them 
 so it seems to me 
 and then when there is a ray of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents 
 that was what i said to myself 
 in case of have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at know not what to do 
 that is the thought which occurred to me 
 what would you have monseigneur said the director 
 one must resign self 
 this conversation took place in the gallery on the 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital 
 monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold 
 exclaimed the stupefied director 
 the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes 
 it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself 
 then raising his voice 
 hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something there is evidently a mistake here 
 there are of you in five or six small rooms 
 there are three of us here and we have room for sixty 
 there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours 
 give me back my house you are at home here 
 on the following day the patients were installed in the palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital 
 m myriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution 
 his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage 
 m myriel received from the state in his quality of bishop a salary of fifteen thousand francs 
 on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner we transcribe here a note made by his own hand 
 note on the regulation of my household expenses 
 for the little seminary livres 
 society of the mission 
 for the lazarists of montdidier 
 seminary for foreign missions in paris 
 congregation of the holy spirit 
 religious establishments of the holy land 
 charitable maternity societies 
 extra for that of arles 
 work for the amelioration of prisons 
 work for the relief and delivery of prisoners 
 to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 
 addition to the salary of the poor teachers of thediocese 
 public granary of the 
 congregation of the ladies of d of manosque and of sisteron for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls 
 for the poor 
 my personal expenses 
 total 
 m myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses 
 this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine 
 this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church she simply loved and venerated him 
 when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence 
 their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little 
 it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine made fifteen hundred francs a year 
 on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted 
 and when a village curate came to d the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine 
 one day after he had been in d about three months the bishop said 
 and still i am quite cramped with it all 
 i should think so exclaimed madame magloire 
 monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese 
 it was customary for bishops in former days 
 hold cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire 
 and he made his demand 
 some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading 
 allowance to m the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits 
 this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d wrote to m bigot de preameneu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines 
 expenses of carriage 
 what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants 
 expenses of journeys 
 what is the use of these trips in the first place 
 next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts 
 there are no roads no one travels otherwise than on horseback 
 even the bridge between durance and can barely support these priests are all thus greedy and avaricious 
 this man played the good priest when he first came 
 now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days 
 oh all this priesthood things will not go well m le comte until the emperor has freed us from these rascals 
 down with the pope 
 matters were getting embroiled with rome for my part i am for caesar alone etc etc 
 on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire good said she to mademoiselle baptistine monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all he has regulated all his charities 
 now here are three thousand francs for us 
 at last 
 that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms 
 expenses of carriage and circuit 
 for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital livres 
 for the maternity charitable society of aix 
 for the maternity charitable society of draguignan 
 for foundlings 
 for orphans 
 total 
 such was m budget 
 as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage bans dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy 
 after a time offerings of money flowed in 
 those who had and those who lacked knocked at m latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit 
 in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress 
 considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities 
 far from it 
 as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received 
 it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any 
 then he stripped himself 
 the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters the poor people of the had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenomens of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him 
 moreover this appellation pleased him 
 i like that name said he 
 bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur 
 we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original

 a new hope 
 ii 
 
 it was an old saying that you could burn your eyes out faster by staringstraight and hard at the flatlands of tatooine than by looking directly atits two huge suns themselves so powerful was the penetrating glare reflected fromthose endless wastes despite the flare life could and did exist in the flatlandsformed by seabeds one thing made it possible the reintroductionof water 
 for human purposes however the water of tatooine was only marginallyaccessible the atmosphere yielded its moisture with reluctance it had to becoaxed down out of the hard blue forced yanked down to the parchedsurface two figures whose concern was obtaining that moisture were standing on aslight rise of one of those inhospitable flats one of the pair was stiff and vaporator sunk securely through sand and into deeper rock the figurenext to it was a food deal more animated though no less 
 luke skywalker was twice the age of the vaporator but much lesssecure at the moment he was swearing softly at a recalcitrant valve adjuster on thetemperamental device from time to time he resorted to some unsubtle pounding inplace of using the appropriate tool neither method worked very well luke wassure that the lubricants used on the vaporator went out of their way to attract seductively to small abrasive particles with an oily gleam he wipedsweat from his forehead and leaned back for a moment the most prepossessingthing about the young man was his name a light breeze tugged at his shaggy hairand baggy work tunic as he regarded the device no point in staying angry at it hecounseled himself only an unintelligent machine 
 as luke considered his predicament a third figure appeared scooting out frombehind the vaporator to fumble awkwardly at the damaged section only three of thetreadwell model six arms were functioning and these had seen more wearthan the boots on feet the machine moved with unsteady 
 luke gazed at it sadly then inclined his head to study the sky still no sign of acloud and he knew there never would be unless he got that vaporator working hewas about to try once again when a small intense gleam of light caught his he slipped the carefully cleaned set of macrobinoculars from his utility beltand focused the lenses skyward 
 for long moments he stared wishing all the while that he had a real telescopeinstead of the binocs as he stared vaporators the heat and the remainingchores were forgotten clipping the binoculars back onto his belt luke turned anddashed for the landspeeder halfway to the vehicle he thought to call behind him 
 hurry up he shouted impatiently what are you waiting for get it ingear 
 the treadwell started toward him hesitated and then commenced spinning in atight circle smoke belching from every joint luke shouted further instruction thenfinally gave up in disgust when he realized that it would take more than words tomotivate the treadwell again 
 for a moment luke hesitated at leaving the machine he argued tohimself its vital components were obviously shot so he jumped into thelandspeeder causing the recently repaired repulsion floater to list alarmingly to oneside until he was able to equalize weight distribution by sliding behind the its altitude slightly above the sandy ground the transportvehicle steadied itself like a boat in a heavy sea luke gunned the engine whichwhined in protest and sand erupted behind the floater as he aimed the craft toward thedistant town of anchorhead 
 behind him a pitiful beacon of black smoke from the burning robot continued torise into the clear desert air it be there when luke returned there werescavengers of metal as well as flesh in the wide wastes of tatooine 
 metal and stone structures bleached white by the glaze of twin tatoo i and iihuddled together tightly for company as much as for protection they formed thenexus of the widespread farming community of anchorhead 
 presently the dusty unpaved streets were quiet deserted sandflies buzzedlazily in the cracked eaves of pourstone building a dog barked in the distance thesole sign of habitation until a lone old woman appeared and started across the metallic sun shawl was pulled tight around her 
 something made her look up tired eyes squinting into the distance the soundsuddenly leaped in volume as a shining rectangular shape came roaring around a farcorner her eyes popped as the vehicle bore down on her showing no sign ofaltering its path she had to scramble to get out of its way 
 panting and waving an angry fist after the landspeeder she raised her voice overthe sound of its passage you kids ever learn to slow down 
 luke might have seen her but he certainly hear her in both cases hisattention was focused elsewhere as he pulled up behind a low long concrete coils and rods jutted from its top and sides relentless sand wavesbroke in frozen yellow spume against the walls no one had bothered toclear them away there was no point they would only return again the followingday 
 luke slammed the front door aside and shouted hey 
 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 for a moment luke hesitated at leaving the machine he argued tohimself its vital components were obviously shot so he jumped into thelandspeeder causing the recently repaired repulsion floater to list alarmingly to oneside until he was able to equalize weight distribution by sliding behind the its altitude slightly above the sandy ground the transportvehicle steadied itself like a boat in a heavy sea luke gunned the engine whichwhined in protest and sand erupted behind the floater as he aimed the craft toward thedistant town of anchorhead 
 behind him a pitiful beacon of black smoke from the burning robot continued torise into the clear desert air it be there when luke returned there werescavengers of metal as well as flesh in the wide wastes of tatooine 
 metal and stone structures bleached white by the glaze of twin tatoo i and iihuddled together tightly for company as much as for protection they formed thenexus of the widespread farming community of anchorhead 
 presently the dusty unpaved streets were quiet deserted sandflies buzzedlazily in the cracked eaves of pourstone building a dog barked in the distance thesole sign of habitation until a lone old woman appeared and started across the metallic sun shawl was pulled tight around her 
 something made her look up tired eyes squinting into the distance the soundsuddenly leaped in volume as a shining rectangular shape came roaring around a farcorner her eyes popped as the vehicle bore down on her showing no sign ofaltering its path she had to scramble to get out of its way 
 panting and waving an angry fist after the landspeeder she raised her voice overthe sound of its passage you kids ever learn to slow down 
 luke might have seen her but he certainly hear her in both cases hisattention was focused elsewhere as he pulled up behind a low long concrete coils and rods jutted from its top and sides relentless sand wavesbroke in frozen yellow spume against the walls no one had bothered toclear them away there was no point they would only return again the followingday 
 luke slammed the front door aside and shouted hey 
 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 the vicomte was a young man with soft features andpolished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but outof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him upas a treat to her guests as a clever maitre serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seenit in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna servedup to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarlychoice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussingthe murder of the duc the vicomte said that the had perished by his own magnanimity and that there wereparticular reasons for hatred of him 
 ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv inthe sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte 
 the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingnessto comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyoneto listen to his tale 
 the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to ofthe guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she toanother how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to athird and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a joint of roast beefon a hot dish 
 the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 
 come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother group 
 the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile withwhich she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectlybeautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmedwith moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair andsparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciouslyallowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure andshapely shoulders back and bosom which in the fashion of those dayswere very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of aballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was solovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but onthe contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all toovictorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminishits effect 
 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile 
 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said inclining his head 
 the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time thestory was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautifulround arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at herstill more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress andwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna atonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
 the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
 wait a moment get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag 
 there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself inher seat 
 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her work 
 prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circleand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 
 le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact thatin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his featureswere like his but while in her case everything was lit up bya joyous youthful and constant smile of by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on thecontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen while his body was thin and weak his and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions 
 not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak 
 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile 
 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said inclining his head 
 the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time thestory was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautifulround arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at herstill more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress andwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna atonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
 the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
 wait a moment get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag 
 there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself inher seat 
 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her work 
 prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circleand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 
 le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact thatin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his featureswere like his but while in her case everything was lit up bya joyous youthful and constant smile of by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on thecontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen while his body was thin and weak his and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions 
 not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak 
 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 chapter 
 
 while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly i asked the reason she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious 
 too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed the whole furniture consisted of a chair a and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and everyone else 
 the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and again to catherine linton 
 in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a bore the inscription catherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a least the appearance of every morsel of blank that the printer had left some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend yet powerfully sketched an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics 
 an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to heathcliff is and i are going to took our initiatory step this evening 
 all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable anything but reading their bibles answer for myself and the unhappy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers 
 you forget you have a master here says the tyrant demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the palaver that we should be ashamed of we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks 
 t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath nut und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye dahn ill childer good books eneugh if read em sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls 
 saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub 
 maister hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither miss riven th back off th helmet uh salvation un pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh t brooad way to destruction fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait ech th owd man ud uh laced em goan 
 hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter a pleasant then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here 
 
 
 i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose 
 how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i give over poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place 
 
 i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print i saw a red ornamented times seven and the first of the a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabes branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabes branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering 
 i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a cudgel which i understood to be so denominated for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence then a new idea flashed across me i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabes branderham preach from the times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated 
 we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously 
 oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned hear all out finally he reached the first of the at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabes branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon 
 sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and is too much have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more 
 thou art the man cries jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy times seven did i take counsel with my this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints 
 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously 
 oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned hear all out finally he reached the first of the at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabes branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon 
 sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and is too much have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more 
 thou art the man cries jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy times seven did i take counsel with my this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints 
 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 chapter three 
 
 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right

 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right

 the drops onto the table startling her 
 
 sorry mean to scare ya 
 elvelyn

 mister are your manners

 evelyn 
 if you call that a kiss 
 reaches into the and starts pulling out 
 revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
 and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite 
 evelyn

 dismantling and cleaning the guns 
 
 something out there you

 evelyn 
 yes hoping to find a certain 
 artifact a book actually my 
 brother thinks treasure 
 what do you think is out there 
 looks into eyes 
 
 evil the tuaregs and the bedouin 
 believe that hamunaptra is cursed 
 they call it the doorway to hell 
 evelyn 
 ahmar is ossirion passageway 
 to the underworld actually 
 she gives him a grin 
 evelyn 
 i believe in fairy tales 
 and hokum mister connell but 
 i do believe that one of the most 
 famous books in history is buried 
 out there the book of the living 
 what first interested me in 
 egypt as a child why i came 
 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert

 up at evelyn she smiles broadly and waves down at him 
 office night

 blue tinted skin hideous facial tattoos the works one of 
 the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand he shrugs 
 hook

 curator

 beni

 passenger barge surrounded by daniels henderson and burns

 docks across the nile the pyramids spike the sky evelyn 
 and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers 
 selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures 
 evelyn

 he may be a cowboy but his 
 word is his word 
 evelyn

 and polished with a new haircut and clothes he looks more 
 dashing and handsome than ever evelyn is suitably impressed 
 evelyn

 jonathan grabs arm and shakes his hand 
 jonathan 
 smashing day for the start of 
 an adventure eh 
 quickly checks his pockets

 he finds his wallet and relaxes directly above him on the 
 bow of the barge burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni 
 burns 
 sure hamunaptra is out there 
 beni 
 along with the scorched bones 
 of my entire garrison sahib 
 and when beni spots beni shakes his head 
 as if seeing a mirage then starts backing away from the men 
 beni 
 a thousand pardons my good sahibs 
 but there is much work to be done 
 beni quickly scurries off vanishing down into the hold 
 back down with evelyn recovering she clears her throat 
 evelyn 
 mister can you look 
 me in the eye and guarantee me 
 this is not some sort of flimflam 
 because if it is warning you 
 steps up close to evelyn invading her space 
 looks her straight in the eye evelyn back away 
 
 all i can tell you miss is that my 
 colonel found that map in an ancient 
 fortress and the whole damn garrison 
 believed in it so much that without 
 orders we marched halfway across 
 libya and into egypt to find that city 
 like i told ya all i saw was sand 
 everybody else was by 
 tuareg warriors take your bags 
 takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
 the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on 
 eyes follow him a bit wistfully jonathan sees it 
 jonathan 
 yes yes right filthy 
 rude a complete scoundrel 
 nothing to like there at all 
 evelyn gives him a look jonathan just grins and when 
 the warden suddenly brushes past tipping his raggedy hat 
 warden 
 a bright good morning to all 
 evelyn

 warden 
 i have come to protect my 
 investment thank you very much 
 and up the plank he goes evelyn and jonathan share a look 
 we go wide again as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
 nile we tilt up to the sun which then dissolves into 
 ext river nile night 
 the moon shining down on the desert the three vicious 
 mumia quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river the 
 one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff the other 
 two row heading for the passenger barge coming their way 
 ext the bar at the bow night 
 jonathan and the three americans are playing poker 
 comes out a door carrying a

 shutting him up jonathan quickly covers 
 jonathan

 ext barge night 
 evelyn sits on a table staring out over the passing river 
 the drops onto the table startling her 
 
 sorry mean to scare ya 
 elvelyn 
 the only thing that scares me 
 mister are your manners 
 
 still angry that i kissed ya huh 
 evelyn 
 if you call that a kiss 
 reaches into the and starts pulling out 
 revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
 and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite 
 evelyn 
 did i miss something are we 
 going into battle 
 
 the last time i was at that place 
 everybody i was with died 
 this takes the smile off face starts 
 dismantling and cleaning the guns 
 
 something out there you 
 know something under that sand 
 evelyn 
 yes hoping to find a certain 
 artifact a book actually my 
 brother thinks treasure 
 what do you think is out there 
 looks into eyes 
 
 evil the tuaregs and the bedouin 
 believe that hamunaptra is cursed 
 they call it the doorway to hell 
 evelyn 
 ahmar is ossirion passageway 
 to the underworld actually 
 she gives him a grin 
 evelyn 
 i believe in fairy tales 
 and hokum mister connell but 
 i do believe that one of the most 
 famous books in history is buried 
 out there the book of the living 
 what first interested me in 
 egypt as a child why i came 
 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert
