 athenian stranger enough of this and what then is to be regardedas the origin of government will not a man be able to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 ath i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages 
 cle how so 
 ath why do you think that you can reckon the time which haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them 
 cle hardly 
 ath but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and have not thousands and thousands of cities come intobeing during this period and as many perished and has not each ofthem had every form of government many times over now growing smaller and again improving or declining 
 cle to be sure 
 ath let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes forthat will probably explain the first origin and development of formsof government 
 cle very good you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to we will make an effort to understand you 
 ath do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions 
 cle what traditions 
 ath the traditions about the many destructions of mankind whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many otherways and of the survival of a remnant 
 cle every one is disposed to believe them 
 ath let us consider one of them that which was caused by thefamous deluge 
 cle what are we to observe about it 
 ath i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be sparks of the human race preserved on the tops ofmountains 
 cle clearly 
 ath such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers incities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which theycontrive against one another 
 cle very true 
 ath let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on were utterly destroyed at that time 
 cle very good 
 ath would not all implements have then perished and every otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom haveutterly disappeared 
 cle why yes my friend and if things had always continued as theyare at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been madeeven in the least particular for it is evident that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years and no more thana thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries ofdaedalus orpheus and marsyas and olympus inventedmusic and amphion the to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday 
 ath have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who isreally of yesterday 
 cle i suppose that you mean epimenides 
 ath the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads ofall mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as youdeclare what of old hesiod only preached 
 cle yes according to our tradition 
 ath after the great destruction may we not suppose that thestate of man was something of this the beginning of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them 
 cle true 
 ath and of cities or governments or legislation about which we arenow talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection atall 
 cle none whatever 
 ath and out of this state of things has there not sprung all thatwe now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attainedtheir full development whether of virtue or of vice 
 cle i understand your meaning and you are quite right 
 ath but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world cameto be what the world is 
 cle very true 
 ath doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but littleby little during a very long period of time 
 cle a highly probable supposition 
 ath at first they would have a natural fear ringing in theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights into theplain 
 cle of course 
 ath the fewness of the survivors at that time would have madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely i may say with the loss of the arts and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor wasthere any possibility of extracting ore from them and they hadscarcely any means of felling timber even if you suppose that someimplements might have been preserved in the mountains they mustquickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of themuntil the art of metallurgy had again revived 
 cle there could not have been 
 ath in how many generations would this be attained 
 cle clearly not for many generations 
 ath during this period and for some time afterwards all thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear 
 cle certainly 
 ath faction and war would also have died out in those days and formany reasons 
 cle how would that be 
 ath in the first place the desolation of these primitive men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and towards oneanother and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel abouttheir subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance exceptjust at first and in some particular cases and from they would obtain the greater part of their food in aprimitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantityor quality they would also have abundance of clothing and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron and god has given these two arts to man in order to providehim with all such things that when reduced to the last human race may still grow and increase hence in those daysmankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong them and rich they could not have been having neither gold at that time was their condition and the community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblestprinciples in it there is no insolence or injustice nor there any contentions or envyings and therefore they were also because they were what is called and when theywere told about good and evil they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard to be very truth and practised it no one had thewit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what theyheard about gods and men they believed to be true and livedaccordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed them 
 cle that quite accords with my views and with those of my friendhere 
 ath would not many generations living on in a simple ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise ofother arts termed in cities legal practices and party including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand inferior to those who lived before the deluge orto the men of our day in these respects would they not i say besimpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether morejust the reason has been already explained 
 cle very true 
 ath i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and whatis about to follow has been and will be said with the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and whowas their lawgiver 
 cle and thus far what you have said has been very well said 
 ath they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no lettersat this early period they lived by habit and the customs of theirancestors as they are called 
 cle probably 
 ath but there was already existing a form of government which if iam not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this stillremains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is thegovernment which is declared by homer to have prevailed among thecyclopes 
 they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to hiswife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another 
 cle that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read someother verses of his which are very clever but i do not know muchof him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans 
 megillus but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be theprince of them all the manner of life however which he describes isnot spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what youare saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism 
 ath yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise 
 cle we may 
 ath and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty which attended thedevastations and did not the eldest then rule among them becausewith them government originated in the authority of a father and amother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming onetroop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their of all sovereignties is the most just 
 cle very true 
 ath after this they came together in greater numbers and increasedthe size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first ofall at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thuscreating a single large and common habitation 
 cle yes at least we may suppose so 
 ath there is another thing which would probably happen 
 cle what 
 ath when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing totheir separation from one another would have peculiar customs inthings divine and human which they would have received from theirseveral parents who had educated them and these customs would inclinethem to order when the parents had the element of order in theirnature and to courage when they had the element of courage and theywould naturally stamp upon their children and upon their their own likings and as we are saying they would findtheir way into the larger society having already their own peculiarlaws 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws ofothers not so well 
 cle true 
 ath then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings oflegislation 
 cle exactly 
 ath the next step will be that these persons who have met select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs wholead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them tochoose those which they think best these persons will themselves becalled legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing somesort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties orlordships and in this altered state of the government they will live 
 cle yes that would be the natural order of things 
 ath then now let us speak of a third form of government inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur 
 cle what is that 
 ath the form which in fact homer indicates as following the third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania 
 for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be acity of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes hespeaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race andoften in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces theyattain truth 
 cle yes 
 ath then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our we do so 
 cle by all means 
 ath ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in alarge and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many riversdescending from ida 
 cle such is the tradition 
 ath and we must suppose this event to have taken place many agesafter the deluge 
 ath a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction wouldappear to have come over them when they placed their town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their securityto not very high hills either 
 cle there must have been a long interval clearly 
 ath and as population increased many other cities would beginto be inhabited 
 cle doubtless 
 ath those cities made war against sea as well as that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea 
 cle clearly 
 ath the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy 
 cle true 
 ath and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besiegingilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their owncities and families they did not receive them properly and as theyought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were theconsequence the exiles came again under a new name no longerachaeans but name which they derived from dorieus for itwas he who gathered them together the rest of the story is told byyou lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta 
 meg to be sure 
 ath thus after digressing from the original subject of laws intomusic and the argument has providentially comeback to the same point and presents to us another handle for we havereached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is inlaws and in institutions the sister of crete and we are all thebetter for the digression because we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements and have been present at the foundationof a first second and third state succeeding one another ininfinite time and now there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled to this day if out of all this we are able to discernwhat is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation andwhat are the destruction of cities and what changes would make astate happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion 
 meg if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the present i would goa great way to hear such another and would think that a day as longas we are now approaching the longest day of the tooshort for the discussion 
 ath then i suppose that we must consider this subject 
 meg certainly 
 ath let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemonand argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all incomplete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards asthe legend informs us they divided their army into three settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon 
 meg true 
 ath temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of and eurysthenes of lacedaemon 
 meg certainly 
 ath to these kings all the men of that day made oath that theywould assist them if any one subverted their kingdom 
 meg true 
 ath but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form ofgovernment ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves noindeed by zeus have we already forgotten what was said a littlewhile ago 
 meg no 
 ath and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the sameprinciple so that in resuming the discussion we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory but about events which actuallyhappened the case was as royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly government and the cities tothe kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws which were common to all of them the rulerspromised that as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulersobserved these conditions they would never subvert or permit othersto subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings andpeoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin like manner is not this the fact 
 meg yes 
 ath and the three states to whom these laws were given whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions 
 meg what security 
 ath that the other two states were always to come to the rescueagainst a rebellious third 
 meg true 
 ath many persons say that legislators ought to impose such lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner 
 meg exactly 
 ath whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore health and make the body whole without any very greatinfliction of pain 
 meg certainly 
 ath there was also another advantage possessed by the men of thatday which greatly lightened the task of passing laws 
 meg what advantage 
 ath the legislators of that day when they equalized the great accusation which generally arises in legislation ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolishdebts because he sees that without this reform there can never be anyreal equality now in general when the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry is not to disturb vested with imprecationsthat he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts untila man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with thedorians for distributing the was nothing to hinder as for debts they had none which were considerable or of oldstanding 
 meg very true 
 ath but then my good friends why did the settlement andlegislation of their country turn out so badly 
 meg how do you mean and why do you blame them 
 ath there were three kingdoms and of these two quicklycorrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one whichremained was the spartan 
 meg the question which you ask is not easily answered 
 ath and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws thisbeing our old sober game of play whereby we beguile the way asi was saying when we first set out on our journey 
 meg certainly and we must find out why this was 
 ath what laws are more worthy of our attention than those whichhave regulated such cities or what settlements of states aregreater or more famous 
 meg i know of none 
 ath can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all thehellenes in case they were attacked by the barbarian for theinhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by theirinsolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians andthe empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige thepeople of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we nowfear the great king and the second capture of troy was a seriousoffence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrianempire to meet the danger the single army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers sons of fair device asit seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition againsttroy for firstly the people of that day had as they thought inthe heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next considered that their army was superior in valour to that whichwent against troy for although the latter conquered the were themselves conquered by the bydorians may we not suppose that this was the intention with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of their states 
 meg quite true 
 ath and would not men who had shared with one another many were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had takenthe advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo belikely to think that such states would be firmly and lastinglyestablished 
 meg of course they would 
 ath yet these institutions of which such great expectations wereentertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with theexception as i was saying of that small part of them which existedin this third part has never to this day ceased warringagainst the two others whereas if the original idea had been carriedout and they had agreed to be one their power would have beeninvincible in war 
 meg no doubt 
 ath but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy here is asubject well worthy of consideration 
 meg certainly no one will ever find more striking instances oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great andnoble interests than are here presented to his view 
 ath then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant question 
 meg very true 
 ath did you never remark sage friend that all men and weourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and notaccording to nature either in our own case or in any other 
 meg to what are you referring and what do you mean 
 ath i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidheracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had suchwonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i wasjust laughing at myself 
 meg but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did andwe in assenting to you 
 ath perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one whosees anything great or powerful immediately has the the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession how happy would he be and what great results would heachieve 
 meg and would he not be justified 
 ath reflect in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear just first in reference to the question in thethen commanders had known how to arrange their army properly howwould they have attained success would not this have been the would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combinedwith the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and they and their descendants desired what other aim would theyhave had 
 meg very good 
 ath suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires 
 meg he would 
 ath well now and does not the argument show that there is onecommon desire of all mankind 
 meg what is it 
 ath the desire which a man has that all things if anyrate things come to pass in accordance with his 
 meg certainly 
 ath and having this desire always and at every time of life inyouth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for thefulfilment of it 
 meg no doubt 
 ath and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for themwhat they ask for themselves 
 meg we do 
 ath dear is the son to the younger to the elder 
 meg of course 
 ath and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the fatherprays that he may not obtain 
 meg when the son is young and foolish you mean 
 ath yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat ofyouth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour underthe influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having asense of right and justice will join in his prayers 
 meg i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wishmay be at variance with his reason but every state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom 
 ath yes and i remember and you will remember what i said atfirst that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with aview to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war and to this i replied that there werefour virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aimof legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especiallythat which comes first and is the leader of all the meanwisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in theirtrain and now the argument returns to the same point and i sayonce more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that theprayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in theopposite of what he desires and if you would rather receive mywords in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find isuspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design norignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs that was then and is still and always will be thecase as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out anddemonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in thecourse of the argument 
 cle pray go on are troublesome but wewill show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your we will give them our best attention and that is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval 
 meg excellent cleinias let us do as you say 
 cle by all means if heaven wills go on 
 ath well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that then ignorance is ruin and if this be true the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power 
 cle that is evident 
 ath then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance ishould like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me inwhat i am about to say for my opinion is 
 cle what 
 ath that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil this disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soulis in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest becauseaffecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle whichfeels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just asin the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers andthe laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather thereverse of good all these cases i term the worst ignorance whetherin individuals or in states you will understand stranger that iam speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen 
 cle yes my friend we understand and agree 
 ath let us then in the first place declare and affirm that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant eventhough he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite areto be called wise even although in the words of the proverb theyknow neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men ofsense authority is to be committed for o my friends how canthere be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony there isnone but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said tobe the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who livesaccording to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of thestate he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom let this i was saying be laid down by us 
 cle let it be so laid down 
 ath i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what are the principles on which men rule and obey incities whether great or small and similarly in families what arethey and how many in number is there not one claim of authoritywhich is always of fathers and mothers and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring 
 cle there is 
 ath next follows the principle that the noble should rule overthe ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and theyounger obey 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their mastersrule 
 cle of course 
 ath fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that thestronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled 
 cle that is a rule not to be disobeyed 
 ath yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said andthe sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise shouldlead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thoumost wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contraryto nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willingsubjects and not a rule of compulsion 
 cle most true 
 ath there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and isdear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot fallsis a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is thesubject and this we affirm to be quite just 
 cle certainly 
 ath then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightlyundertake the making of laws you see legislator the principlesof government how many they are and that they are naturallyopposed to each other there we have discovered a ofseditions to which you must attend and first we will ask you toconsider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos andmessene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the greatand famous hellenic power of the olden time was it because they didnot know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is oftenmore than the whole his meaning was that when to take the wholewould be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe andmoderate course then the moderate or better was more than theimmoderate or worse 
 cle very true 
 ath and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples 
 cle the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especiallyprevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life 
 ath is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that timewas to get the better of the established laws and that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe byword and oath this want of harmony may have had the appearance ofwisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance andutterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord 
 cle very likely 
 ath good and what measures ought the legislator to have then takenin order to avert this calamity truly there is no great wisdom inknowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil hashappened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath any one who looks at what has occurred with you may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone at that time 
 meg speak a little more clearly 
 ath nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about tomake 
 meg what is it 
 ath that if any one gives too great a power to anything toolarge a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too muchauthority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything isoverthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case todisorders and in the other to injustice which is the child ofexcess i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul ofman young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary one who will not under suchcircumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases andbe hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens hiskingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him andgreat legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger asfar as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was asfollows 
 meg what 
 ath a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gaveyou two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you morewithin the limits of moderation in the next place some humanwisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and excited tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of the power of your elders equal with that of thekings in the most important matters but your third that your government was still swelling and foaming anddesirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whosepower he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and bythis arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the rightelements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means ofpreserving all the rest since if there had been only the originallegislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far asthey were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would havebeen preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation orthey would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny now that god has instructed us what sort of governmentwould have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i havealready said in judging after the event there is no difficulty inlearning from an example which has already occurred but if any onecould have foreseen all this at the time and had been able tomoderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into might have saved all the excellent institutions which were thenconceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared toattack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised 
 cle true 
 ath there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win gloriousvictories both by land and sea but what in my opinion broughtdiscredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty waragainst lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from renderingassistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian would not answer to the call or give aid many thingsmight be told about hellas in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellasrepelled the invader for the truth is that unless the atheniansand lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impendingyoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofhellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling withhellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are nowsubject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations andcombinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to makeagainst statesmen and legislators as they are called past andpresent if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find outwhat else might have been done we said for instance just there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious andthat a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end nor isthere any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which appear not to be always the same but we shouldconsider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is tobe the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims arereally the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression oughtnot to disturb us 
 cle let us resume the argument in that spirit and now speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me atwhat in your opinion the legislator should aim 
 ath hear me then there are two mother forms of states fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highestform of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i wassaying are variations of these now if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both theseforms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declaresthat no city can be well governed which is not made up of both 
 cle impossible 
 ath neither the one if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached tofreedom observes moderation but your states the laconian andcretan have more of it and the same was the case with theathenians and persians of old time but now they have less shall itell you why 
 cle by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject 
 ath hear was a time when the persians had more ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom in the reign ofcyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals thesoldiers were on better terms with their generals and showedthemselves more ready in the hour of danger and if there was any wiseman among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted hiswisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed himfull liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advisehim in any matter and the nation waxed in all respects because therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them 
 cle that certainly appears to have been the case 
 ath how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and againrecovered under darius shall i try to divine 
 cle the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject 
 ath i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general hadnever given his mind to education and never attended to the orderof his household 
 cle what makes you say so 
 ath i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier andentrusted the education of his children to the women and they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who wereblessed already and needed no more blessings they thought thatthey were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to opposethem in any way and they compelled every one to praise all thatthey said or did this was how they brought them up 
 cle a splendid education truly 
 ath such an one as women were likely to give them and especiallyprincesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to lookafter them 
 cle what would you expect 
 ath their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and manyherds of men and other animals but he did not consider that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his owncalling which was persian for the persians are of arugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep andalso to fight if fighting is required he did not observe that hissons were trained differently through the blessing of beingroyal they were educated in the median fashion by women and led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought up unreproved and so after the death of cyrus his the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and firstone slew the other because he could not endure a rival the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality losthis kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called despised the folly of cambyses 
 cle so runs the tale and such probably were the facts 
 ath yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to thepersians through darius and the seven chiefs 
 cle true 
 ath let us note the rest of the story observe that darius was notthe son of a king and had not received a luxurious education when hecame to the throne being one of the seven he divided the countryinto seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowytraces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in hislaws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus a feeling of friendship and community among all the attaching the people to him with money and gifts hence his armiescheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrushad left behind him darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion might wenot most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in thesame way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see hisfatal mistake for xerxes being the creation of the sameeducation met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from thattime until now there has never been a really great king among thepersians although they are all called great and their degeneracyis not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is ratherthe evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich androyal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel invirtue who has been thus educated and this i say is what thelegislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to beconsidered by us justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised inthat you do not give special honour or a special education to wealthrather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a privatestation where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originallycommanded them to be given for no man ought to have in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more thanbecause he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have somevirtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have thisparticular virtue of temperance 
 meg what do you mean stranger 
 ath i suppose that courage is a part of virtue 
 meg to be sure 
 ath then now hear and judge for you like to havefor a or neighbour a very courageous man who had nocontrol over himself 
 meg heaven forbid 
 ath or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue 
 meg certainly not 
 ath and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance 
 meg impossible 
 ath any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to truereason can be intemperate 
 meg no 
 ath there is a further consideration relating to the due andundue award of honours in states 
 meg what is it 
 ath i should like to know whether temperance without the othervirtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praisedor blamed 
 meg i cannot tell 
 ath and that is the best answer for whichever alternative youhad chosen i think that you would have gone wrong 
 meg i am fortunate 
 ath very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things whichcan be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of is best passed over in silence 
 meg you are speaking of temperance 
 ath yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendageis also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a regular order 
 meg true 
 ath and ought not the legislator to determine these classes 
 meg certainly he should 
 ath suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details butthe general division of laws according to their importance into afirst and second and third class we who are lovers of law may makeourselves 
 meg very good 
 ath we maintain then that a state which would be safe andhappy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way and the right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest in the assuming temperance to be the condition of them and toassign the second place to the goods of the body and the thirdplace to money and property and it any legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any waypreferring that which is really last may we not say that he or thestate is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing 
 meg yes let that be plainly declared 
 ath the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far toenlarge we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse and weaffirm the reason of this to have been that they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much ofdespotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling andwhen there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf ofthemselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire anddesolation among friendly races and as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fightfor them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless tothem on the field of battle and they think that their salvationdepends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they if they were in want of more men and they cannot help beingstupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle when compared with gold and silver 
 meg quite true 
 ath and now enough of the persians and their presentmaladministration of their government which is owing to the excess ofslavery and despotism among them 
 meg good 
 ath next we must pass in review the government of attica in likemanner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so good as government byothers when properly limited which was our ancient athenianconstitution at the time when the persians made their attack onhellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of were four classes arranged according to a property reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing tolive in obedience to the laws which then prevailed also thevastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused ahelpless terror which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed among us about ten years before the naval engagement atsalamis datis came leading a persian host by command of was expressly directed against the athenians and orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was toexecute under pain of death now datis and his myriads soon becamecomplete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athensthat no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of eretria and this report whether wellor ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to theathenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no onewas willing to come to their relief with the exception of thelacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by themessenian war which was then going on or for some other reason ofwhich we are not told came a day too late for the battle of a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made andinnumerable threats came from the king then as time went on arumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who wasyoung and had come to the throne and was persisting in hisdesign the athenians were under the impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them in consequence of the battleof marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and thecanal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was nosalvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one tohelp them and remembering that in the first expedition when thepersians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would riskthe danger of an alliance with them they thought that this wouldhappen again at least on land nor when they looked to the they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by athousand vessels and more one chance of safety remained slightindeed and desperate but their only one they saw that on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory andborne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was inthemselves and in the gods all these things created in them thespirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and therewas that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to theirancient laws and which i have several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be awilling servant and of which the coward is independent andfearless if this fear had not possessed them they would never havemet the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry and everything that was near and dear to them as they little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed 
 meg your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourselfand of your country 
 ath they are true megillus and to you who have inherited thevirtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of thatday and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking but for the to remark that the experience both of ourselves and thepersians was in a certain sense the same for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude so we too led ours into all now how shall we proceed for i would like you to observe thatour previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves 
 meg true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation 
 ath i will under the ancient laws my friends the people wasnot as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws 
 meg what laws do you mean 
 ath in the first place let us speak of the laws about to say such music as then order that we may trace thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning now music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners one sortconsisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations and anothertermed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus believe dithyrambs and they used the actual word laws ornomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the all these and others were duly distinguished norwere the performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother and the authority which determined and gave judgment andpunished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the mostunmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause andclapping of hands but the directors of public instruction insistedthat the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boysand their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by ahint from a stick such was the good order which the multitude werewilling to observe they would never have dared to give judgment bynoisy cries and then as time went on the poets themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation they were menof genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful inmusic raging like bacchanals and possessed with lamentations with hymns and paeans with the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making onegeneral confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer and by composing such licentious works andadding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves about melody and song and in this way the theatresfrom being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding ofgood and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up for if the democracy whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm wouldhave been done but in music there first arose the universal conceitof omniscience and general came followingafterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not no longer any fear and the absence of fear begetsshamelessness for what is this shamelessness which is so evil athing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better byreason of an sort of liberty 
 meg very true 
 ath consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom ofdisobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control andexhortation of father mother elders and when near the end thecontrol of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges and no regard at all for the theyexhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come tothe same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading alife of endless evils but why have i said all this i ask becausethe argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not beallowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shallnot as the proverb says fall off our ass let us then once moreask the question to what end has all this been said 
 meg very good 
 ath this then has been said for the sake 
 meg of what 
 ath we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have threethings in view first that the city for which he legislates should befree and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should were our principles were they not 
 meg certainly 
 ath with a view to this we selected two kinds of government thedespotic and the other the most free and now we are consideringwhich of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases ofdespotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw thatin a mean they attained their perfection but that when they werecarried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither partywere the gainers 
 meg very true 
 ath and that was our reason for considering the settlement of thedorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of themountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of ourmention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge andall that was previously said about music and drinking and whatpreceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be bestadministered and how an individual might best order his own life andnow megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value ofour words 
 cle stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value maybe obtained this discussion of ours appears to me to have beensingularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want mostauspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way for iwill tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence asa sort of omen the greater part of crete is going to send out acolony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to thecnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others and theydesire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken fromthe cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign if they are better grant me then this favour whichwill also be a gain to us make a selection from whathas been said and then let us imagine a state of which we willsuppose ourselves to be the original founders thus we shall proceedwith our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of theframework which you are constructing for the city which is incontemplation 
 ath good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you maybe sure that i will do all in my power to please you 
 cle thank you 
 meg and so will i 
 cle excellent and now let us begin to frame the state

 book iv 
 
 athenian stranger and now what will this city be i do not mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the original or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a nameto the city but i do want to know what the situationis whether maritime or inland 
 cleinias i should imagine stranger that the city of which weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea 
 ath and are there harbours on the seaboard 
 cle excellent harbours stranger there could not be better 
 ath alas what a prospect and is the surrounding countryproductive or in need of importations 
 cle hardly in need of anything 
 ath and is there any neighbouring state 
 cle none whatever and that is the reason for selecting theplace in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial 
 ath and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain andwood 
 cle like the rest of crete in that 
 ath you mean to say that there is more rock than plain 
 cle exactly 
 ath then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous hadyou been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importingrather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have beenneeded and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance ofmanners but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the seais too near especially if as you say the harbours are so we may be content the sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting inthe souls of men uncertain and unfaithful the stateunfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also toother nations there is a consolation therefore in the countryproducing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness ofthe soil not providing anything in great abundance had there beenabundance there might have been a great export trade and a greatreturn of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has themost fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of justand noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in theprevious discussion 
 cle i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are inthe right 
 ath well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timberfor 
 cle there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not muchcypress and you will find very little or whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships 
 ath these are also natural advantages 
 cle why so 
 ath because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies in what is mischievous 
 cle how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we havebeen speaking 
 ath remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretanlaws that they look to one thing only and this as you bothagreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as theytended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded apart only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them and nowi hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislatewith a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtueonly for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims onlyat that on which some eternal beauty is always attending anddismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit whenseparated from virtue i was saying that the imitation of enemieswas a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as weknow was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants ofattica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no shipsof war as they now have nor was the country filled and therefore they could not readily build them hencethey could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in thisway becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies betterfor them to have lost many times over the seven youths than and stationary troops should have been turned intosailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again tocome running back to their ships or should have fancied that therewas no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for aman throwing away his arms and betaking himself to isnot dishonourable as people say at certain times this is thelanguage of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinarypraise for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the bestpart of the citizens you may learn the evil of such a practice fromhomer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because hedesires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when theachaeans are hard pressed by the gets angry with him andsays 
 who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans maybe accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us for theachaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn intothe sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in thatthe counsel which you give will prove see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhoodof fighting men to be an might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer moreover naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving of it for he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due but howcan a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour 
 cle it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was thesalvation of hellas 
 ath why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread bothamong hellenes and barbarians but megillus and i say rather that thebattle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea thecompletion of the great deliverance and that these battles by landmade the hellenes better whereas the of salamis i may as well put them both them nobetter if i may say so without offence about the battles which helpedto save us and in estimating the goodness of a state we regardboth the situation of the country and the order of the that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but thecontinuance of the best life while we live and that again if i amjot mistaken is remark which has been made already 
 cle yes 
 ath then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation ofstates 
 cle the best by far 
 ath and now let me proceed to another question who are to be thecolonists may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too numerous for the means ofsubsistence for i suppose that you are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any hellene who likes to come and yet i observethat to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina andother parts of hellas tell me then whence do you draw your recruitsin the present enterprise 
 cle they will come from all crete and of other will be most acceptable for as you truly are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which hasthe highest character at the present day is the gortynian and thishas come from gortys in the peloponnesus 
 ath cities find colonization in some respects easier if thecolonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out froma single country either when friends leave friends owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate and there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by asuperior power in war this however which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates adifficulty there is an element of friendship in the community ofrace and language and language and laws and in common templesand rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering from that which they had at home and although the badnessof their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of thecolony who is their legislator finds them troublesome andrebellious on the other hand the conflux of several populationsmight be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make themcombine and pull together as they say of horses is a mostdifficult task and the work of years and yet there is nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation andcolonization 
 cle no doubt but i should like to know why you say so 
 ath my good friend i am afraid that the course of myspeculations is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be noharm and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the sameprinciple applies equally to all human things 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i was going to say that man never legislates but accidentsof all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways theviolence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning governments and changing laws and the power of discasehas often caused innovations in the state when there have beenpestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing during many years any one who sees all this naturallyrushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortallegislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and thepilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be wellsaid and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth of all of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath that god governs all things and that chance and with him in the government of human affairs there a third and less extreme view that art should be there i should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage in having the aid of the art you would agree 
 cle yes 
 ath and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well asto other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the state yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear on the scene 
 cle most true 
 ath in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly forcertain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he wouldthen only require to exercise his art 
 cle certainly 
 ath and all the other artists just now mentioned if they werebidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so 
 cle of course 
 ath and the legislator would do likewise 
 cle i believe that he would 
 ath come legislator we will say to him what are theconditions which you require in a state before you can organize ought he to answer this question shall i give his answer 
 cle yes 
 ath he will me a state which is governed by a tyrant andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick atlearning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have thatquality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them 
 cle i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which thestranger speaks must be temperance 
 ath yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers iscalled prudence but that which is the natural gift of children andanimals of whom some live continently and others incontinently butwhen isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogueof goods i think that you must understand my meaning 
 cle certainly 
 ath then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny 
 cle by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuadehimself of such a monstrous doctrine 
 ath there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is inaccordance with the order of nature 
 cle you would assume as you say a tyrant who was quick at learning having a good memory courageous of anoble nature 
 ath yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happychance brings them together when this has been accomplished godhas done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers and third best for a state in which thereare three the difficulty increases with the increase anddiminishes with the diminution of the number 
 cle you mean to say i suppose that the best government isproduced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and anorderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfectform of government takes place most easily less easily when from anoligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not thatyour meaning 
 ath not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made outof a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out ofsome sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comesoligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such achange because the government is in the hands of a number ofpotentates i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of thetrue sort and that his strength is united with that of the chiefmen of the state and when the ruling element is numerically at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change islikely to be easiest and most rapid 
 cle how i do not understand 
 ath and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times buti suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny 
 cle no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one 
 ath and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see thatof which i am now speaking 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no verylong period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change themanners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or ofvice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example thelines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reprovingothers and degrading those who disobey 
 cle but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will atonce follow the example set to them and how can he have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them 
 ath let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than when therulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass inany other way the real impossibility or difficulty is of anothersort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once itis surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow 
 cle of what are you speaking 
 ath the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth you might as wellhope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in histemperance this however according to the tradition was in thetimes of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but ifsuch an one either has or ever shall come into being or is nowamong us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his lips and this may be said of power in the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing but in no other way and let what i have been saying beregarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be ourproof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a cityto have good laws but that there is another point of view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are bymoulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state 
 cle let us proceed without delay 
 ath then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may hehear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the stateand the laws 
 cle may he come 
 ath but what form of polity are we going to give the city 
 cle tell us what you mean a little more clearly do you mean someform of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy for wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny 
 ath which of you will first tell me to which of these classes hisown government is to be referred 
 megillus ought i to answer first since i am the elder 
 cle perhaps you should 
 meg and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without morethought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seemsto me to be like a power of our ephors is marvellouslytyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities themost democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is anaristocracy we have also a monarchy which is held for life and issaid by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancientof all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannotprecisely say which form of government the spartan is 
 cle i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feelconfident that the polity of cnosus is any of these 
 ath the reason is my excellent friends that you really havepolities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects andservants of a part of their own state and each of them is named afterthe dominant power they are not polities at all but if states are tobe named after their rulers the true state ought to be called bythe name of the god who rules over wise men 
 cle and who is this god 
 ath may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hopethat i may be better able to answer your question shall i 
 cle by all means 
 ath in the primeval world and a long while before the citiescame into being whose settlements we have described there is saidto have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of whichthe of existing states is a copy 
 cle it will be very necessary to hear about that 
 ath i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced thesubject 
 cle most appropriately and since the tale is to the point youwill do well in giving us the whole story 
 ath i will do as you suggest there is a tradition of the happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and of this the reason is said to have been as knewwhat we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong which reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kingsand rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother tame animals for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race andrule over them in like manner god in his love of mankind placedover us the demons who are a superior race and they with greatcase and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice never the tribes of men happy and united and this tradition whichis true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not godis the ruler have no escape from evils and toils still we must doall that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed inthe days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us to that we must hearken both in private and public life andregulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the veryterm law the distribution of mind but if either a single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures to be filled with them yet retaining none of perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder andthis evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomesthe master either of a state or of an as i wassaying salvation is hopeless and now cleinias we have toconsider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine 
 cle certainly we will 
 ath you are you there are of said to be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly recognized now youmust regard this as a matter of importance for what isto be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point atissue men say that the law ought not to regard either militaryvirtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established form of government this is thought bythem to be the best way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice 
 cle how 
 ath justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i they say the governing power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state 
 cle true 
 ath well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny ordemocracy or any other conquering power does not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by them the first orprincipal object of their laws 
 cle how can they have any other 
 ath and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as by the legislator who calls the laws just 
 cle naturally 
 ath this then is always the mode and fashion in which justiceexists 
 cle certainly if they are correct in their view 
 ath why yes this is one of those false principles of governmentto which we were referring 
 cle which do you mean 
 ath those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought togovern whom did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought togovern their children and the elder the younger and the noble theignoble and there were many other principles if you remember andthey were not always consistent one principle was this very principleof might and we said that pindar considered violence natural andjustified it 
 cle yes i remember 
 ath consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted for thereis a thing which has occurred times without number in states 
 cle what thing 
 ath that when there has been a contest for power those who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their live watchingone another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power andrise up against them now according to our view such governments arenot polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular classes and not for the good of the whole which have such laws are not polities but parties and theirnotions of justice are simply unmeaning i say this because i amgoing to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any otheradvantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm andto him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to himwho bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those who come next in order and when i call therulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not forthe sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon suchservice or ministry depends the well or of the state forthat state in which the law is subject and has no authority iperceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer 
 cle truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age 
 ath why yes every man when he is young has that sort of visiondullest and when he is old keenest 
 cle very true 
 ath and now what is to be the next step may we not suppose thecolonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath friends we say to as the old tradition in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that according to his nature in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end justice always accompanies him and isthe punisher of those who fall short of the divine law to justice hewho would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with allhumility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated bywealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soulhot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide orruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say isleft deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to himothers who are like himself and dances about throwing all thingsinto confusion and many think that he is a great man but in ashort time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve andis utterly destroyed and his family and city with him that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man door think or not do or think 
 cle every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one ofthe followers of god there can be no doubt of that 
 ath then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in hisfollowers one only expressed once for all in the old saying agrees with like with measure measure but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things whichhave now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and notman as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more trueof him and he who would be dear to god must as far as is like him and such as he is wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlikehim and different from him and unjust and the same applies to otherthings and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest andtruest of all for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of allthings and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fitand meet but with the bad man the opposite of this is true forthe bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from onewho is polluted neither good man nor god can without improprietyreceive gifts wherefore the unholy do only waste their much serviceupon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service ismost acceptable to them this is the mark at which we ought to what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them in thefirst place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and thegods of the state honour should be given to the gods below theyshould receive everything in even and of the second choice and illomen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things oflucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightlyhit the mark of piety next to these gods a wise man will doservice to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them nextcomes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have topay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering thatall which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up and that he must do all that he can to minister to in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in hissoul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowedupon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their all his life long he ought never to utter or to have unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice isappointed to watch over all such matters when they are angry and wantto satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may bereasonably expected to be very angry at their death the mostmoderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense noryet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by theformer generation to their parents and let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them andgiving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead doing living after this manner we shall receive our reward from thegods and those who are above us the demons and we shall spendour days for the most part in good hope and how a man ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friendsand and the rites of hospitality taught by the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with aview to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own i say the laws as we proceed with them will persuading and partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and willthus render our state if the gods with us prosperousand happy but of what has to be said and must be said by thelegislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in theform of law would be out of this i think that he may givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he islegislating and then when as far as he is able he has gonethrough all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work oflegislation now what will be the form of such prefaces there may bea difficulty in including or describing them all under a singleform but i think that we may get some notion of them if we canguarantee one thing 
 cle what is that 
 ath i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtueas possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in allhis laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having for thereis no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good or as quickly good as possible the case of the manyproves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness issmooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is sovery short 
 but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but whenyou have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy 
 cle yes and he certainly speaks well 
 ath very true and now let me tell you the effect which thepreceding discourse has had upon me 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we have a little conversation with the say to legislator speak if you know what we ought to sayand do you can surely tell 
 cle of course he can 
 ath did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked for that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went against the laws to thehurt of the state 
 cle that is true 
 ath may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets 
 cle what answer shall we make to him 
 ath that the poet according to the tradition which has everprevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down onthe tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art beingimitative he is often compelled to represent men of oppositedispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than inanother this is not the case in a law the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same thing but one only take an example fromwhat you have just been saying of three kinds of funerals there isone which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is amean and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade mebury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise theextravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money tospend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderatemeans who was himself moderate would praise a moderate you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say amoderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and howmuch unless you are definite you must not suppose that you arespeaking a language that can become law 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but tosay at once do this avoid then holding the penalty interrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner ofsome doctors for of doctors as i may remind you some have agentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest remedies what i mean to say is thatbesides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styleddoctors 
 cle very true 
 ath and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir masters empirically and not according to the natural way oflearning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically to their are aware that there are these two classes of doctors 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patientsin states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about andcure the slaves or wait for them in the ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually or let themtalk about their own individual complaints the slave doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exactknowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is so he relieves the master of the house of the care of hisinvalid slaves but the other doctor who is a freeman attends andpractises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back andgoes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse withthe patient and with his friends and is at once getting informationfrom the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him atlast when he has brought the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attemptsto effect a cure now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and in a trainer is he the better who accomplishes his endsin a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder andinferior 
 cle i should say stranger that the double way is far better 
 ath should you like to see an example of the double and singlemethod in legislation 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath what will be our first law will not the the order of by making regulations for states about births 
 cle he will 
 ath in all states the birth of children goes back to the connectionof marriage 
 cle very true 
 ath and according to the true order the laws relating to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every state 
 cle quite so 
 ath then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form itmay run as man shall marry between the ages of thirty or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine orshall suffer the loss of such and such privileges this would be thesimple law about marriage the double law would run manshall marry between the ages of thirty and consideringthat in a manner the human race naturally partakes of every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for thedesire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in thegrave without a name is only the love of continuance now mankind arecoeval with all time and are ever following and will ever course of time and so they are immortal because they children behind them and partake of immortality in theunity of generation and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself ofthis gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife orchildren is impiety he who obeys the law shall be free and shallpay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when hehas arrived at the age of shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours whichthe young men in the state give to the aged comparing now the twoforms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about anyother they should be double in length even when they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half the length 
 meg the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance withlacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were toask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainlydetermine in favour of the longer and i would have every law madeafter the same pattern if i had to choose but i think thatcleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state whichis going to use these laws 
 cle thank you megillus 
 ath whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is avery foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to beapproved nor is length at all to be regarded of the two forms of lawwhich have been recited the one is not only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning and yetlegislators never appear to have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might use in andforce for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they usethe one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion but employ force pure and simple moreover there is a thirdpoint sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in ourexisting laws 
 cle what is it 
 ath a point arising out of our previous discussion which comesinto my mind in some mysterious way all this time from early dawnuntil noon have we been talking about laws in this charmingretreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them why do i mention this for all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes andovertures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of everyother kind have preludes framed with wonderful care but of thetruer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yetuttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there wasno such thing in nature whereas our present discussion seems to me toimply that there double laws of which we were speaking arenot exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the preludeof the law the arbitrary command which was compared to thecommands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort wasthe law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described byour friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact anexhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse fori imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislatorhas been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to creategoodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reasonof this he might more intelligently receive his is to say the law and therefore in my way of speaking this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of thelaw and i must further proceed to observe that to all his to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble heshould remember how great will be the difference between as they have or have not such preambles as in the casealready given 
 cle the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislatein the form which you advise 
 ath i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that alllaws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at thebeginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makesall the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and greatalike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songsor speeches although they may be natural to all they are notalways necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the in the present instance of the lawgiver 
 cle that i think is most true and now stranger without delay letus return to the argument and as people say in play make a secondand better beginning if you please with the principles which we havebeen laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamblebefore but of which we may now make a preamble and not merelyconsider them to be chance topics of discourse let us that we have a preamble about the honour of the gods and therespect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceedto the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemedby you to be complete and after that you shall go through the lawsthemselves 
 ath i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble about gods and and about parents living or now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the lightof day 
 cle exactly 
 ath after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i thespeaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens asregards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies atthe nature of education these then are the topics which follow nextin order

 book iv 
 
 athenian stranger and now what will this city be i do not mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the original or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a nameto the city but i do want to know what the situationis whether maritime or inland 
 cleinias i should imagine stranger that the city of which weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea 
 ath and are there harbours on the seaboard 
 cle excellent harbours stranger there could not be better 
 ath alas what a prospect and is the surrounding countryproductive or in need of importations 
 cle hardly in need of anything 
 ath and is there any neighbouring state 
 cle none whatever and that is the reason for selecting theplace in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial 
 ath and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain andwood 
 cle like the rest of crete in that 
 ath you mean to say that there is more rock than plain 
 cle exactly 
 ath then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous hadyou been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importingrather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have beenneeded and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance ofmanners but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the seais too near especially if as you say the harbours are so we may be content the sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting inthe souls of men uncertain and unfaithful the stateunfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also toother nations there is a consolation therefore in the countryproducing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness ofthe soil not providing anything in great abundance had there beenabundance there might have been a great export trade and a greatreturn of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has themost fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of justand noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in theprevious discussion 
 cle i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are inthe right 
 ath well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timberfor 
 cle there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not muchcypress and you will find very little or whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships 
 ath these are also natural advantages 
 cle why so 
 ath because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies in what is mischievous 
 cle how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we havebeen speaking 
 ath remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretanlaws that they look to one thing only and this as you bothagreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as theytended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded apart only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them and nowi hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislatewith a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtueonly for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims onlyat that on which some eternal beauty is always attending anddismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit whenseparated from virtue i was saying that the imitation of enemieswas a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as weknow was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants ofattica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no shipsof war as they now have nor was the country filled and therefore they could not readily build them hencethey could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in thisway becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies betterfor them to have lost many times over the seven youths than and stationary troops should have been turned intosailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again tocome running back to their ships or should have fancied that therewas no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for aman throwing away his arms and betaking himself to isnot dishonourable as people say at certain times this is thelanguage of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinarypraise for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the bestpart of the citizens you may learn the evil of such a practice fromhomer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because hedesires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when theachaeans are hard pressed by the gets angry with him andsays 
 who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans maybe accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us for theachaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn intothe sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in thatthe counsel which you give will prove see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhoodof fighting men to be an might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer moreover naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving of it for he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due but howcan a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour 
 cle it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was thesalvation of hellas 
 ath why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread bothamong hellenes and barbarians but megillus and i say rather that thebattle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea thecompletion of the great deliverance and that these battles by landmade the hellenes better whereas the of salamis i may as well put them both them nobetter if i may say so without offence about the battles which helpedto save us and in estimating the goodness of a state we regardboth the situation of the country and the order of the that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but thecontinuance of the best life while we live and that again if i amjot mistaken is remark which has been made already 
 cle yes 
 ath then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation ofstates 
 cle the best by far 
 ath and now let me proceed to another question who are to be thecolonists may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too numerous for the means ofsubsistence for i suppose that you are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any hellene who likes to come and yet i observethat to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina andother parts of hellas tell me then whence do you draw your recruitsin the present enterprise 
 cle they will come from all crete and of other will be most acceptable for as you truly are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which hasthe highest character at the present day is the gortynian and thishas come from gortys in the peloponnesus 
 ath cities find colonization in some respects easier if thecolonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out froma single country either when friends leave friends owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate and there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by asuperior power in war this however which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates adifficulty there is an element of friendship in the community ofrace and language and language and laws and in common templesand rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering from that which they had at home and although the badnessof their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of thecolony who is their legislator finds them troublesome andrebellious on the other hand the conflux of several populationsmight be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make themcombine and pull together as they say of horses is a mostdifficult task and the work of years and yet there is nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation andcolonization 
 cle no doubt but i should like to know why you say so 
 ath my good friend i am afraid that the course of myspeculations is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be noharm and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the sameprinciple applies equally to all human things 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i was going to say that man never legislates but accidentsof all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways theviolence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning governments and changing laws and the power of discasehas often caused innovations in the state when there have beenpestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing during many years any one who sees all this naturallyrushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortallegislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and thepilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be wellsaid and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth of all of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath that god governs all things and that chance and with him in the government of human affairs there a third and less extreme view that art should be there i should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage in having the aid of the art you would agree 
 cle yes 
 ath and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well asto other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the state yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear on the scene 
 cle most true 
 ath in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly forcertain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he wouldthen only require to exercise his art 
 cle certainly 
 ath and all the other artists just now mentioned if they werebidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so 
 cle of course 
 ath and the legislator would do likewise 
 cle i believe that he would 
 ath come legislator we will say to him what are theconditions which you require in a state before you can organize ought he to answer this question shall i give his answer 
 cle yes 
 ath he will me a state which is governed by a tyrant andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick atlearning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have thatquality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them 
 cle i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which thestranger speaks must be temperance 
 ath yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers iscalled prudence but that which is the natural gift of children andanimals of whom some live continently and others incontinently butwhen isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogueof goods i think that you must understand my meaning 
 cle certainly 
 ath then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny 
 cle by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuadehimself of such a monstrous doctrine 
 ath there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is inaccordance with the order of nature 
 cle you would assume as you say a tyrant who was quick at learning having a good memory courageous of anoble nature 
 ath yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happychance brings them together when this has been accomplished godhas done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers and third best for a state in which thereare three the difficulty increases with the increase anddiminishes with the diminution of the number 
 cle you mean to say i suppose that the best government isproduced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and anorderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfectform of government takes place most easily less easily when from anoligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not thatyour meaning 
 ath not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made outof a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out ofsome sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comesoligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such achange because the government is in the hands of a number ofpotentates i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of thetrue sort and that his strength is united with that of the chiefmen of the state and when the ruling element is numerically at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change islikely to be easiest and most rapid 
 cle how i do not understand 
 ath and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times buti suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny 
 cle no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one 
 ath and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see thatof which i am now speaking 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no verylong period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change themanners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or ofvice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example thelines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reprovingothers and degrading those who disobey 
 cle but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will atonce follow the example set to them and how can he have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them 
 ath let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than when therulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass inany other way the real impossibility or difficulty is of anothersort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once itis surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow 
 cle of what are you speaking 
 ath the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth you might as wellhope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in histemperance this however according to the tradition was in thetimes of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but ifsuch an one either has or ever shall come into being or is nowamong us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his lips and this may be said of power in the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing but in no other way and let what i have been saying beregarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be ourproof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a cityto have good laws but that there is another point of view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are bymoulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state 
 cle let us proceed without delay 
 ath then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may hehear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the stateand the laws 
 cle may he come 
 ath but what form of polity are we going to give the city 
 cle tell us what you mean a little more clearly do you mean someform of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy for wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny 
 ath which of you will first tell me to which of these classes hisown government is to be referred 
 megillus ought i to answer first since i am the elder 
 cle perhaps you should 
 meg and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without morethought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seemsto me to be like a power of our ephors is marvellouslytyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities themost democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is anaristocracy we have also a monarchy which is held for life and issaid by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancientof all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannotprecisely say which form of government the spartan is 
 cle i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feelconfident that the polity of cnosus is any of these 
 ath the reason is my excellent friends that you really havepolities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects andservants of a part of their own state and each of them is named afterthe dominant power they are not polities at all but if states are tobe named after their rulers the true state ought to be called bythe name of the god who rules over wise men 
 cle and who is this god 
 ath may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hopethat i may be better able to answer your question shall i 
 cle by all means 
 ath in the primeval world and a long while before the citiescame into being whose settlements we have described there is saidto have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of whichthe of existing states is a copy 
 cle it will be very necessary to hear about that 
 ath i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced thesubject 
 cle most appropriately and since the tale is to the point youwill do well in giving us the whole story 
 ath i will do as you suggest there is a tradition of the happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and of this the reason is said to have been as knewwhat we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong which reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kingsand rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother tame animals for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race andrule over them in like manner god in his love of mankind placedover us the demons who are a superior race and they with greatcase and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice never the tribes of men happy and united and this tradition whichis true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not godis the ruler have no escape from evils and toils still we must doall that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed inthe days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us to that we must hearken both in private and public life andregulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the veryterm law the distribution of mind but if either a single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures to be filled with them yet retaining none of perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder andthis evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomesthe master either of a state or of an as i wassaying salvation is hopeless and now cleinias we have toconsider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine 
 cle certainly we will 
 ath you are you there are of said to be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly recognized now youmust regard this as a matter of importance for what isto be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point atissue men say that the law ought not to regard either militaryvirtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established form of government this is thought bythem to be the best way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice 
 cle how 
 ath justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i they say the governing power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state 
 cle true 
 ath well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny ordemocracy or any other conquering power does not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by them the first orprincipal object of their laws 
 cle how can they have any other 
 ath and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as by the legislator who calls the laws just 
 cle naturally 
 ath this then is always the mode and fashion in which justiceexists 
 cle certainly if they are correct in their view 
 ath why yes this is one of those false principles of governmentto which we were referring 
 cle which do you mean 
 ath those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought togovern whom did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought togovern their children and the elder the younger and the noble theignoble and there were many other principles if you remember andthey were not always consistent one principle was this very principleof might and we said that pindar considered violence natural andjustified it 
 cle yes i remember 
 ath consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted for thereis a thing which has occurred times without number in states 
 cle what thing 
 ath that when there has been a contest for power those who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their live watchingone another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power andrise up against them now according to our view such governments arenot polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular classes and not for the good of the whole which have such laws are not polities but parties and theirnotions of justice are simply unmeaning i say this because i amgoing to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any otheradvantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm andto him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to himwho bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those who come next in order and when i call therulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not forthe sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon suchservice or ministry depends the well or of the state forthat state in which the law is subject and has no authority iperceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer 
 cle truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age 
 ath why yes every man when he is young has that sort of visiondullest and when he is old keenest 
 cle very true 
 ath and now what is to be the next step may we not suppose thecolonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath friends we say to as the old tradition in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that according to his nature in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end justice always accompanies him and isthe punisher of those who fall short of the divine law to justice hewho would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with allhumility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated bywealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soulhot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide orruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say isleft deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to himothers who are like himself and dances about throwing all thingsinto confusion and many think that he is a great man but in ashort time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve andis utterly destroyed and his family and city with him that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man door think or not do or think 
 cle every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one ofthe followers of god there can be no doubt of that 
 ath then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in hisfollowers one only expressed once for all in the old saying agrees with like with measure measure but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things whichhave now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and notman as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more trueof him and he who would be dear to god must as far as is like him and such as he is wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlikehim and different from him and unjust and the same applies to otherthings and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest andtruest of all for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of allthings and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fitand meet but with the bad man the opposite of this is true forthe bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from onewho is polluted neither good man nor god can without improprietyreceive gifts wherefore the unholy do only waste their much serviceupon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service ismost acceptable to them this is the mark at which we ought to what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them in thefirst place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and thegods of the state honour should be given to the gods below theyshould receive everything in even and of the second choice and illomen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things oflucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightlyhit the mark of piety next to these gods a wise man will doservice to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them nextcomes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have topay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering thatall which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up and that he must do all that he can to minister to in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in hissoul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowedupon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their all his life long he ought never to utter or to have unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice isappointed to watch over all such matters when they are angry and wantto satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may bereasonably expected to be very angry at their death the mostmoderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense noryet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by theformer generation to their parents and let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them andgiving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead doing living after this manner we shall receive our reward from thegods and those who are above us the demons and we shall spendour days for the most part in good hope and how a man ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friendsand and the rites of hospitality taught by the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with aview to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own i say the laws as we proceed with them will persuading and partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and willthus render our state if the gods with us prosperousand happy but of what has to be said and must be said by thelegislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in theform of law would be out of this i think that he may givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he islegislating and then when as far as he is able he has gonethrough all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work oflegislation now what will be the form of such prefaces there may bea difficulty in including or describing them all under a singleform but i think that we may get some notion of them if we canguarantee one thing 
 cle what is that 
 ath i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtueas possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in allhis laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having for thereis no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good or as quickly good as possible the case of the manyproves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness issmooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is sovery short 
 but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but whenyou have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy 
 cle yes and he certainly speaks well 
 ath very true and now let me tell you the effect which thepreceding discourse has had upon me 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we have a little conversation with the say to legislator speak if you know what we ought to sayand do you can surely tell 
 cle of course he can 
 ath did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked for that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went against the laws to thehurt of the state 
 cle that is true 
 ath may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets 
 cle what answer shall we make to him 
 ath that the poet according to the tradition which has everprevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down onthe tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art beingimitative he is often compelled to represent men of oppositedispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than inanother this is not the case in a law the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same thing but one only take an example fromwhat you have just been saying of three kinds of funerals there isone which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is amean and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade mebury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise theextravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money tospend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderatemeans who was himself moderate would praise a moderate you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say amoderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and howmuch unless you are definite you must not suppose that you arespeaking a language that can become law 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but tosay at once do this avoid then holding the penalty interrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner ofsome doctors for of doctors as i may remind you some have agentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest remedies what i mean to say is thatbesides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styleddoctors 
 cle very true 
 ath and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir masters empirically and not according to the natural way oflearning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically to their are aware that there are these two classes of doctors 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patientsin states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about andcure the slaves or wait for them in the ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually or let themtalk about their own individual complaints the slave doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exactknowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is so he relieves the master of the house of the care of hisinvalid slaves but the other doctor who is a freeman attends andpractises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back andgoes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse withthe patient and with his friends and is at once getting informationfrom the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him atlast when he has brought the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attemptsto effect a cure now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and in a trainer is he the better who accomplishes his endsin a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder andinferior 
 cle i should say stranger that the double way is far better 
 ath should you like to see an example of the double and singlemethod in legislation 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath what will be our first law will not the the order of by making regulations for states about births 
 cle he will 
 ath in all states the birth of children goes back to the connectionof marriage 
 cle very true 
 ath and according to the true order the laws relating to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every state 
 cle quite so 
 ath then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form itmay run as man shall marry between the ages of thirty or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine orshall suffer the loss of such and such privileges this would be thesimple law about marriage the double law would run manshall marry between the ages of thirty and consideringthat in a manner the human race naturally partakes of every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for thedesire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in thegrave without a name is only the love of continuance now mankind arecoeval with all time and are ever following and will ever course of time and so they are immortal because they children behind them and partake of immortality in theunity of generation and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself ofthis gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife orchildren is impiety he who obeys the law shall be free and shallpay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when hehas arrived at the age of shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours whichthe young men in the state give to the aged comparing now the twoforms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about anyother they should be double in length even when they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half the length 
 meg the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance withlacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were toask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainlydetermine in favour of the longer and i would have every law madeafter the same pattern if i had to choose but i think thatcleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state whichis going to use these laws 
 cle thank you megillus 
 ath whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is avery foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to beapproved nor is length at all to be regarded of the two forms of lawwhich have been recited the one is not only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning and yetlegislators never appear to have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might use in andforce for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they usethe one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion but employ force pure and simple moreover there is a thirdpoint sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in ourexisting laws 
 cle what is it 
 ath a point arising out of our previous discussion which comesinto my mind in some mysterious way all this time from early dawnuntil noon have we been talking about laws in this charmingretreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them why do i mention this for all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes andovertures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of everyother kind have preludes framed with wonderful care but of thetruer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yetuttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there wasno such thing in nature whereas our present discussion seems to me toimply that there double laws of which we were speaking arenot exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the preludeof the law the arbitrary command which was compared to thecommands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort wasthe law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described byour friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact anexhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse fori imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislatorhas been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to creategoodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reasonof this he might more intelligently receive his is to say the law and therefore in my way of speaking this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of thelaw and i must further proceed to observe that to all his to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble heshould remember how great will be the difference between as they have or have not such preambles as in the casealready given 
 cle the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislatein the form which you advise 
 ath i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that alllaws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at thebeginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makesall the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and greatalike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songsor speeches although they may be natural to all they are notalways necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the in the present instance of the lawgiver 
 cle that i think is most true and now stranger without delay letus return to the argument and as people say in play make a secondand better beginning if you please with the principles which we havebeen laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamblebefore but of which we may now make a preamble and not merelyconsider them to be chance topics of discourse let us that we have a preamble about the honour of the gods and therespect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceedto the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemedby you to be complete and after that you shall go through the lawsthemselves 
 ath i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble about gods and and about parents living or now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the lightof day 
 cle exactly 
 ath after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i thespeaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens asregards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies atthe nature of education these then are the topics which follow nextin order

 book v 
 
 athenian stranger listen all ye who have just now heard the lawsabout gods and about our dear all the things whicha man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and mosttruly his own now in every man there are two parts the better andsuperior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves andthe ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who areour masters and those who in order follow them the demons tohonour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no onehonours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing ishonourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word orgift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way to honour her but honours her not at all for example everyman from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to knoweverything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her andhe is very ready to let her do whatever she may like but i mean tosay that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouringher whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only tothe gods again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed andnot himself for the errors which he has committed from time totime and the many and great evils which befell him in is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he isunder the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverseis the fact for he is really injuring her and when disregarding theword and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure thenagain he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her andfills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure tothe end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator approves but gives way before them then by does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her tobe dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields toher and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught sheknows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may bethe greatest of all goods again when any one prefers beauty tovirtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul forsuch a preference implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling toacquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough togive in exchange for virtue in a word i may say that he who does notestimate the base and evil the good and noble according to thestandard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from theone and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not knowthat in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty to grow into the likeness of bad men andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cutoff from them and cleave to and follow after the company of thebad and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such menby nature do and say to one suffering which is not justicebut retribution for justice and the just are noble whereasretribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether aman escape or endure this he is the former case becausehe is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that therest of mankind may be saved 
 speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improvethe inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this ispossible and of all human possessions the soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief when a man has found he should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his life wherefore the soul also is second ornext to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comesthe honour of the body in natural order having determined this wehave next to consider that there is a natural honour of the that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit todecide which are which is the business of the legislator and he isuspect would intimate that they are as is not tobe given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or thetall or to the healthy body although many may think more than to their opposites but the mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal andbase and money and property and distinction all go to the sametune the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defectof them is commonly a cause of slavery and therefore i would nothave any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his order that he may leave them as rich as possible for thepossession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to thestate the condition of youth which is free from flattery and atthe same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the bestand most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with ournature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow letparents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches butthe spirit of reverence we indeed fancy that they will inheritreverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want ofreverence but this quality is not really imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition which only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential a sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heedthat no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young menwill most certainly be devoid of reverence the best way of trainingthe young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice he whohonours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same godsand are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that thegods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and willquicken his seed and he who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances do for him greater and more important than theythemselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirsto him will have their in the intercourse of life andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is byfar the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory ofpeace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws ofhis country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life in his relations to strangers a manshould consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on theprotection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of thestranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers andfor this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning against the stranger and ofoffences committed whether against strangers or against suppliants is the greatest for the god who witnessedto the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a specialmanner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged 
 thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to actabout his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relationto the state and his friends and kindred both in what concernshis own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger we will nowconsider what manner of man he must be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other things which are not matters of of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto be imposed 
 truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first apartaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long aspossible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool neither condition is enviable for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances hebecomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friendsare alive or not he is equally of honour is he whodoes no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not onlydoes no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any thefirst may count as one man the second is worth many men because heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others and yet more highlyto be esteemed is he who with the rulers in correcting thecitizens as far as he shall be proclaimed the great and perfectcitizen and bear away the palm of virtue the same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may beimparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he whoimparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who iswilling yet is not able may be allowed the second place but hewho is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partakein a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue andlet there be no envy for the unenvious nature increases the greatnessof himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame ofno man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better bydefaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of truevirtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies now every man should be valiant but he should also be the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts ofinjustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting anddefending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this asto the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in thefirst place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free will for no man of his own free will would choose topossess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourablepart of himself and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by allmen the most honourable in the soul then which is the mosthonourable part of him no one if he could help would admit orallow to continue the greatest of evils the unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm not getting into a passion like a woman and but upon him who is incapable of reformation and whollyevil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i saythat good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle andpassionate 
 of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men isinnate and which a man is always excusing in himself and nevercorrecting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences forthe lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly ofthe just the good and the honourable and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer himself to the truth but he who would be a great manought to regard not himself or his interests but what is the just act be his own or that of another through asimilar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing thinkthat we know all things and because we will not let others act for usin what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss let every man avoid excess of and condescend tofollow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame tostand in the way there are also minor precepts which are oftenrepeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them andremind himself of them for when a stream is flowing out there shouldbe water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom isdeparting therefore i say that a man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek tobehave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when heseems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him insome of his enterprises still he may ever hope in the case of goodmen that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future godwill lessen and that present evils he will change for the better andas to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will notdoubt that they will be added to them and that they will befortunate such should be hopes and such should be theexhortations with which they admonish one another never losing anopportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves andothers of all these things both in jest and earnest 
 enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching thepractices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons whothey ought severally to be but of human things we have not as yetspoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to and pains and desires are a part of human nature and onthem every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with themost eager interest and therefore we must praise the noblest only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if aman will only taste and not while still in his youth desert foranother he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain during the whole of life and this will be plain if a man hasa true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen but what isa true taste that we have to learn from the pointbeing what is according to nature and what is not according tonature one life must be compared with another the more pleasurablewith the more painful after this desire to havepleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain andwe also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert that we should desire and all these differor do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice in relation to desire and such being the necessary order ofthings we wish for that life in which there are many great andintense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasuresare in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites again do we wish for that in which the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble and the pains exceed and when as i saidbefore there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to beregarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferredby us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by usbecause they exceed in what we dislike all the lives of men may beregarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider whatsort of lives we by nature desire and if we wish for any others isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof the lives which actually exist 
 now what lives are they and how many in which having searched outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites andmaking of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant andthe best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible letus say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rationalanother and the courageous another and the healthful another and tothese four let us oppose four other foolish the intemperate the diseased he who knows the temperate life willdescribe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentlepleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas theintemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains andpleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterlyinsane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness and number and frequency hence one of the two lives isnaturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately and if this is true the inference clearly is that noman is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of menlack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want or both and the same holds of the diseased andhealthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health thepleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds thepleasure now our intention in choosing the lives is not that thepainful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life and weshould say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate andthe wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage thanthe life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and thewise exceeding the foolish and so the one dass of lives exceeds theother class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseasedlives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether ofbody or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him wholives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite 
 enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speakmore correctly outline of them as then in the case of a web or anyother tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the samematerials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger andhaving a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree of a similar manner those who areto hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in eachcase from those who have been but slenderly proven by education letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to themto administer 
 but before all this comes the following or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he hasreceived his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he willdivide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the badbreed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and haveno effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature andill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every otheranimal if he should neglect to purify them now the case of otheranimals is not so are only worth introducing for thesake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highestimportance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicatewhat is proper for each one in the way of purification and of anyother procedure take for example the purification of a many kinds of purification some easier and others more some of them and the best and most difficult of them thelegislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but thelegislator who not being a despot sets up a new government andlaws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may thinkhimself happy if he can complete his work the best kind ofpurification is painful like similar cures in medicine involvingrighteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state but themilder form of purification is as men who havenothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow theirleaders in an attack on the property of the who are thenatural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in afriendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically termed a colony and every legislator shouldcontrive to do this at once our present case however is there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder the circumstances in which we are placed but as when manystreams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountaintorrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care thatthe confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effectthis should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and danger but seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selectionbe supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained touchingevil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we havetested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmostof our ability receive as friends with open arms 
 another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as wewere saying the heraclid colony had and which is also wehave escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for theseare always a source of dangerous contention and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them we musthave recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected in a length of time and such a changecan be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and havingalso many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share withthose who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be theincrease of a desires and not the diminution of his this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order issuitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon anunsound principle the future administration of the country will befull of difficulties that is a danger which as i am saying isescaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised butfreedom from avarice and a sense of this rock our cityshall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty if there are quarrels of long standing among them nolegislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement of the state until they are settled but that they to whomgod has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state asyet free from they should create themselves enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman follyand wickedness 
 how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land in thefirst place the number of the citizens has to be determined and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they will have to beformed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can the number of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and theneighbouring states the territory must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of than thisis not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours andalso to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours when they are wronged after having taken a survey oftheirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limitsof them in fact as well as in theory and now let us proceed tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenientnumber and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of theallotment the houses and the land will be divided in the same way sothat every man may correspond to a lot let the whole number befirst divided into two parts and then into three and the number isfurther capable of being divided into four or five parts or anynumber of parts up to ten every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful to all cities and we are going to take that number whichcontains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions the whole of number has every possible division and thenumber can be divided by exactly divisors and tenof these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnishnumbers for war and peace and for all contracts and taxes and divisions of the land these properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound bylaw to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city with a view to use whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one inrespect of gods and temples which are to be built ineach city and the gods or after whom they are to he be a man of sense he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or anyancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether byapparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to whichmankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus orsome other place and on the strength of which traditions they haveconsecrated oracles and images and altars and temples andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them the least part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he shouldassign to the several districts some god or or hero the distribution of the soil should give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readilysupply their various wants and entertain one another with become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater goodin a state than that the citizens should be known to one another whennot light but darkness and ignorance of each charactersprevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly in every state above all things every man should takeheed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true andsimple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him 
 the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawalof the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being anunusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for thefirst time and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matterwith care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner not the best is the second best perhaps also some one may notapprove this form because he thinks that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who has not despotic power the truth is thatthere are three forms of government the best the second and thethird best which we may just mention and then leave the selection tothe ruler of the settlement following this method in the presentinstance let us speak of the states which are respectively and third in excellence and then we will leave the choiceto cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make asimilar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and which he approvesin his own country 
 the first and highest form of the state and of the government and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancientsaying that friends have all things in common whether there isanywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and childrenand of property in which the private and individual is altogetherbanished from life and things which are by nature private such aseyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see andhear and act in common and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there areunite the city to the all this is possible or not isay that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted in such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or morethan one happy are the men who living after this manner dwellthere and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of thestate and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this the state which we have now in hand when be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace and after that by the grace of god we will complete the thirdone and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of thesecond 
 let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and nottill the land in common since a community of goods goes beyondtheir proposed origin and nurture and education but in making thedistribution let the several possessors feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is theirparent let them tend her more carefully than children do theirmother for she is a goddess and their queen and they are hermortal subjects such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to the gods and of the country and in orderthat the distribution may always remain they ought to considerfurther that the present number of families should be always neither increased nor diminished this may be secured for thewhole city in the following the possessor of a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to bethe heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministeringto the gods the state and the family as well the living members ofit as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance butof his other children if he have more than one he shall give thefemales in marriage according to the law to be hereafter the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children and are disposed to receive them or if there should benone such and particular individuals have too many children maleor female or too few as in the case of all these caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient anddevise a means that the number of houses shall always remainthe same there are many ways of regulating numbers for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on theother hand special care may be taken to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering rebuke to the this waythe object may be attained and if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal preservation of the houses andthere be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of thosewho live together and we are at our wits end there is still the olddevice often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which willpart friends with us and be composed of suitable persons if onthe other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or aplague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than theappointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education if this can be even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity 
 wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to addressus in the following of men cease not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and sameness andagreement as regards number and every good and noble quality all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in thesecond place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which you received in the distribution by buying andselling them to one another for then neither will the god who gaveyou the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which hemay or may not take the lot in the first place the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even athird sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves andthese their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tabletsof for the instruction of posterity moreover theywill set a watch over all these things that they may be which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences both against the law and the god how great is the benefit ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administeredaccordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says butonly a man of experience and good habits for in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity for making money no maneither ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignobleoccupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to afreeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means 
 further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed topossess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment ofhirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons whorequire the use of them wherefore our citizens as we say shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted amongthe rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeysto other embassies or for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a commonhellenic currency if a private person is ever obliged to go him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when hereturns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplusback to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it beconfiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has beenbrought back in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give orreceive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend moneyupon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest that these principles are best any onemay see who compares them with the first principle and intention ofa state the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman isnot what the many declare to be the object of a good that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising should be as great and as rich as possible and shouldpossess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea they imagine to be the real object of legislation at thesame time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desiresto have the city the best and happiest possible but they do not seethat some of these things are possible and some of them areimpossible and he who orders the state will desire what ispossible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts toaccomplish that which is impossible the citizen must indeed behappy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not atleast in the sense in which the many speak of riches for they meanby the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions althoughthe owner of them may quite well be a rogue and if this is true ican never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be be good as well as rich and good in a high degree and rich in ahigh degree at the same time he cannot be some one will ask whynot and we shall acquisitions which come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently are more thandouble those which come from just sources only and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably and on honourablepurposes thus if the one acquires double and spends half theother who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he the am speaking of the saver and not of not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly as i was saying a good man he never is for he who receivesmoney unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor be a rich man if he be also thrifty on the other hand theutterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor whilehe who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just meansonly can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can bevery poor our statement then is true that the very rich are notgood and if they are not good they are not happy but the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and asfriendly as possible to one another and men who are always at lawwith one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done cannever be friends to one another but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are few and slight therefore we say that gold and silverought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort oftrade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meanerkinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches mean soul and body whichwithout gymnastics and without education will never be worthanything and therefore as we have said not once but many care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts forthere are in all three things about which every man has an the interest about money when rightly regarded is the thirdand lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body of all that of the soul and the state which we aredescribing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to this scale but if in any of the laws which have beenordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to healthand temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong wherefore legislator ought often to impress upon himself do i want and do i attain my aim or do i miss themark in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself andfree others from the work of legislation 
 let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we havementioned 
 it would be well that every man should come to the colony having allthings equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man willhave greater possessions than another for many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality in special crises of thestate qualifications of property must be unequal in order thatoffices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each wealth and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so bya law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth hewill receive honours and offices as equally as possible and therewill be no quarrels and disputes to which end there should be fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount of should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by theseor similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass intoanother in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer from being richer the form of law which i should propose asthe natural sequel would be as a state which is desirousof being saved from the greatest of all faction butrather should exist among the citizens neitherextreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productiveof both these evils now the legislator should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor anyone else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lotto be impaired in any case this the legislator gives as a he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much asfour times the amount of this but if a person have yet greaterriches whether he has found them or they have been given to he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back thesurplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of thestate he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if hedisobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half ofthe excess shall belong to the gods and let every possession of everyman with the exception of the lot be publicly registered beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about moneymay be easy and quite simple 
 the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed asnearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easilybe imagined and described then we will divide the city into twelveportions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with acircular wall making the division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point the twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that those which are of good land shall be smaller whilethose of inferior quality shall be larger the number of the lotsshall be and each of them shall be divided into two and everyallotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near thecity the other of land which is at a distance this arrangement shallbe carried out in the following manner the section which is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portionwhich is next farthest and so of the rest moreover in the twosections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soilought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall becompensated by more and less and the legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property asfar as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shallbe a registration of all after this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each godtheir several portions and call the tribes after them and they shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in whichthey divided the country and every man shall have two in the centre of the country and the other at the of the manner of settlement 
 now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither canall things coincide as they are wanted men who will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together and will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and tobeget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allowthemselves to be deprived of gold and other things which thelegislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbidthem and will endure further the situation of the land with thecity in the middle and dwellings round this is as if thelegislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens ofwax there is truth in these objections and therefore every oneshould take to heart what i am going to say once more then thelegislator shall appear and address my friends he will say tous do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree oftruth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which arenot present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at whichhe aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest andthat if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry outthat which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow thelegislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you shouldjoin with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his 
 having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelveparts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished there isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they include or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and areproduced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages and also military ranks andmovements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another nor shouldwe fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all thevessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when weconsider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have ause in respect of all the variations of which they are in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in allsounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straightdirection upwards or downwards as in those which go round and legislator is to consider all these things and to bid thecitizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical no single instrument of youthful education has such mightypower both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the the study of arithmetic above all arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural powers all such things if only the legislator by other lawsand institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from thesouls of men so that they can use them properly and to their owngood will be excellent and suitable instruments of education butif he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead ofwisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in theegyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the generalvulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthylegislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chanceor nature for we must not fail to observe o megillus and there is a difference in places and that some beget better menand others worse and we must legislate accordingly some places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds andviolent heats some by reason of waters or again from the characterof the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls andin all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration and in which the have their appointed lots andare propitious not adverse to the settlers in them to all thesematters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend asfar as man can and frame his laws accordingly and this is whatyou cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country

 athenian stranger listen all ye who have just now heard the lawsabout gods and about our dear all the things whicha man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and mosttruly his own now in every man there are two parts the better andsuperior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves andthe ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who areour masters and those who in order follow them the demons tohonour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no onehonours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing ishonourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word orgift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way to honour her but honours her not at all for example everyman from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to knoweverything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her andhe is very ready to let her do whatever she may like but i mean tosay that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouringher whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only tothe gods again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed andnot himself for the errors which he has committed from time totime and the many and great evils which befell him in is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he isunder the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverseis the fact for he is really injuring her and when disregarding theword and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure thenagain he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her andfills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure tothe end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator approves but gives way before them then by does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her tobe dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields toher and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught sheknows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may bethe greatest of all goods again when any one prefers beauty tovirtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul forsuch a preference implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling toacquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough togive in exchange for virtue in a word i may say that he who does notestimate the base and evil the good and noble according to thestandard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from theone and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not knowthat in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty to grow into the likeness of bad men andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cutoff from them and cleave to and follow after the company of thebad and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such menby nature do and say to one suffering which is not justicebut retribution for justice and the just are noble whereasretribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether aman escape or endure this he is the former case becausehe is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that therest of mankind may be saved 
 speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improvethe inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this ispossible and of all human possessions the soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief when a man has found he should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his life wherefore the soul also is second ornext to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comesthe honour of the body in natural order having determined this wehave next to consider that there is a natural honour of the that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit todecide which are which is the business of the legislator and he isuspect would intimate that they are as is not tobe given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or thetall or to the healthy body although many may think more than to their opposites but the mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal andbase and money and property and distinction all go to the sametune the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defectof them is commonly a cause of slavery and therefore i would nothave any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his order that he may leave them as rich as possible for thepossession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to thestate the condition of youth which is free from flattery and atthe same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the bestand most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with ournature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow letparents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches butthe spirit of reverence we indeed fancy that they will inheritreverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want ofreverence but this quality is not really imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition which only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential a sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heedthat no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young menwill most certainly be devoid of reverence the best way of trainingthe young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice he whohonours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same godsand are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that thegods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and willquicken his seed and he who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances do for him greater and more important than theythemselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirsto him will have their in the intercourse of life andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is byfar the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory ofpeace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws ofhis country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life in his relations to strangers a manshould consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on theprotection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of thestranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers andfor this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning against the stranger and ofoffences committed whether against strangers or against suppliants is the greatest for the god who witnessedto the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a specialmanner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged 
 thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to actabout his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relationto the state and his friends and kindred both in what concernshis own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger we will nowconsider what manner of man he must be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other things which are not matters of of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto be imposed 
 truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first apartaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long aspossible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool neither condition is enviable for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances hebecomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friendsare alive or not he is equally of honour is he whodoes no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not onlydoes no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any thefirst may count as one man the second is worth many men because heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others and yet more highlyto be esteemed is he who with the rulers in correcting thecitizens as far as he shall be proclaimed the great and perfectcitizen and bear away the palm of virtue the same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may beimparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he whoimparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who iswilling yet is not able may be allowed the second place but hewho is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partakein a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue andlet there be no envy for the unenvious nature increases the greatnessof himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame ofno man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better bydefaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of truevirtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies now every man should be valiant but he should also be the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts ofinjustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting anddefending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this asto the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in thefirst place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free will for no man of his own free will would choose topossess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourablepart of himself and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by allmen the most honourable in the soul then which is the mosthonourable part of him no one if he could help would admit orallow to continue the greatest of evils the unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm not getting into a passion like a woman and but upon him who is incapable of reformation and whollyevil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i saythat good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle andpassionate 
 of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men isinnate and which a man is always excusing in himself and nevercorrecting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences forthe lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly ofthe just the good and the honourable and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer himself to the truth but he who would be a great manought to regard not himself or his interests but what is the just act be his own or that of another through asimilar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing thinkthat we know all things and because we will not let others act for usin what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss let every man avoid excess of and condescend tofollow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame tostand in the way there are also minor precepts which are oftenrepeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them andremind himself of them for when a stream is flowing out there shouldbe water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom isdeparting therefore i say that a man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek tobehave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when heseems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him insome of his enterprises still he may ever hope in the case of goodmen that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future godwill lessen and that present evils he will change for the better andas to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will notdoubt that they will be added to them and that they will befortunate such should be hopes and such should be theexhortations with which they admonish one another never losing anopportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves andothers of all these things both in jest and earnest 
 enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching thepractices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons whothey ought severally to be but of human things we have not as yetspoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to and pains and desires are a part of human nature and onthem every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with themost eager interest and therefore we must praise the noblest only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if aman will only taste and not while still in his youth desert foranother he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain during the whole of life and this will be plain if a man hasa true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen but what isa true taste that we have to learn from the pointbeing what is according to nature and what is not according tonature one life must be compared with another the more pleasurablewith the more painful after this desire to havepleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain andwe also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert that we should desire and all these differor do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice in relation to desire and such being the necessary order ofthings we wish for that life in which there are many great andintense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasuresare in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites again do we wish for that in which the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble and the pains exceed and when as i saidbefore there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to beregarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferredby us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by usbecause they exceed in what we dislike all the lives of men may beregarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider whatsort of lives we by nature desire and if we wish for any others isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof the lives which actually exist 
 now what lives are they and how many in which having searched outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites andmaking of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant andthe best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible letus say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rationalanother and the courageous another and the healthful another and tothese four let us oppose four other foolish the intemperate the diseased he who knows the temperate life willdescribe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentlepleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas theintemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains andpleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterlyinsane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness and number and frequency hence one of the two lives isnaturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately and if this is true the inference clearly is that noman is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of menlack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want or both and the same holds of the diseased andhealthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health thepleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds thepleasure now our intention in choosing the lives is not that thepainful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life and weshould say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate andthe wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage thanthe life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and thewise exceeding the foolish and so the one dass of lives exceeds theother class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseasedlives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether ofbody or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him wholives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite 
 enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speakmore correctly outline of them as then in the case of a web or anyother tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the samematerials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger andhaving a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree of a similar manner those who areto hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in eachcase from those who have been but slenderly proven by education letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to themto administer 
 but before all this comes the following or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he hasreceived his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he willdivide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the badbreed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and haveno effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature andill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every otheranimal if he should neglect to purify them now the case of otheranimals is not so are only worth introducing for thesake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highestimportance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicatewhat is proper for each one in the way of purification and of anyother procedure take for example the purification of a many kinds of purification some easier and others more some of them and the best and most difficult of them thelegislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but thelegislator who not being a despot sets up a new government andlaws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may thinkhimself happy if he can complete his work the best kind ofpurification is painful like similar cures in medicine involvingrighteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state but themilder form of purification is as men who havenothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow theirleaders in an attack on the property of the who are thenatural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in afriendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically termed a colony and every legislator shouldcontrive to do this at once our present case however is there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder the circumstances in which we are placed but as when manystreams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountaintorrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care thatthe confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effectthis should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and danger but seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selectionbe supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained touchingevil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we havetested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmostof our ability receive as friends with open arms 
 another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as wewere saying the heraclid colony had and which is also wehave escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for theseare always a source of dangerous contention and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them we musthave recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected in a length of time and such a changecan be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and havingalso many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share withthose who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be theincrease of a desires and not the diminution of his this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order issuitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon anunsound principle the future administration of the country will befull of difficulties that is a danger which as i am saying isescaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised butfreedom from avarice and a sense of this rock our cityshall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty if there are quarrels of long standing among them nolegislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement of the state until they are settled but that they to whomgod has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state asyet free from they should create themselves enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman follyand wickedness 
 how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land in thefirst place the number of the citizens has to be determined and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they will have to beformed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can the number of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and theneighbouring states the territory must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of than thisis not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours andalso to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours when they are wronged after having taken a survey oftheirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limitsof them in fact as well as in theory and now let us proceed tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenientnumber and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of theallotment the houses and the land will be divided in the same way sothat every man may correspond to a lot let the whole number befirst divided into two parts and then into three and the number isfurther capable of being divided into four or five parts or anynumber of parts up to ten every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful to all cities and we are going to take that number whichcontains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions the whole of number has every possible division and thenumber can be divided by exactly divisors and tenof these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnishnumbers for war and peace and for all contracts and taxes and divisions of the land these properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound bylaw to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city with a view to use whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one inrespect of gods and temples which are to be built ineach city and the gods or after whom they are to he be a man of sense he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or anyancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether byapparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to whichmankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus orsome other place and on the strength of which traditions they haveconsecrated oracles and images and altars and temples andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them the least part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he shouldassign to the several districts some god or or hero the distribution of the soil should give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readilysupply their various wants and entertain one another with become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater goodin a state than that the citizens should be known to one another whennot light but darkness and ignorance of each charactersprevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly in every state above all things every man should takeheed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true andsimple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him 
 the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawalof the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being anunusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for thefirst time and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matterwith care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner not the best is the second best perhaps also some one may notapprove this form because he thinks that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who has not despotic power the truth is thatthere are three forms of government the best the second and thethird best which we may just mention and then leave the selection tothe ruler of the settlement following this method in the presentinstance let us speak of the states which are respectively and third in excellence and then we will leave the choiceto cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make asimilar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and which he approvesin his own country 
 the first and highest form of the state and of the government and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancientsaying that friends have all things in common whether there isanywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and childrenand of property in which the private and individual is altogetherbanished from life and things which are by nature private such aseyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see andhear and act in common and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there areunite the city to the all this is possible or not isay that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted in such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or morethan one happy are the men who living after this manner dwellthere and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of thestate and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this the state which we have now in hand when be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace and after that by the grace of god we will complete the thirdone and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of thesecond 
 let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and nottill the land in common since a community of goods goes beyondtheir proposed origin and nurture and education but in making thedistribution let the several possessors feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is theirparent let them tend her more carefully than children do theirmother for she is a goddess and their queen and they are hermortal subjects such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to the gods and of the country and in orderthat the distribution may always remain they ought to considerfurther that the present number of families should be always neither increased nor diminished this may be secured for thewhole city in the following the possessor of a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to bethe heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministeringto the gods the state and the family as well the living members ofit as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance butof his other children if he have more than one he shall give thefemales in marriage according to the law to be hereafter the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children and are disposed to receive them or if there should benone such and particular individuals have too many children maleor female or too few as in the case of all these caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient anddevise a means that the number of houses shall always remainthe same there are many ways of regulating numbers for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on theother hand special care may be taken to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering rebuke to the this waythe object may be attained and if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal preservation of the houses andthere be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of thosewho live together and we are at our wits end there is still the olddevice often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which willpart friends with us and be composed of suitable persons if onthe other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or aplague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than theappointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education if this can be even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity 
 wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to addressus in the following of men cease not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and sameness andagreement as regards number and every good and noble quality all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in thesecond place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which you received in the distribution by buying andselling them to one another for then neither will the god who gaveyou the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which hemay or may not take the lot in the first place the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even athird sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves andthese their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tabletsof for the instruction of posterity moreover theywill set a watch over all these things that they may be which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences both against the law and the god how great is the benefit ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administeredaccordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says butonly a man of experience and good habits for in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity for making money no maneither ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignobleoccupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to afreeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means 
 further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed topossess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment ofhirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons whorequire the use of them wherefore our citizens as we say shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted amongthe rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeysto other embassies or for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a commonhellenic currency if a private person is ever obliged to go him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when hereturns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplusback to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it beconfiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has beenbrought back in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give orreceive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend moneyupon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest that these principles are best any onemay see who compares them with the first principle and intention ofa state the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman isnot what the many declare to be the object of a good that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising should be as great and as rich as possible and shouldpossess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea they imagine to be the real object of legislation at thesame time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desiresto have the city the best and happiest possible but they do not seethat some of these things are possible and some of them areimpossible and he who orders the state will desire what ispossible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts toaccomplish that which is impossible the citizen must indeed behappy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not atleast in the sense in which the many speak of riches for they meanby the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions althoughthe owner of them may quite well be a rogue and if this is true ican never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be be good as well as rich and good in a high degree and rich in ahigh degree at the same time he cannot be some one will ask whynot and we shall acquisitions which come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently are more thandouble those which come from just sources only and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably and on honourablepurposes thus if the one acquires double and spends half theother who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he the am speaking of the saver and not of not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly as i was saying a good man he never is for he who receivesmoney unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor be a rich man if he be also thrifty on the other hand theutterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor whilehe who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just meansonly can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can bevery poor our statement then is true that the very rich are notgood and if they are not good they are not happy but the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and asfriendly as possible to one another and men who are always at lawwith one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done cannever be friends to one another but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are few and slight therefore we say that gold and silverought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort oftrade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meanerkinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches mean soul and body whichwithout gymnastics and without education will never be worthanything and therefore as we have said not once but many care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts forthere are in all three things about which every man has an the interest about money when rightly regarded is the thirdand lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body of all that of the soul and the state which we aredescribing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to this scale but if in any of the laws which have beenordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to healthand temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong wherefore legislator ought often to impress upon himself do i want and do i attain my aim or do i miss themark in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself andfree others from the work of legislation 
 let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we havementioned 
 it would be well that every man should come to the colony having allthings equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man willhave greater possessions than another for many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality in special crises of thestate qualifications of property must be unequal in order thatoffices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each wealth and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so bya law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth hewill receive honours and offices as equally as possible and therewill be no quarrels and disputes to which end there should be fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount of should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by theseor similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass intoanother in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer from being richer the form of law which i should propose asthe natural sequel would be as a state which is desirousof being saved from the greatest of all faction butrather should exist among the citizens neitherextreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productiveof both these evils now the legislator should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor anyone else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lotto be impaired in any case this the legislator gives as a he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much asfour times the amount of this but if a person have yet greaterriches whether he has found them or they have been given to he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back thesurplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of thestate he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if hedisobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half ofthe excess shall belong to the gods and let every possession of everyman with the exception of the lot be publicly registered beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about moneymay be easy and quite simple 
 the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed asnearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easilybe imagined and described then we will divide the city into twelveportions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with acircular wall making the division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point the twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that those which are of good land shall be smaller whilethose of inferior quality shall be larger the number of the lotsshall be and each of them shall be divided into two and everyallotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near thecity the other of land which is at a distance this arrangement shallbe carried out in the following manner the section which is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portionwhich is next farthest and so of the rest moreover in the twosections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soilought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall becompensated by more and less and the legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property asfar as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shallbe a registration of all after this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each godtheir several portions and call the tribes after them and they shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in whichthey divided the country and every man shall have two in the centre of the country and the other at the of the manner of settlement 
 now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither canall things coincide as they are wanted men who will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together and will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and tobeget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allowthemselves to be deprived of gold and other things which thelegislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbidthem and will endure further the situation of the land with thecity in the middle and dwellings round this is as if thelegislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens ofwax there is truth in these objections and therefore every oneshould take to heart what i am going to say once more then thelegislator shall appear and address my friends he will say tous do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree oftruth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which arenot present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at whichhe aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest andthat if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry outthat which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow thelegislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you shouldjoin with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his 
 having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelveparts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished there isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they include or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and areproduced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages and also military ranks andmovements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another nor shouldwe fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all thevessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when weconsider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have ause in respect of all the variations of which they are in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in allsounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straightdirection upwards or downwards as in those which go round and legislator is to consider all these things and to bid thecitizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical no single instrument of youthful education has such mightypower both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the the study of arithmetic above all arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural powers all such things if only the legislator by other lawsand institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from thesouls of men so that they can use them properly and to their owngood will be excellent and suitable instruments of education butif he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead ofwisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in theegyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the generalvulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthylegislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chanceor nature for we must not fail to observe o megillus and there is a difference in places and that some beget better menand others worse and we must legislate accordingly some places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds andviolent heats some by reason of waters or again from the characterof the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls andin all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration and in which the have their appointed lots andare propitious not adverse to the settlers in them to all thesematters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend asfar as man can and frame his laws accordingly and this is whatyou cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country 
 cleinias your words athenian stranger are excellent and i will do as you say

 book vi 
 
 athenian stranger and now having made an end of the preliminarieswe will proceed to the appointment of magistracies 
 cleinias very good 
 ath in the ordering of a state there are two parts first thenumber of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them when they have been established laws again will have tobe provided for each of them suitable in nature and number butbefore electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election of them 
 cle what have you got to say 
 ath this is what i have to say every one can see that althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter yet if city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not onlywill there be no use in having the good only will they beridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evilwill accrue from them 
 cle of course 
 ath then now my friend let us observe what will happen in theconstitution of out intended state in the first place you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial their families should severally have given satisfactory proofof what they are from youth upward until the time of election in thenext place those who are to elect should have been trained inhabits of law and be well educated that they may have a rightjudgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve ordisapprove as they are worthy of either but how can we imaginethat those who are brought together for the first time and arestrangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid makingmistakes in the choice of magistrates 
 cle impossible 
 ath the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn iwill tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as youtell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state onbehalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the inventionof the present romance i certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over the world without a headless monsteris such a hideous thing 
 cle excellent stranger 
 ath yes and i will be as good as my word 
 cle let us by all means do as you propose 
 ath that we will by the grace of god if old age will onlypermit us 
 cle but god will be gracious 
 ath yes and under his guidance let us consider further point 
 cle what is it 
 ath let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis our city is 
 cle what had you in your mind when you said that 
 ath i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws nowa man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition but if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them taketheir part in the public elections of the state i say if thiscould be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way i think that there would be very little danger atthe end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent 
 cle a reasonable supposition 
 ath then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all theother cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish the offices which are first created by them in the bestand surest manner above all this applies to the selection of theguardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with thegreatest care the others are of less importance 
 cle what method can we devise of electing them 
 ath this will be the of the cretans i shall say tothem inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the otherstates they should in common with those who join this a body of in all nineteen of them being takenfrom the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus ofthose latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and youyourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen ofthe new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go thecnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you 
 cle but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in ournew city 
 ath o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are botha long way off but you and likewise the other colonists areconveniently situated as you describe i have been speaking of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under presentcircumstances but in if the city continues to the election be on this wise all who are horse or footsoldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when theywere severally fitted for it shall share in the election ofmagistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes and his name and his tribe andward and at the side he shall write his own name in like one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of notless than thirty days the tablets which are judged to be first tothe number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates whom they prefer and this second selection to thenumber of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walkingthrough the parts of victims and let them choose for magistratesand proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number ofvotes but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them ifwe reflect we shall see that cities which are in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet theymust be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior the best possible for as the proverb says a good beginning ishalf the business and to have begun well is praised by all and inmy opinion is a great deal more than half the business and hasnever been praised by any one enough 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished there is only oneproposal which i have to offer and that is one which under ourcircumstances is both necessary and expedient 
 cle what is it 
 ath i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and are no other than the colonizing state well i know that manycolonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents butin early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even ifthere come a time later when the tie is broken still while he isin want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them hisonly natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling alreadyexists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city andthere is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towardscnosus and i repeat what i was there is no harm inrepeating a good the cnosians should take a common interestin all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest andbest of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred andlet there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves these i their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe appointed according to law and that when they are appointed theyshould undergo a scrutiny when this has been effected the cnosiansshall return home and the new city do the best she can for her ownpreservation and happiness i would have the now andin all future time chosen to fulfil the following the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of theregisters in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens ofthe first class three allowed to the second two to the third anda single mina to the fourth and if any one despising the laws forthe sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not beenregistered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and lethim be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate and let any one who will indict him on the charge ofloving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw and if he be cast let him lose his share of the publicpossessions and when there is any public distribution let him havenothing but his original lot and let him be written down acondemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any onewho pleases can read about his onces the guardian of the law shallnot hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when heis sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only andupon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy years of age if he live so long 
 these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign tothem their further duties and now we may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers for generals have to be elected andthese again must have their ministers commanders and colonels ofhorse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightlycalled by their popular name of brigadiers the guardians of the lawshall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and aselection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare or have been of the age for military service and if one who isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oaththat he is better and propose him and whichever of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and thethree who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointedgenerals and superintendents of military affairs after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law and let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals and the voting and decision shall take place in the sameway until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians ofthe law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitableto the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry bythemselves and in a third division all the rest of the army allare to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse butthe brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry the hoplites let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals but captains of light troops or archers or any otherdivision of the army shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves there only remains the appointment of officers of shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the the election and the of other candidates shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all thehorse disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but ifthe dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall decide 
 the council shall consist of x members will be aconvenient number for if we divide the whole number intofour parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each all the citizens shall select candidates from the firstclass they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shallbe duly fined when the candidates have been selected some oneshall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day andon the following day candidates shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner and under the same conditions as on theprevious day and on the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class at which every one may if he likes vote and thethree first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth andlowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of thisclass who does not vote shall not be punished on the fourth daycandidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shallsuffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing tovote but he who is of the first or second class if he does notvote shall be who is of the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is ofthe first class quadruple on the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shallchoose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the firstpenalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes theyshall choose of them by lot who shall undergo are to form the council for the year 
 the mode of election which has been described is in a mean betweenmonarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always toobserve for servants and masters never can be friends nor good andbad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges for tounequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality citiesare filled with seditions the old saying that equality makesfriendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity andconfusion as to what sort of equality is meant for there are twoequalities which are called by the same name but are in reality inmany ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may beintroduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in thedistribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight andnumber which regulates and apportions them but there is anotherequality of a better and higher kind which is not so easilyrecognized this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails butlittle that little however is the source of the greatest good toindividuals and states for it gives to the greater more and to theinferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less andto either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue andeducation and this is justice and is ever the true principle ofstates at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded and any other city which may behereafter founded to this the legislator should to theinterests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people butto justice always which as i was saying the distribution of naturalequality among unequals in each case but there are times at whichevery state is compelled to use the words just equal in asecondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strictrule of justice and this is the reason why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of thepeople and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and begthat they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supremejustice and therefore although we are compelled to use bothequalities we should use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom as possible 
 thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state actwhich would endure and be saved but as a ship sailing on the seahas to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailingon a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidiousassaults and therefore from morning to night and from night tomorning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers withwatchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetualsuccession now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy moreover the greater number of thesenators will have to be left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns at their own homes they will therefore have tobe arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months andfurnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month theirbusiness is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes to them whether to give information or to put one of thosequestions to which when asked by other cities a city should give ananswer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive ananswer or again when there is a likelihood of internal are always liable to happen in some form or other they will ifthey can prevent their occurring or if they have already lose time in making them known to the city and healing the also this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways to have the control of their assemblies and of thedissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary all this isto be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state during oneportion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions 
 thus will the city be fairly ordered and now who is to have thesuperintendence of the country and what shall be the that the whole city and the entire country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses andbuildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacreddomains and temples and the like 
 cle to be sure there ought

 after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the electionof wardens of the agora and of the city the wardens of the countrywere sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three andwill divide the twelve parts of the city into three like theformer they shall have care of the ways and of the different highroads which lead out of the country into the city and of thebuildings that they may be all made according to of thewaters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to being taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city thesealso should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of thepublic interest let every man propose as warden of the city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has beengiven on them and the number is reduced to the six who have thegreatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lotthree out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to the laws laid down for them next let thewardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first andsecond class five in number ten are to be first elected and outof the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of thewardens of the when they have undergone a scrutiny areto be declared magistrates every one shall vote for every one and hewho will not vote if he be informed against before the be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and secondclass and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their names at the assembly the third and fourthclass shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without afine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present inconsequence of some urgent necessity the wardens of the agora shallobserve the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have thecharge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and theyshall see that no one injures anything and punish him who stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be acitizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundreddrachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up todouble that amount and let the wardens of the city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines in their own department andlet them impose fines by their own department and let them imposefines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens of the agora 
 in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of musicand gymnastic two kinds of the one kind the business willbe education of the other the superintendence of contests inspeaking of education the law means to speak of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of thegoing to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and inspeaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics andof music these again are divided into two classes the one havingto do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in musicthere shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the another who shall judge of choral song first of all we mustchoose directors for the choruses of boys and men and they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for ourother musical arrangements one director will be enough for thechoruses and he should be not less than forty years of age onedirector will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and togive judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less thanthirty years of age the director and manager of the choruses shall beelected after the following any persons who commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined ifthey do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of theirfault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled theelector shall propose as director some one who understands he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those whosay that he has ten are to be elected by vote and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the chorusesfor a year according to law and in like manner the competitor whowins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for thatyear and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to thejudges in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests ofhorses and of men these shall be selected from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away withimpunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen previously and they must also have the voteand approval of the examiners but if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the samemanner and undergo a similar scrutiny 
 there remains the minister of the education of youth male andfemale he too will rule according to law one such minister will besufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfullybegotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or theother he who is elected and he who is the elector should considerthat of all the great offices of state this is the greatest forthe first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on itsmaturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild andtame and also of men man as we say is a tame or civilizedanimal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost savage of earthly creatures wherefore the legislator ought notto allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidentalmatter in the first place he who would be rightly provident aboutthem should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all thecitizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and superintendent to this end all themagistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shallgo to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendentof education and he who has the greatest number of votes after hehas undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been his electors with the exception of the guardians of hold office for five years and in the sixth year letanother be chosen in like manner to fill his office 
 if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more thanthirty days before his term of office expires let those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the same manner asbefore and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let therelations both on the and side who are residingat home including cousins appoint another guardian within tendays or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so 
 a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city andagain if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations hewill never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judgeswill not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad the point indispute between the parties should be made clear and time anddeliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear updoubts for this reason he who goes to law with another should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questionsat issue and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactorydecision let him have recourse to another court and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit 
 now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as achoice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge ofsome things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which heis determining a suit regarding then the judges also asmagistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they areto be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit let thatbe the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves choosing certain persons by agreement and let there betwo other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accusesanother of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other forpublic causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate thecommon interests and we must not forget to mention how the judges areto be qualified and who they are to be in the first place let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes oneagainst another for the third time and let this be composed the officers of state as well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period when the new year is about to commence inthe month following after the summer solstice on the last day but oneof the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be choosing in each office him who seems to them to bethe best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be heldin the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner those who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined theinferior courts and shall give their vote openly the councillors andother magistrates who have elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may bepresent who pleases if one man charges another with havingintentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty thejudges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the partywho brought the suit 
 in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought toparticipate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in thedecision such causes ought to originate with the people and theought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of themshall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are notable to come to an agreement themselves the council shall chooseone of the two proposed and in private suits too as far as ispossible all should have a share for he who has no share in theadministration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state at all and for this reason there shall be a court of law inevery tribe and the judges shall be chosen by shall givetheir decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to final judgment shall rest with that court which as we been established in the most incorruptible form of which humanthings admit this shall be the court established for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours orof the tribes 
 thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices asuperficial sketch has been given of them in which some things havebeen told and others omitted for the right place of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits under their several be at the end of the body of us then expect themat the end hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices perfect unity and exactness extendingto the whole and every particular of political be attained to the full until the discussion shall have abeginning middle and end and is complete in every part atpresent we have reached the election of magistrates and this may beregarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded and now thereneed no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation 
 cle i like what you have said i particularly likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to theend of the former one 
 ath thus far then the old rational pastime has gone offwell 
 cle you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit 
 ath perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreedabout a certain thing 
 cle about what thing 
 ath you know the endless labour which painters expend upon are always putting in or taking out colours or whateverbe the term which artists employ they seem as if they would nevercease touching up their works which are always being made brighterand more beautiful 
 cle i know something of these matters from report although ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art 
 ath no matter we may make use of the that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always improve as time went you not see that being amortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is leftimperfect through the defect of the artist and who will furtherbrighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will lastbut a short time 
 cle true 
 ath and is not the aim of the legislator similar first he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible exactness inthe second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial ofhis decrees will he not find omissions do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted which some one coming after him must the constitution and the order of government is not to to improve in the state which he has established 
 cle assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one woulddesire 
 ath and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this byword or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he shouldfinish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete 
 cle by all means 
 ath and is not this what you and i have to do at the presentmoment 
 cle what have we to do 
 ath as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians ofthe law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they ascompared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate forthem but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the lawbut legislators themselves as far as this is possible 
 cle certainly if we can 
 ath at any rate we must do our best 
 cle of course 
 ath we will say to friends and saviours of our laws inlaying down any law there are many particulars which we shall this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmostto describe what is important and will give an outline which youshall fill up and i will explain on what principle you are to and cleinias and i have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us andbecome our disciples and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview there was one main point about which we were a energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition ofthe virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study orhabit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion this applies equally to men and women old and of all should always be such as i have described anything whichmay be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he mustbe and endure all such trials rather than accept another form ofgovernment which is likely to make men worse these are ouroriginal principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to and blame the those which have not this power ofmaking the citizen better but embrace those which have and withgladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a differentkind 
 let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with theirfoundation in religion and we must first return to the entire number had and has a great many convenientdivisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe whole being correctly formed by x x also has them and not only is the whole numberdivisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible bytwelve now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift ofheaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of theuniverse every city has a guiding and sacred principle given bynature but in some the division or distribution has been more rightthan in others and has been more sacred and fortunate in ouropinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easycorrection for if turning to the dividend we deduct twofamilies the defect in the division is cured and the truth of thismay be easily proved when we have leisure but for the to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide thestate and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god letus give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the assemblies forthe tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions thefirst in honour of the gods and divine things and the second topromote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is andevery sort of good fellowship with one another for people must beacquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far aspossible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake andwith this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seennaked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion nottransgressing the rules of modesty 
 the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulatorsof these games and they together with the guardians of the law willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said wherethere are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave outsomething and the annual officers who have experience and knowwhat is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year byyear until such enactments and provisions are sufficientlydetermined a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances ifextending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be deadthen the several officers shall refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians of the law and correct them untilall is perfect and from that time there shall be no more they shall establish and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally gave them and of which they are never ifthey can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakesthem the magistrates must be called into counsel and the wholepeople and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if theyare all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they arenot agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shallprevail as the law ordains 
 whenever any one over years of age having seen and beenseen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connectionwhich is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of him marry if he be still under the age of let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable andappropriate for as cleinias says every law should have a suitableprelude 
 cle you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season 
 ath i thank you we will say to him who is born of good son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage norspecially to desire a rich one but if other things are to honour inferiors and with them to form be for the benefit of the city and of the families which areunited for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed and he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all hisactions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance let there be one word concerning all manshall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself but after that which is most beneficial to the state forsomehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand in disposition and hence there arise in most states the veryresults which we least desire to happen now to add to the law anexpress provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into therich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage withthe quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in whichthe maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberergod receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult occurs wherefore also the law must let alone such matters butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing theequability of their disposition to be of more importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn asideby reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law 
 let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let usremember what was said a man should cling toimmortality and leave behind him children to be theservants of god in his place for ever all this and much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage but if aman will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among and is still unmarried at years of him pay a yearly who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and thefourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he whodoes not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum whichthe treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing him be answerable and give an account of the money at hisaudit he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish anyone let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall bepronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen of themarriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for theinstruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will beless likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient tothem on account of property and he who obeys this law will do a nobleaction but he who will not obey and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest or more than a mina or a mina if he be of thethird or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which isgiven or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let thetreasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the treasurers of here were to exact the money orpay the fine themselves 
 the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree thatby a grandfather in the second degree and in the third by brothers who have the same father but if there arenone of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid inlike manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority what are to be the rites beforemarriages or any other sacred acts relating either to or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters andhe who follows their advice may be satisfied touching the marriagefestival they shall assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of both families and a like number of members of thefamily of either sex and no man shall spend more than his meanswill allow he who is of the richest class may spend a whois of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as thecensus of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedientto the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song drunkenness is alwaysimproper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine andpeculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business ofmarriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or nightheaven will give them increase who can say moreover they oughtnot to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quietand compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions and beside himself both in body and soul wherefore drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind hence during the whole year and all his life long andespecially while he is begetting children ought to take care andnot intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involvesinsolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begetschildren in every way inferior and especially on the day and night ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things for the is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if itmeet with proper respect from each individual he who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his children going away from his fatherand mother for in friendships there must be some degree of desire inorder to cement and bind together diversities of character butexcessive intercourse not having the desire which is created bytime insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother their own and themselves go as to a colony anddwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shallbeget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from onegeneration to another and worshipping the gods according to law forever 
 in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will bemost convenient there is no difficulty either in understanding oracquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty inwhat relates to slaves and the reason is that we speak about themin a way which is right and which is not right for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practiceabout them 
 megillus i do not understand stranger what you mean 
 ath i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots amongthe lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the mostcontroverted and disputed about some approving and some condemningit there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among theheracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about thethessalian penestae looking at these and the like examples whatought we to do concerning property in slaves i made a remark inpassing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning fromyou it was know that all would agree that we should have thebest and most attached slaves whom we can get for many a man hasfound his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their masters andtheir whole tales are well known 
 meg to be sure 
 ath but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterlycorrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them and thewisest of our poets speaking of zeus says 
 zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom theday of slavery persons have got these two different notions of slaves intheir of them utterly distrust their servants and as ifthey were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and maketheir souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they others do just the opposite 
 meg true 
 cle then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeingthat there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by theirowners 
 ath well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesomeanimal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely tobecome so when you attempt to introduce the necessary and freeman and master 
 cle that is obvious 
 ath he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shownby the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak the same the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian they are called a man who considers all this is fairly at aloss two remedies alone remain to to have the slaves of thesame country nor if possible speaking the same language in this waythey will more easily be held in subjection secondly we shouldtend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet moreout of respect to ourselves and the right treatment of slaves is tobehave properly to them and to do to them if possible even morejustice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally andgenuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered inhis dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves isundefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds ofvirtue in them and this may be truly said of every master andtyrant and of every other having authority in relation to hisinferiors slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and notadmonished as if they were freemen which will only make themconceited the language used to a servant ought always to be that of acommand and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males is a foolish way which many people have of setting uptheir slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their masters 
 cle true 
 ath now that each of the citizens is provided as far aspossible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings 
 cle very good 
 ath the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to betaken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of also of the temples and walls these cleinias were matters whichproperly came before the marriages but as we are only talking thereis no objection to changing the order if however our plan oflegislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede themarriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to theregulations about marriage but at present we are only describingthese matters in a general outline 
 cle quite true 
 ath the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the wholecity built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and forthe sake of purity near the temples are to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded asmost holy partly because they have to do with the holy things andpartly because they are the of holy gods and inthem will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital offenses may fitly take place as to the i agree with sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt todisinter them there is a poetical saying which is finelyexpressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not ofearth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young menannually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off theenemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory and then that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting mento run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them toimagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight but that when they are protected by walls and gates thenthey may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and didnot know that true repose comes from labour and that disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal oftrouble but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall havingall the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets the form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easilyguarded will be infinitely better for security until the originalbuilding is completed these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend thework and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in allthat relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness andnot allow a private person to encroach upon any public property eitherby buildings or excavations further they ought to take care that therains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters whichmay have to be administered either within or without the city theguardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show to be necessary and supply any other points inwhich the law may be deficient and now that these matters and thebuildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places ofinstruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the order of legislation 
 cle by all means 
 ath assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode oflife during the year after marriage before children are born willfollow next in order in what way bride and bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter notat all easy for us to determine there have been many difficultiesalready but this will be the greatest of them and the mostdisagreeable to the many still i cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true cleinias 
 cle certainly 
 ath he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct ofstates while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to takecare of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as theyplease and that there is no necessity of order in all things he isay who gives up the control of their private lives and supposesthat they will conform to law in their common and public life ismaking a great mistake why have i made this remark why because i amgoing to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables just as they did before marriage this was a singularitywhen first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of somewar or other similar danger which caused the passing of the which would be likely to occur in places and intimes of pressure but when men had once tried and been accustomedto a common table experience showed that the institution greatlyconduced to security and in some such manner the custom of havingcommon tables arose among you 
 cle likely enough 
 ath i said that there may have been singularity and danger inimposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the samedifficulty there is however another institution which is thenatural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existedanywhere but at present it does not the institution of which i amabout to speak is not easily described or executed and would belike the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say orperforming any other impossible and useless feat 
 cle what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation 
 ath you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time that whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good but thatwhich is disordered or is often the ruin of that whichis and at this point the argument is now waiting forwith you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as isaid a and admirable institution but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law they have no similar institutionof public tables in the light of day and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their mean the female been leftwithout regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax amongyou which might have been far better if they had been only regulatedby law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportionas nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice asimportant the careful consideration of this matter and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind thatno man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities in which they have never been established at how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts tocompel women to show in public how much they eat and drink there isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence for women areaccustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be fartoo much for the legislator and therefore as i said before inmost places they will not endure to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may andif we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you willconsent to listen that this institution is good and proper but ifyou had rather not i will refrain 
 cle there is nothing which we should both of us like than to hear what you have to say 
 ath very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject of law 
 cle true 
 ath then let us return once more to what we were saying at man should understand that the human race either had nobeginning at all and will never have an end but always will be andhas been or that it began an immense while ago 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and have there not been constitutions and destructions ofstates and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and may we not suppose that vines appeared which hadpreviously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter andher daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and these existed animals took to devouring each other as theydo still 
 cle true 
 ath again the practice of men sacrificing one another still existsamong many nations while on the other hand we hear of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey andsimilar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these theyabstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and mightnot stain the altars of the gods with blood for in those days men aresaid to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of alllifeless things but abstaining from all living things 
 cle such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true 
 ath some one might say to us what is the drift of all this 
 cle a very pertinent question stranger 
 ath and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw thenatural inference 
 cle proceed 
 ath i see that among men all things depend upon three wants anddesires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led bythem or the opposite if wrongly now these are eating and begin at animal has a natural desire for them andis violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all thecorresponding the third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust whichkindles in men every species of wantonness and madness and thesethree disorders we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of fear and law and right reason turning them away fromthat which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses andthe gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase andinflux 
 but to marriage let us speak of the birth of after their birth of their nurture and education in the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables whether such associations are to beconfined to men or extended to women also we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer view of them and we may thendetermine what previous institutions are required and will have toprecede them as i said before we shall see them more in detail andshall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them 
 cle very true 
 ath let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken forhereafter there may be need of them 
 cle what do you bid us keep in mind 
 ath that which we comprehended under the three drinking thirdly the excitement of love 
 cle we shall be sure to remember stranger 
 ath very good then let us now proceed to marriage and teachpersons in what way they shall beget children threatening them ifthey disobey with the terrors of the law 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children whichthey can now all men who are associated any action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind to what they are doing butwhen they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail whereforelet the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children and the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are notyet born and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch matters and let them in whatever number large or small andat whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day inthe temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and beingthere assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they man or woman of those who are begetting the ordinances given at the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage isfruitful but if any continue without children up to this time letthem take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit any dispute arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and abide by their permission and appointment the women whopreside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give overtheir folly and error if they persist let the women go and tellthe guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them but ifthey too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before thepeople and let them write up their names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus writtenup if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any onewho pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulationshold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad orreceive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she inlike manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict and if when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording to the law a man or woman have connection with anotherman or woman who are still begetting children let the samepenalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga family and when the time for procreation has passed let the manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of is to now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly theenactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are enactments having been passed let them be carried into every man the first year is the beginning of life and the timeof birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned and near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when theydepart life let them be erased the limit of marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the aman from thirty to years and let a woman hold officeat forty and a man at thirty years let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need tomake use of her in military service let the time of service beafter she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each
