 socrates glaucon 
 and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view 
 i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened 
 i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider 
 and what is the next question he asked 
 surely i said the one which follows next in order inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our state 
 and how can we rightly answer that question 
 whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state let them be our guardians 
 very good 
 neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes 
 there can be no question of that 
 and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are unable as with a eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons i ask simply blind 
 truly he replied they are much in that condition 
 and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also know the very truth of each thing 
 there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect 
 suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences 
 by all means 
 in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained we must come to an understanding about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in the state 
 what do you mean 
 let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption 
 agreed 
 and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition 
 true 
 and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality which they should also possess 
 what quality 
 truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth 
 yes that may be safely affirmed of them 
 may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections 
 right he said 
 and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth 
 how can there be 
 can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood 
 never 
 the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him lies desire all truth 
 assuredly 
 but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel 
 true 
 he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasure i mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one 
 that is most certain 
 such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place in his character 
 very true 
 another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered 
 what is that 
 there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human 
 most true he replied 
 then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence think much of human life 
 he cannot 
 or can such an one account death fearful 
 no indeed 
 then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy 
 certainly not 
 or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean or a boaster or a he i say ever be unjust or hard in his dealings 
 impossible 
 then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical 
 true 
 there is another point which should be remarked 
 what point 
 whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress 
 certainly not 
 and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he not be an empty vessel 
 that is certain 
 labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation yes 
 then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory 
 certainly 
 and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion 
 undoubtedly 
 and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion 
 to proportion 
 then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything 
 certainly 
 well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have a full and perfect participation of being 
 they are absolutely necessary he replied 
 and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred 
 the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study 
 and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to these only you will entrust the state 
 socrates adeimantus 
 here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring for any one of us might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol 
 well and do you think that those who say so are wrong 
 i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion 
 hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right 
 then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them 
 you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable 
 yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all accustomed i suppose 
 i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having first chained up the noble senses with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the hands into their own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other people like or possibility of this union of authority with the art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true pilot be regarded will he not be called by them a prater a a 
 of course said adeimantus 
 then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you understand already 
 certainly 
 then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary 
 i will 
 say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them and 
 precisely so he said 
 for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which opinion i agreed 
 yes 
 and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained 
 true 
 then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other 
 by all means 
 and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the gentle and noble nature truth as you will remember was his leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy 
 yes that was said 
 well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance with present notions of him 
 certainly he said 
 and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till then will he cease from his travail 
 nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him 
 and will the love of a lie be any part of a nature will he not utterly hate a lie 
 he will 
 and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads 
 impossible 
 justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow after 
 true he replied 
 neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts and you objected that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher 
 exactly 
 and we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling i am speaking of those who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak 
 what are these corruptions he said 
 i will see if i can explain them to you every one will admit that a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men 
 rare indeed 
 and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures 
 what causes 
 in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and the rest of them every one of which praise worthy qualities and this is a most singular circumstance destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them 
 that is very singular he replied 
 then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength rank and great connections in the state you understand the sort of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect 
 i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about them 
 grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer appear strange to you 
 and how am i to do so he asked 
 why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than what is not 
 very true 
 there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is greater 
 certainly 
 and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are become bad do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil 
 there i think that you are right 
 and our philosopher follows the same is like a plant which having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power do you really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of are not the public who say these things the greatest of all sophists and do they not educate to perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own hearts 
 when is this accomplished he said 
 when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young heart as they say leap within him will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion or will he be carried away by the stream will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do and as they are such will he be 
 yes socrates necessity will compel him 
 and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been mentioned 
 what is that 
 the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their words are powerless 
 indeed they do and in right good earnest 
 now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest 
 none he replied 
 no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say 
 i quite assent he replied 
 then let me crave your assent also to a further observation 
 what are you going to say 
 why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is their wisdom i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator 
 indeed he would 
 and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing for when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is not obliged the necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good did you ever hear any of them which were not 
 no nor am i likely to hear 
 you recognise the truth of what i have been saying then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind 
 certainly not 
 then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher 
 impossible 
 and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world 
 they must 
 and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them 
 that is evident 
 then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end and remember what we were saying of him that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence these were admitted by us to be the true gifts 
 yes 
 will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones 
 certainly he said 
 and his friends and will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes 
 no question 
 falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he will one day possess 
 that often happens he said 
 and what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall proper youth will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride 
 to be sure he will 
 now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will be easily induced to listen 
 far otherwise 
 and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions 
 there can be no doubt of it 
 and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher 
 impossible 
 then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may if he be divert him from philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other goods of life 
 we were quite right 
 thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states 
 that is most true he said 
 and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment 
 that is certainly what people say 
 yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts for although philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts and many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts is not this unavoidable 
 yes 
 are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his daughter who is left poor and desolate 
 a most exact parallel 
 what will be the issue of such marriages will they not be vile and bastard 
 there can be no question of it 
 and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom 
 no doubt he said 
 then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant perchance some noble and person detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but kept him away from politics my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way he is like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and with bright hopes 
 yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs 
 a great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself 
 the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained the injustice of the charges against her has been there anything more which you wish to say 
 nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her 
 not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and receives another character but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or institutions are but human and now i know that you are going to ask what that state is 
 no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another question whether it is the state of which we are the founders and inventors or some other 
 yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before that some living authority would always be required in the state having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws 
 that was said he replied 
 yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy 
 what is there remaining 
 the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is the good as men say 
 still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be complete 
 i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit 
 in what manner 
 at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off in after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they never light up again 
 but what ought to be their course 
 just the opposite in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another 
 how truly in earnest you are socrates he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of all 
 do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state of existence 
 you are speaking of a time which is not very near 
 rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having a natural unity but a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did 
 no indeed 
 no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society 
 they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak 
 and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely inspired d with a true love of true philosophy that either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries am i not right 
 quite right 
 if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will be whenever the muse of philosophy is queen there is no impossibility in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves 
 my opinion agrees with yours he said 
 but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude 
 i should imagine not he replied 
 o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed if they view him in this new light they will surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain who can be at enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy nay let me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind 
 i quite agree with you he said 
 and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this 
 it is most unbecoming 
 for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform himself can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse 
 impossible 
 and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will suffer from detraction 
 of course 
 and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue 
 anything but unskilful 
 and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will they be angry with philosophy will they disbelieve us when we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern 
 they will not be angry if they understand he said but how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking 
 they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface this is no easy task but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them and every other legislator they will have nothing to do either with individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made a clean surface 
 they will be very right he said 
 having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution 
 no doubt 
 and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and thus they will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men homer calls the form and likeness of god 
 very true he said 
 and one feature they will erase and another they will put in they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god 
 indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture 
 and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard 
 much calmer if there is any sense in them 
 why where can they still find any ground for objection will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being 
 they would not be so unreasonable 
 or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest good 
 neither can they doubt this 
 but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was or will they prefer those whom we have rejected 
 surely not 
 then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our imaginary state ever be realised 
 i think that they will be less angry 
 shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot refuse to come to terms 
 by all means he said 
 then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected will any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers 
 surely no man he said 
 and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this 
 who indeed 
 but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous 
 yes one is enough 
 the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them 
 certainly 
 and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or impossibility 
 i think not 
 but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only possible is assuredly for the best 
 we have 
 and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not impossible 
 very good 
 and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies 
 certainly 
 i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to discuss them all the same the women and children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning we were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure like gold tried in the fire was to be made a ruler and to receive honours and rewards in life and after death this was the sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen 
 i perfectly remember he said 
 yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a philosopher 
 yes he said let that be affirmed 
 and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in shreds and patches 
 what do you mean he said 
 you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons who possess them and are at the same time and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes out of them 
 very true he said 
 on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil 
 quite true 
 and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or command 
 certainly he said 
 and will they be a class which is rarely found 
 yes indeed 
 then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises 
 yes he said you are quite right in testing him but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge 
 you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom 
 indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more 
 and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them 
 to what do you refer 
 we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it is for you to say 
 yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure of truth 
 but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further 
 not an uncommon case when people are indolent 
 yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and of the laws 
 true 
 the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling 
 what he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues 
 yes i said there is and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished picture should satisfy us when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy 
 a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge 
 nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have of been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness 
 assuredly not 
 you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge 
 yes 
 and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good 
 how ridiculous 
 yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous 
 most true he said 
 and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good 
 certainly 
 and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same 
 true 
 there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is involved 
 there can be none 
 further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one 
 very true he said 
 of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance 
 certainly not he said 
 i am sure i said that he who does not know now the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them 
 that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours 
 and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be perfectly ordered 
 of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different from either 
 aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters 
 true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others and never telling his own 
 well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know 
 not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion 
 and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of them blind you would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road 
 very true 
 and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will tell you of brightness and beauty 
 glaucon socrates 
 still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we shall be satisfied 
 yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help fearing that i shall fall and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon me no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for me but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wished to hear otherwise not 
 by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent 
 i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a false account although i have no intention of deceiving you 
 yes we will take all the care that we can proceed 
 yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other times 
 what 
 the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other things which we describe and define to all of them many is applied 
 true he said 
 and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each 
 very true 
 the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not seen 
 exactly 
 and what is the organ with which we see the visible things 
 the sight he said 
 and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense 
 true 
 but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived 
 no i never have he said 
 then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard 
 nothing of the sort 
 no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition 
 certainly not 
 but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen 
 how do you mean 
 sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible 
 of what nature are you speaking 
 of that which you term light i replied 
 true he said 
 noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing 
 nay he said the reverse of ignoble 
 and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear 
 you mean the sun as you and all mankind say 
 may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows 
 how 
 neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun 
 no 
 yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun 
 by far the most like 
 and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun 
 exactly 
 then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight 
 true he said 
 and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and the things of mind 
 will you be a little more explicit he said 
 why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision in them 
 very true 
 but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see clearly and there is sight in them 
 certainly 
 and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence 
 just so 
 now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour yet higher 
 what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good 
 god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point of view 
 in what point of view 
 you would say would you not that the sun is only the author of visibility in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he himself is not generation 
 certainly 
 in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power 
 glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how amazing 
 yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter my fancies 
 and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun 
 yes i said there is a great deal more 
 then omit nothing however slight 
 i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omitted 
 you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible i do not say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz may i suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind 
 i have 
 now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like do you understand 
 yes i understand 
 imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made 
 very good 
 would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge 
 most undoubtedly 
 next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is to be divided 
 in what manner 
 thus there are two subdivisions in the lower or which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves 
 i do not quite understand your meaning he said 
 then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminary remarks you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and everybody are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner at their conclusion 
 yes he said i know 
 and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen with the eye of the mind 
 that is true 
 and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and therefore a higher value 
 i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and the sister arts 
 and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends 
 i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason and the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason 
 you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the answering to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction to the third and perception of shadows to the let there be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth 
 i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement

 book vii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets 
 i see 
 and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent 
 you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners 
 like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave 
 true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads 
 and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows 
 yes he said 
 and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them 
 very true 
 and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow 
 no question he replied 
 to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images 
 that is certain 
 and now look again and see what will naturally follow it the prisoners are released and disabused of their error at first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him 
 far truer 
 and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him 
 true he now 
 and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent and held fast until he s forced into the presence of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities 
 not all in a moment he said 
 he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day 
 certainly 
 last of he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate him as he is 
 certainly 
 he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold 
 clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him 
 and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change and pity them 
 certainly he would 
 and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before and which followed after and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them would he not say with homer 
 better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their manner 
 yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner 
 imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness 
 to be sure he said 
 and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable would he not be ridiculous men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender and they would put him to death 
 no question he said 
 this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous argument the is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your desire i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly god knows but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed 
 i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you 
 moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted 
 yes very natural 
 and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice 
 anything but surprising he replied 
 any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den 
 that he said is a very just distinction 
 but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes 
 they undoubtedly say this he replied 
 whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being or in other words of the good 
 very true 
 and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth 
 yes he said such an art may be presumed 
 and whereas the other virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness 
 very true he said 
 but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below if i say they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now 
 very likely 
 yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest 
 very true he replied 
 then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not 
 but is not this unjust he said ought we to give them a worse life when they might have a better 
 you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state 
 true he said i had forgotten 
 observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have them being they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the double duty wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark when you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst 
 quite true he replied 
 and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light 
 impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present rulers of state 
 yes my friend i said and there lies the point you must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may have a state for only in the state which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of life whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs poor and hungering after the own private advantage thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state 
 most true he replied 
 and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy do you know of any other 
 indeed i do not he said 
 and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task for if they are there will be rival lovers and they will fight 
 no question 
 who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics 
 they are the men and i will choose them he replied 
 and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods 
 by all means he replied 
 the process i said is not the turning over of an but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophy 
 quite so 
 and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change 
 certainly 
 what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes 
 yes that was said 
 then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality 
 what quality 
 usefulness in war 
 yes if possible 
 there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not 
 just so 
 there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption 
 true 
 then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover no 
 but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme 
 music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking 
 you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly was nothing of the kind but what branch of knowledge is there my dear glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us 
 undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also excluded what remains 
 well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we shall have to take something which is not special but of universal application 
 what may that be 
 a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education 
 what is that 
 the little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them 
 yes 
 then the art of war partakes of them 
 to the sure 
 then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number and if that is true what sort of general must he have been 
 i should say a very strange one if this was as you say 
 can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic 
 certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all 
 i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this study 
 what is your notion 
 it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being 
 will you explain your meaning he said 
 i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them 
 explain he said 
 i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded 
 you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade 
 no i said that is not at all my meaning 
 then what is your meaning 
 when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite an illustration will make my meaning clearer here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a middle finger 
 very good 
 you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point 
 what is it 
 each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same in these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger 
 true 
 and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence 
 there is not he said 
 but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers can sight adequately perceive them and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness or softness or hardness and so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft 
 you are quite right he said 
 and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft what again is the meaning of light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light 
 yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained 
 yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two 
 true 
 and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different 
 certainly 
 and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one 
 true 
 the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner they were not distinguished 
 yes 
 whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused 
 very true 
 was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great and what is small 
 exactly so 
 and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible 
 most true 
 this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not 
 i understand he said and agree with you 
 and to which class do unity and number belong 
 i do not know he replied 
 think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being 
 and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude 
 yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number 
 certainly 
 and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number 
 yes 
 and they appear to lead the mind towards truth 
 yes in a very remarkable manner 
 then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician 
 that is true 
 and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher 
 certainly 
 then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal men of our state to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like merchants or with a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being 
 that is excellent he said 
 yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper 
 how do you mean 
 i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions 
 that is very true 
 now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable indivisible what would they answer 
 they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realised in thought 
 then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth 
 yes that is a marked characteristic of it 
 and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been 
 very true he said 
 and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as difficult 
 you will not 
 and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up 
 i agree 
 let this then be made one of our subjects of education and next shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us 
 you mean geometry 
 exactly so 
 clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician 
 yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold 
 true he said 
 then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it does not concern us 
 yes that is what we assert 
 yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians 
 how so 
 they have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science 
 certainly he said 
 then must not a further admission be made 
 what admission 
 that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient 
 that he replied may be readily allowed and is true 
 then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down 
 nothing will be more likely to have such an effect 
 then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry moreover the science has indirect effects which are not small 
 of what kind he said 
 there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not 
 yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them 
 then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study 
 let us do so he replied 
 and suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say 
 i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor 
 i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them and therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive 
 i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf 
 then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences 
 what was the mistake he said 
 after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have followed 
 that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects 
 why yes i said and for two reasons in the first place no government patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they have a director but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to him that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light 
 yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them but i do not clearly understand the change in the order first you began with a geometry of plane surfaces 
 yes i said 
 and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward 
 yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids 
 true he said 
 then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth 
 the right order he replied and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your own spirit for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another 
 every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to me 
 and what then would you say 
 i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards 
 what do you mean he asked 
 you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes and you are very likely right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back 
 i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke still i should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking 
 i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true figure now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight 
 true he replied 
 the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion 
 no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous 
 and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth 
 i quite agree though i never thought of this before 
 then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use 
 that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers 
 yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value but can you tell me of any other suitable study 
 no he said not without thinking 
 motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine which may be left to wiser persons 
 but where are the two 
 there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named 
 and what may that be 
 the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister sciences as the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them 
 yes he replied 
 but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object 
 what is that 
 there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did in astronomy for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same thing happens the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain 
 yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same either party setting their ears before their understanding 
 you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony for they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain to is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not 
 that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge 
 a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit useless very true he said 
 now when all these studies reach the point of and connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in them 
 i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work 
 what do you mean i said the prelude or what do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician 
 assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning 
 but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them 
 neither can this be supposed 
 and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic this is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself and so with dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible 
 exactly he said 
 then this is the progress which you call dialectic 
 true 
 but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water which are divine and are the shadows of true existence not shadows of images cast by a light of fire which compared with the sun is only an image this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described 
 i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet from another point of view is harder still to deny this however is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and again and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest 
 dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth according to my notion whether what i told you would or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like reality of that i am confident 
 doubtless he replied 
 but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences 
 of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last 
 and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them for when a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science 
 impossible he said 
 then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing custom terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was called understanding but why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider 
 why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness 
 at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make a proportion 
 as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion 
 and as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of shadows but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been 
 as far as i understand he said i agree 
 and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing and he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence will you admit so much 
 yes he said how can i deny it 
 and you would say the same of the conception of the good 
 until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world below and has his final quietus 
 in all that i should most certainly agree with you 
 and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters 
 certainly not 
 then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions 
 yes he said you and i together will make it 
 dialectic then as you will agree is the of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go 
 i agree he said 
 but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered 
 yes clearly 
 you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before 
 certainly he said 
 the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education 
 and what are these 
 such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the own and is not shared with the body 
 very true he replied 
 further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him 
 certainly he said he must have natural gifts 
 the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards 
 what do you mean 
 in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry i mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness 
 certainly he said 
 and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected 
 to be sure 
 and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard 
 that is very true he said 
 all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present 
 that would not be creditable 
 certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am equally ridiculous 
 in what respect 
 i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much excitement for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement 
 indeed i was listening and did not think so 
 but i who am the speaker felt that i was and now let me remind you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary toil 
 of course 
 and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of education 
 why not 
 because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind 
 very true 
 then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent 
 that is a very rational notion he said 
 do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them 
 yes i remember 
 the same practice may be followed i said in all these things labours lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number 
 at what age 
 at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected 
 certainly he replied 
 after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being 
 yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root 
 yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical 
 i agree with you he said 
 these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most of this comprehension and who are more steadfast in their learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great caution is required 
 why great caution 
 do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced 
 what evil he said 
 the students of the art are filled with lawlessness 
 quite true he said 
 do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case or will you make allowance for them 
 in what way make allowance 
 i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has many flatterers when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again when he knows or shall i guess for you 
 if you please 
 then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter 
 he will 
 but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations 
 well all that is very probable but how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy 
 in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them 
 that is true 
 there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers 
 true 
 now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before 
 impossible 
 and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires 
 he cannot 
 and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it 
 unquestionably 
 now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have described and also as i was just now saying most excusable 
 yes he said and i may add pitiable 
 therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic 
 certainly 
 there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them 
 yes he said there is nothing which they like better 
 and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world 
 too true he said 
 but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit 
 very true he said 
 and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance aspirant or intruder 
 very true 
 suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough 
 would you say six or four years he asked 
 say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch 
 and how long is this stage of their lives to last 
 fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the pythian oracle consent as but if not as in any case blessed and divine 
 you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty 
 yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go 
 there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things like the men 
 well i said and you would agree would you not that what has been said about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city 
 how will they proceed 
 they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most 
 yes that will be the best way and i think socrates that you have very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into being 
 enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its image there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him 
 there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said

 book vii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets 
 i see 
 and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent 
 you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners 
 like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave 
 true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads 
 and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows 
 yes he said 
 and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them 
 very true 
 and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow 
 no question he replied 
 to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images 
 that is certain 
 and now look again and see what will naturally follow it the prisoners are released and disabused of their error at first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him 
 far truer 
 and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him 
 true he now 
 and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent and held fast until he s forced into the presence of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities 
 not all in a moment he said 
 he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day 
 certainly 
 last of he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate him as he is 
 certainly 
 he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold 
 clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him 
 and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change and pity them 
 certainly he would 
 and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before and which followed after and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them would he not say with homer 
 better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their manner 
 yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner 
 imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness 
 to be sure he said 
 and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable would he not be ridiculous men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender and they would put him to death 
 no question he said 
 this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous argument the is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your desire i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly god knows but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed 
 i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you 
 moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted 
 yes very natural 
 and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice 
 anything but surprising he replied 
 any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den 
 that he said is a very just distinction 
 but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes 
 they undoubtedly say this he replied 
 whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being or in other words of the good 
 very true 
 and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth 
 yes he said such an art may be presumed 
 and whereas the other virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness 
 very true he said 
 but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below if i say they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now 
 very likely 
 yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest 
 very true he replied 
 then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not 
 but is not this unjust he said ought we to give them a worse life when they might have a better 
 you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state 
 true he said i had forgotten 
 observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have them being they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the double duty wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark when you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst 
 quite true he replied 
 and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light 
 impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present rulers of state 
 yes my friend i said and there lies the point you must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may have a state for only in the state which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of life whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs poor and hungering after the own private advantage thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state 
 most true he replied 
 and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy do you know of any other 
 indeed i do not he said 
 and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task for if they are there will be rival lovers and they will fight 
 no question 
 who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics 
 they are the men and i will choose them he replied 
 and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods 
 by all means he replied 
 the process i said is not the turning over of an but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophy 
 quite so 
 and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change 
 certainly 
 what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes 
 yes that was said 
 then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality 
 what quality 
 usefulness in war 
 yes if possible 
 there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not 
 just so 
 there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption 
 true 
 then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover no 
 but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme 
 music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking 
 you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly was nothing of the kind but what branch of knowledge is there my dear glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us 
 undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also excluded what remains 
 well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we shall have to take something which is not special but of universal application 
 what may that be 
 a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education 
 what is that 
 the little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them 
 yes 
 then the art of war partakes of them 
 to the sure 
 then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number and if that is true what sort of general must he have been 
 i should say a very strange one if this was as you say 
 can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic 
 certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all 
 i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this study 
 what is your notion 
 it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being 
 will you explain your meaning he said 
 i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them 
 explain he said 
 i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded 
 you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade 
 no i said that is not at all my meaning 
 then what is your meaning 
 when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite an illustration will make my meaning clearer here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a middle finger 
 very good 
 you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point 
 what is it 
 each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same in these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger 
 true 
 and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence 
 there is not he said 
 but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers can sight adequately perceive them and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness or softness or hardness and so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft 
 you are quite right he said 
 and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft what again is the meaning of light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light 
 yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained 
 yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two 
 true 
 and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different 
 certainly 
 and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one 
 true 
 the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner they were not distinguished 
 yes 
 whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused 
 very true 
 was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great and what is small 
 exactly so 
 and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible 
 most true 
 this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not 
 i understand he said and agree with you 
 and to which class do unity and number belong 
 i do not know he replied 
 think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being 
 and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude 
 yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number 
 certainly 
 and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number 
 yes 
 and they appear to lead the mind towards truth 
 yes in a very remarkable manner 
 then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician 
 that is true 
 and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher 
 certainly 
 then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal men of our state to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like merchants or with a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being 
 that is excellent he said 
 yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper 
 how do you mean 
 i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions 
 that is very true 
 now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable indivisible what would they answer 
 they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realised in thought 
 then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth 
 yes that is a marked characteristic of it 
 and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been 
 very true he said 
 and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as difficult 
 you will not 
 and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up 
 i agree 
 let this then be made one of our subjects of education and next shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us 
 you mean geometry 
 exactly so 
 clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician 
 yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold 
 true he said 
 then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it does not concern us 
 yes that is what we assert 
 yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians 
 how so 
 they have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science 
 certainly he said 
 then must not a further admission be made 
 what admission 
 that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient 
 that he replied may be readily allowed and is true 
 then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down 
 nothing will be more likely to have such an effect 
 then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry moreover the science has indirect effects which are not small 
 of what kind he said 
 there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not 
 yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them 
 then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study 
 let us do so he replied 
 and suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say 
 i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor 
 i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them and therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive 
 i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf 
 then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences 
 what was the mistake he said 
 after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have followed 
 that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects 
 why yes i said and for two reasons in the first place no government patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they have a director but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to him that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light 
 yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them but i do not clearly understand the change in the order first you began with a geometry of plane surfaces 
 yes i said 
 and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward 
 yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids 
 true he said 
 then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth 
 the right order he replied and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your own spirit for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another 
 every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to me 
 and what then would you say 
 i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards 
 what do you mean he asked 
 you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes and you are very likely right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back 
 i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke still i should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking 
 i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true figure now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight 
 true he replied 
 the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion 
 no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous 
 and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth 
 i quite agree though i never thought of this before 
 then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use 
 that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers 
 yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value but can you tell me of any other suitable study 
 no he said not without thinking 
 motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine which may be left to wiser persons 
 but where are the two 
 there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named 
 and what may that be 
 the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister sciences as the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them 
 yes he replied 
 but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object 
 what is that 
 there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did in astronomy for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same thing happens the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain 
 yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same either party setting their ears before their understanding 
 you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony for they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain to is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not 
 that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge 
 a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit useless very true he said 
 now when all these studies reach the point of and connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in them 
 i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work 
 what do you mean i said the prelude or what do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician 
 assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning 
 but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them 
 neither can this be supposed 
 and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic this is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself and so with dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible 
 exactly he said 
 then this is the progress which you call dialectic 
 true 
 but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water which are divine and are the shadows of true existence not shadows of images cast by a light of fire which compared with the sun is only an image this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described 
 i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet from another point of view is harder still to deny this however is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and again and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest 
 dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth according to my notion whether what i told you would or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like reality of that i am confident 
 doubtless he replied 
 but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences 
 of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last 
 and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them for when a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science 
 impossible he said 
 then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing custom terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was called understanding but why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider 
 why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness 
 at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make a proportion 
 as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion 
 and as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of shadows but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been 
 as far as i understand he said i agree 
 and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing and he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence will you admit so much 
 yes he said how can i deny it 
 and you would say the same of the conception of the good 
 until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world below and has his final quietus 
 in all that i should most certainly agree with you 
 and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters 
 certainly not 
 then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions 
 yes he said you and i together will make it 
 dialectic then as you will agree is the of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go 
 i agree he said 
 but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered 
 yes clearly 
 you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before 
 certainly he said 
 the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education 
 and what are these 
 such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the own and is not shared with the body 
 very true he replied 
 further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him 
 certainly he said he must have natural gifts 
 the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards 
 what do you mean 
 in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry i mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness 
 certainly he said 
 and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected 
 to be sure 
 and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard 
 that is very true he said 
 all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present 
 that would not be creditable 
 certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am equally ridiculous 
 in what respect 
 i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much excitement for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement 
 indeed i was listening and did not think so 
 but i who am the speaker felt that i was and now let me remind you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary toil 
 of course 
 and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of education 
 why not 
 because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind 
 very true 
 then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent 
 that is a very rational notion he said 
 do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them 
 yes i remember 
 the same practice may be followed i said in all these things labours lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number 
 at what age 
 at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected 
 certainly he replied 
 after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being 
 yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root 
 yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical 
 i agree with you he said 
 these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most of this comprehension and who are more steadfast in their learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great caution is required 
 why great caution 
 do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced 
 what evil he said 
 the students of the art are filled with lawlessness 
 quite true he said 
 do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case or will you make allowance for them 
 in what way make allowance 
 i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has many flatterers when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again when he knows or shall i guess for you 
 if you please 
 then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter 
 he will 
 but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations 
 well all that is very probable but how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy 
 in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them 
 that is true 
 there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers 
 true 
 now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before 
 impossible 
 and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires 
 he cannot 
 and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it 
 unquestionably 
 now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have described and also as i was just now saying most excusable 
 yes he said and i may add pitiable 
 therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic 
 certainly 
 there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them 
 yes he said there is nothing which they like better 
 and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world 
 too true he said 
 but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit 
 very true he said 
 and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance aspirant or intruder 
 very true 
 suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough 
 would you say six or four years he asked 
 say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch 
 and how long is this stage of their lives to last 
 fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the pythian oracle consent as but if not as in any case blessed and divine 
 you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty 
 yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go 
 there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things like the men 
 well i said and you would agree would you not that what has been said about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city 
 how will they proceed 
 they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most 
 yes that will be the best way and i think socrates that you have very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into being 
 enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its image there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him 
 there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said

 book viii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings 
 that replied glaucon has been acknowledged 
 yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed 
 yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state 
 true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path 
 there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived 
 your recollection i said is most exact 
 then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then 
 yes if i can i will i said 
 i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking 
 that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state i do not know do you of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians 
 yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them 
 do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them 
 yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters 
 then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five 
 certainly 
 him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described 
 we have 
 then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice the enquiry will then be completed and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice 
 certainly he replied we must do as you say 
 shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision 
 that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable 
 first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved 
 very true he said 
 in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest 
 how would they address us 
 after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in existences pass over a short space and in ones over a long space but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great x and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i e omitting fractions the side of which is five x x each of them being less by one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five and a hundred cubes of three x now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us the muses first by music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like are of gold and silver and brass and iron and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us 
 yes and we may assume that they answer truly 
 why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely 
 and what do the muses say next 
 when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them 
 i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change 
 and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy 
 very true 
 such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities 
 true he said 
 in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former 
 true 
 but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar 
 yes 
 yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please 
 that is most true he said 
 and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music 
 undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil 
 why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element 
 assuredly he said 
 such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour 
 very true he replied 
 now what man answers to this form of did he come into being and what is he like 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon 
 perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different 
 in what respects 
 he should have more of and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase 
 yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy 
 such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost his best guardian 
 who was that said adeimantus 
 philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life 
 good he said 
 such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state 
 exactly 
 his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a grave father who dwells in an city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble 
 and how does the son come into being 
 the character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too adding all the other complaints about her own which women are so fond of rehearsing 
 yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves 
 and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the are honoured and applauded the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious 
 you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly 
 then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character 
 we have 
 next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says 
 is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state 
 by all means 
 i believe that oligarchy follows next in order 
 and what manner of government do you term oligarchy 
 a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it 
 i understand he replied 
 ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises 
 yes 
 well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other 
 how 
 the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law 
 yes indeed 
 and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money 
 likely enough 
 and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls 
 true 
 and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured 
 clearly 
 and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected 
 that is obvious 
 and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 
 they do so 
 they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work 
 very true 
 and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established 
 yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking 
 first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot 
 you mean that they would shipwreck 
 yes and is not this true of the government of anything 
 i should imagine so 
 except a city or would you include a city 
 nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all 
 this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy 
 clearly 
 and here is another defect which is quite as bad 
 what defect 
 the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another 
 that surely is at least as bad 
 another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes 
 how discreditable 
 and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one does that look well 
 anything but well 
 there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable 
 what evil 
 a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature 
 yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state 
 the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty 
 true 
 but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift 
 as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift 
 may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive 
 just so socrates 
 and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed 
 most true he said 
 clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors 
 clearly 
 well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers 
 yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler 
 and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force 
 certainly we may be so bold 
 the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education and an evil constitution of the state 
 true 
 such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils 
 very likely 
 then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state 
 by all means 
 does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise 
 how 
 a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him 
 nothing more likely 
 and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion from his throne humbled by poverty he takes to and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar 
 most true he replied 
 and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it 
 of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one 
 and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth 
 yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came 
 let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them 
 very good 
 first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth 
 certainly 
 also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable 
 true 
 he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a true image of the state which he represents 
 he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state 
 you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said 
 i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 
 excellent i said yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life 
 true 
 do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries 
 where must i look 
 you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan 
 aye 
 it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions 
 to be sure 
 yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own 
 yes and they will be strong in him too 
 the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones 
 true 
 for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him 
 i should expect so 
 and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money 
 very true 
 can we any longer doubt then that the miser and answers to the oligarchical state 
 there can be no doubt 
 next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgement 
 that he said is our method 
 well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise is it not on this wise the good at which such a state alms is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable 
 what then 
 the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance 
 to be sure 
 there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded 
 that is tolerably clear 
 and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary 
 yes often 
 and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution 
 that is true 
 on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state 
 yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain 
 the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a use of his own property or by another remedy 
 what other 
 one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state 
 yes they will be greatly lessened 
 at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain 
 very true 
 they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue 
 yes quite as indifferent 
 such is the state of affairs which prevails among them and often rulers and their subjects may come in one way whether on a pilgrimage or a march as or aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much 
 yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking 
 and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause 
 yes surely 
 and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot 
 yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw 
 and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they for as the government is such will be the man 
 clearly he said 
 in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes 
 tis said so he replied 
 and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases 
 clearly 
 then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures 
 there will 
 this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states 
 yes 
 yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government 
 why 
 because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state 
 he will be sure to have patterns enough 
 and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful 
 for the moment yes 
 and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares 
 yes he replied many and many a one 
 see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the friend 
 yes she is of a noble spirit 
 these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike 
 we know her well 
 consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being 
 very good he said 
 is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits 
 exactly 
 and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary 
 obviously 
 would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures 
 i should 
 are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us and they are rightly so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it 
 true 
 we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary 
 we are not 
 and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary 
 yes certainly 
 suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them 
 very good 
 will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class 
 that is what i should suppose 
 the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life 
 yes 
 but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health 
 certainly 
 and the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary 
 very true 
 may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production 
 certainly 
 and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good 
 true 
 and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical 
 very true 
 again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process 
 what is the process 
 when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical 
 inevitably 
 and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike 
 certainly 
 and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself 
 it must be so 
 and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young soul and order is restored 
 yes he said that sometimes happens 
 and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous 
 yes he said that is apt to be the way 
 they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him 
 very true 
 at length they seize upon the citadel of the young soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels 
 none better 
 false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place 
 they are certain to do so 
 and so the young man returns into the country of the and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border 
 yes with a will 
 and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures 
 yes he said the change in him is visible enough 
 after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally 
 very true he said 
 neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another 
 yes he said that is the way with him 
 yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on 
 yes he replied he is all liberty and equality 
 yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him 
 just so 
 let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man 
 let that be his place he said 
 last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider 
 quite true he said 
 say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident 
 clearly 
 and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort 
 how 
 the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right 
 yes 
 and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of was also the ruin of oligarchy 
 true 
 and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution 
 what good 
 freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell 
 yes the saying is in mouth 
 i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny 
 how so 
 when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs 
 yes he replied a very common occurrence 
 yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public now in such a state can liberty have any limit 
 certainly not 
 by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them 
 how do you mean 
 i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either 
 yes he said that is the way 
 and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young 
 quite true he said 
 the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other 
 why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips 
 that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the as the proverb says are as good as their and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty 
 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe you and i have dreamed the same thing 
 and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them 
 yes he said i know it too well 
 such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny 
 glorious indeed he said but what is the next step 
 the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government 
 true 
 the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery 
 yes the natural order 
 and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty 
 as we might expect 
 that however was not as i believe your rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both 
 just so he replied 
 well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings 
 a very just comparison 
 these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible 
 yes by all means he said 
 then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state 
 that is true 
 and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified 
 how so 
 because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones 
 very true he said 
 then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass 
 what is that 
 they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be the richest 
 naturally so 
 they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones 
 why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little 
 and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them 
 that is pretty much the case he said 
 the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy 
 true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey 
 and do they not share i said do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves 
 why yes he said to that extent the people do share 
 and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can 
 what else can they do 
 and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy true 
 and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them 
 that is exactly the truth 
 then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another 
 true 
 the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness 
 yes that is their way 
 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector 
 yes that is quite clear 
 how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus 
 what tale 
 the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf did you never hear it 
 oh yes 
 and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant 
 inevitably 
 this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich 
 the same 
 after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown 
 that is clear 
 and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him 
 yes he said that is their usual way 
 then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the friend as they say be lost to them 
 exactly 
 the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves 
 very true 
 and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus 
 by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 
 and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again 
 but if he is caught he dies 
 of course 
 and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute 
 no doubt he said 
 and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated 
 yes he said let us consider that 
 at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one 
 of course he said 
 but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader 
 to be sure 
 has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him clearly 
 and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war 
 he must 
 now he begins to grow unpopular 
 a necessary result 
 then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done 
 yes that may be expected 
 and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything 
 he cannot 
 and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state 
 yes he said and a rare purgation 
 yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse 
 if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself 
 what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all 
 yes that is the alternative 
 and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require 
 certainly 
 and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them 
 they will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays them 
 by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land 
 yes he said there are 
 but will he not desire to get them on the spot 
 how do you mean 
 he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his bodyguard 
 to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all 
 what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends 
 yes he said they are quite of his sort 
 yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him 
 of course 
 verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian 
 why so 
 why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 
 tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions 
 yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets 
 and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny 
 yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us 
 but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies 
 very true 
 moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further 
 true 
 but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and army of his 
 if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people 
 and when these fail 
 why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his estate 
 you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions 
 yes he said they cannot help themselves 
 but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates 
 by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong 
 why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence what beat his father if he opposes him 
 yes he will having first disarmed him 
 then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery 
 true he said 
 very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny 
 yes quite enough he said

 book viii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings 
 that replied glaucon has been acknowledged 
 yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed 
 yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state 
 true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path 
 there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived 
 your recollection i said is most exact 
 then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then 
 yes if i can i will i said 
 i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking 
 that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state i do not know do you of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians 
 yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them 
 do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them 
 yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters 
 then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five 
 certainly 
 him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described 
 we have 
 then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice the enquiry will then be completed and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice 
 certainly he replied we must do as you say 
 shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision 
 that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable 
 first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved 
 very true he said 
 in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest 
 how would they address us 
 after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in existences pass over a short space and in ones over a long space but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great x and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i e omitting fractions the side of which is five x x each of them being less by one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five and a hundred cubes of three x now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us the muses first by music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like are of gold and silver and brass and iron and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us 
 yes and we may assume that they answer truly 
 why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely 
 and what do the muses say next 
 when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them 
 i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change 
 and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy 
 very true 
 such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities 
 true he said 
 in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former 
 true 
 but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar 
 yes 
 yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please 
 that is most true he said 
 and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music 
 undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil 
 why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element 
 assuredly he said 
 such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour 
 very true he replied 
 now what man answers to this form of did he come into being and what is he like 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon 
 perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different 
 in what respects 
 he should have more of and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase 
 yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy 
 such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost his best guardian 
 who was that said adeimantus 
 philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life 
 good he said 
 such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state 
 exactly 
 his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a grave father who dwells in an city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble 
 and how does the son come into being 
 the character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too adding all the other complaints about her own which women are so fond of rehearsing 
 yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves 
 and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the are honoured and applauded the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious 
 you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly 
 then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character 
 we have 
 next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says 
 is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state 
 by all means 
 i believe that oligarchy follows next in order 
 and what manner of government do you term oligarchy 
 a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it 
 i understand he replied 
 ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises 
 yes 
 well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other 
 how 
 the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law 
 yes indeed 
 and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money 
 likely enough 
 and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls 
 true 
 and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured 
 clearly 
 and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected 
 that is obvious 
 and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 
 they do so 
 they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work 
 very true 
 and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established 
 yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking 
 first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot 
 you mean that they would shipwreck 
 yes and is not this true of the government of anything 
 i should imagine so 
 except a city or would you include a city 
 nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all 
 this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy 
 clearly 
 and here is another defect which is quite as bad 
 what defect 
 the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another 
 that surely is at least as bad 
 another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes 
 how discreditable 
 and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one does that look well 
 anything but well 
 there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable 
 what evil 
 a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature 
 yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state 
 the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty 
 true 
 but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift 
 as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift 
 may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive 
 just so socrates 
 and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed 
 most true he said 
 clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors 
 clearly 
 well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers 
 yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler 
 and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force 
 certainly we may be so bold 
 the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education and an evil constitution of the state 
 true 
 such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils 
 very likely 
 then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state 
 by all means 
 does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise 
 how 
 a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him 
 nothing more likely 
 and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion from his throne humbled by poverty he takes to and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar 
 most true he replied 
 and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it 
 of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one 
 and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth 
 yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came 
 let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them 
 very good 
 first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth 
 certainly 
 also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable 
 true 
 he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a true image of the state which he represents 
 he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state 
 you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said 
 i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 
 excellent i said yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life 
 true 
 do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries 
 where must i look 
 you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan 
 aye 
 it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions 
 to be sure 
 yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own 
 yes and they will be strong in him too 
 the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones 
 true 
 for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him 
 i should expect so 
 and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money 
 very true 
 can we any longer doubt then that the miser and answers to the oligarchical state 
 there can be no doubt 
 next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgement 
 that he said is our method 
 well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise is it not on this wise the good at which such a state alms is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable 
 what then 
 the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance 
 to be sure 
 there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded 
 that is tolerably clear 
 and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary 
 yes often 
 and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution 
 that is true 
 on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state 
 yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain 
 the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a use of his own property or by another remedy 
 what other 
 one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state 
 yes they will be greatly lessened 
 at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain 
 very true 
 they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue 
 yes quite as indifferent 
 such is the state of affairs which prevails among them and often rulers and their subjects may come in one way whether on a pilgrimage or a march as or aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much 
 yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking 
 and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause 
 yes surely 
 and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot 
 yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw 
 and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they for as the government is such will be the man 
 clearly he said 
 in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes 
 tis said so he replied 
 and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases 
 clearly 
 then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures 
 there will 
 this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states 
 yes 
 yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government 
 why 
 because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state 
 he will be sure to have patterns enough 
 and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful 
 for the moment yes 
 and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares 
 yes he replied many and many a one 
 see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the friend 
 yes she is of a noble spirit 
 these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike 
 we know her well 
 consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being 
 very good he said 
 is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits 
 exactly 
 and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary 
 obviously 
 would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures 
 i should 
 are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us and they are rightly so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it 
 true 
 we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary 
 we are not 
 and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary 
 yes certainly 
 suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them 
 very good 
 will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class 
 that is what i should suppose 
 the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life 
 yes 
 but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health 
 certainly 
 and the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary 
 very true 
 may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production 
 certainly 
 and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good 
 true 
 and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical 
 very true 
 again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process 
 what is the process 
 when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical 
 inevitably 
 and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike 
 certainly 
 and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself 
 it must be so 
 and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young soul and order is restored 
 yes he said that sometimes happens 
 and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous 
 yes he said that is apt to be the way 
 they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him 
 very true 
 at length they seize upon the citadel of the young soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels 
 none better 
 false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place 
 they are certain to do so 
 and so the young man returns into the country of the and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border 
 yes with a will 
 and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures 
 yes he said the change in him is visible enough 
 after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally 
 very true he said 
 neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another 
 yes he said that is the way with him 
 yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on 
 yes he replied he is all liberty and equality 
 yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him 
 just so 
 let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man 
 let that be his place he said 
 last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider 
 quite true he said 
 say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident 
 clearly 
 and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort 
 how 
 the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right 
 yes 
 and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of was also the ruin of oligarchy 
 true 
 and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution 
 what good 
 freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell 
 yes the saying is in mouth 
 i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny 
 how so 
 when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs 
 yes he replied a very common occurrence 
 yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public now in such a state can liberty have any limit 
 certainly not 
 by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them 
 how do you mean 
 i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either 
 yes he said that is the way 
 and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young 
 quite true he said 
 the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other 
 why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips 
 that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the as the proverb says are as good as their and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty 
 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe you and i have dreamed the same thing 
 and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them 
 yes he said i know it too well 
 such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny 
 glorious indeed he said but what is the next step 
 the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government 
 true 
 the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery 
 yes the natural order 
 and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty 
 as we might expect 
 that however was not as i believe your rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both 
 just so he replied 
 well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings 
 a very just comparison 
 these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible 
 yes by all means he said 
 then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state 
 that is true 
 and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified 
 how so 
 because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones 
 very true he said 
 then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass 
 what is that 
 they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be the richest 
 naturally so 
 they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones 
 why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little 
 and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them 
 that is pretty much the case he said 
 the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy 
 true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey 
 and do they not share i said do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves 
 why yes he said to that extent the people do share 
 and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can 
 what else can they do 
 and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy true 
 and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them 
 that is exactly the truth 
 then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another 
 true 
 the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness 
 yes that is their way 
 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector 
 yes that is quite clear 
 how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus 
 what tale 
 the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf did you never hear it 
 oh yes 
 and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant 
 inevitably 
 this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich 
 the same 
 after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown 
 that is clear 
 and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him 
 yes he said that is their usual way 
 then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the friend as they say be lost to them 
 exactly 
 the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves 
 very true 
 and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus 
 by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 
 and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again 
 but if he is caught he dies 
 of course 
 and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute 
 no doubt he said 
 and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated 
 yes he said let us consider that 
 at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one 
 of course he said 
 but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader 
 to be sure 
 has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him clearly 
 and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war 
 he must 
 now he begins to grow unpopular 
 a necessary result 
 then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done 
 yes that may be expected 
 and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything 
 he cannot 
 and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state 
 yes he said and a rare purgation 
 yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse 
 if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself 
 what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all 
 yes that is the alternative 
 and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require 
 certainly 
 and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them 
 they will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays them 
 by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land 
 yes he said there are 
 but will he not desire to get them on the spot 
 how do you mean 
 he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his bodyguard 
 to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all 
 what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends 
 yes he said they are quite of his sort 
 yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him 
 of course 
 verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian 
 why so 
 why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 
 tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions 
 yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets 
 and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny 
 yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us 
 but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies 
 very true 
 moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further 
 true 
 but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and army of his 
 if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people 
 and when these fail 
 why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his estate 
 you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions 
 yes he said they cannot help themselves 
 but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates 
 by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong 
 why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence what beat his father if he opposes him 
 yes he will having first disarmed him 
 then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery 
 true he said
