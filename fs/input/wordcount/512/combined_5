 socrates glaucon 
 and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings 
 that replied glaucon has been acknowledged 
 yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed 
 yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state 
 true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path 
 there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived 
 your recollection i said is most exact 
 then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then 
 yes if i can i will i said 
 i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking 
 that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state i do not know do you of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians 
 yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them 
 do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them 
 yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters 
 then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five 
 certainly 
 him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described 
 we have 
 then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice the enquiry will then be completed and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice 
 certainly he replied we must do as you say 
 shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision 
 that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable 
 first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved 
 very true he said 
 in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest 
 how would they address us 
 after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in existences pass over a short space and in ones over a long space but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great x and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i e omitting fractions the side of which is five x x each of them being less by one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five and a hundred cubes of three x now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us the muses first by music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like are of gold and silver and brass and iron and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us 
 yes and we may assume that they answer truly 
 why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely 
 and what do the muses say next 
 when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them 
 i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change 
 and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy 
 very true 
 such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities 
 true he said 
 in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former 
 true 
 but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar 
 yes 
 yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please 
 that is most true he said 
 and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music 
 undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil 
 why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element 
 assuredly he said 
 such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour 
 very true he replied 
 now what man answers to this form of did he come into being and what is he like 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon 
 perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different 
 in what respects 
 he should have more of and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase 
 yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy 
 such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost his best guardian 
 who was that said adeimantus 
 philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life 
 good he said 
 such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state 
 exactly 
 his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a grave father who dwells in an city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble 
 and how does the son come into being 
 the character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too adding all the other complaints about her own which women are so fond of rehearsing 
 yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves 
 and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the are honoured and applauded the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious 
 you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly 
 then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character 
 we have 
 next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says 
 is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state 
 by all means 
 i believe that oligarchy follows next in order 
 and what manner of government do you term oligarchy 
 a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it 
 i understand he replied 
 ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises 
 yes 
 well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other 
 how 
 the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law 
 yes indeed 
 and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money 
 likely enough 
 and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls 
 true 
 and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured 
 clearly 
 and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected 
 that is obvious 
 and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 
 they do so 
 they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work 
 very true 
 and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established 
 yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking 
 first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot 
 you mean that they would shipwreck 
 yes and is not this true of the government of anything 
 i should imagine so 
 except a city or would you include a city 
 nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all 
 this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy 
 clearly 
 and here is another defect which is quite as bad 
 what defect 
 the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another 
 that surely is at least as bad 
 another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes 
 how discreditable 
 and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one does that look well 
 anything but well 
 there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable 
 what evil 
 a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature 
 yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state 
 the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty 
 true 
 but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift 
 as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift 
 may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive 
 just so socrates 
 and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed 
 most true he said 
 clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors 
 clearly 
 well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers 
 yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler 
 and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force 
 certainly we may be so bold 
 the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education and an evil constitution of the state 
 true 
 such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils 
 very likely 
 then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state 
 by all means 
 does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise 
 how 
 a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him 
 nothing more likely 
 and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion from his throne humbled by poverty he takes to and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar 
 most true he replied 
 and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it 
 of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one 
 and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth 
 yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came 
 let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them 
 very good 
 first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth 
 certainly 
 also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable 
 true 
 he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a true image of the state which he represents 
 he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state 
 you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said 
 i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 
 excellent i said yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life 
 true 
 do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries 
 where must i look 
 you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan 
 aye 
 it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions 
 to be sure 
 yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own 
 yes and they will be strong in him too 
 the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones 
 true 
 for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him 
 i should expect so 
 and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money 
 very true 
 can we any longer doubt then that the miser and answers to the oligarchical state 
 there can be no doubt 
 next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgement 
 that he said is our method 
 well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise is it not on this wise the good at which such a state alms is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable 
 what then 
 the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance 
 to be sure 
 there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded 
 that is tolerably clear 
 and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary 
 yes often 
 and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution 
 that is true 
 on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state 
 yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain 
 the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a use of his own property or by another remedy 
 what other 
 one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state 
 yes they will be greatly lessened 
 at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain 
 very true 
 they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue 
 yes quite as indifferent 
 such is the state of affairs which prevails among them and often rulers and their subjects may come in one way whether on a pilgrimage or a march as or aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much 
 yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking 
 and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause 
 yes surely 
 and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot 
 yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw 
 and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they for as the government is such will be the man 
 clearly he said 
 in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes 
 tis said so he replied 
 and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases 
 clearly 
 then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures 
 there will 
 this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states 
 yes 
 yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government 
 why 
 because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state 
 he will be sure to have patterns enough 
 and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful 
 for the moment yes 
 and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares 
 yes he replied many and many a one 
 see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the friend 
 yes she is of a noble spirit 
 these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike 
 we know her well 
 consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being 
 very good he said 
 is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits 
 exactly 
 and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary 
 obviously 
 would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures 
 i should 
 are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us and they are rightly so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it 
 true 
 we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary 
 we are not 
 and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary 
 yes certainly 
 suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them 
 very good 
 will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class 
 that is what i should suppose 
 the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life 
 yes 
 but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health 
 certainly 
 and the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary 
 very true 
 may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production 
 certainly 
 and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good 
 true 
 and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical 
 very true 
 again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process 
 what is the process 
 when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical 
 inevitably 
 and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike 
 certainly 
 and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself 
 it must be so 
 and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young soul and order is restored 
 yes he said that sometimes happens 
 and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous 
 yes he said that is apt to be the way 
 they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him 
 very true 
 at length they seize upon the citadel of the young soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels 
 none better 
 false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place 
 they are certain to do so 
 and so the young man returns into the country of the and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border 
 yes with a will 
 and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures 
 yes he said the change in him is visible enough 
 after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally 
 very true he said 
 neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another 
 yes he said that is the way with him 
 yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on 
 yes he replied he is all liberty and equality 
 yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him 
 just so 
 let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man 
 let that be his place he said 
 last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider 
 quite true he said 
 say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident 
 clearly 
 and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort 
 how 
 the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right 
 yes 
 and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of was also the ruin of oligarchy 
 true 
 and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution 
 what good 
 freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell 
 yes the saying is in mouth 
 i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny 
 how so 
 when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs 
 yes he replied a very common occurrence 
 yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public now in such a state can liberty have any limit 
 certainly not 
 by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them 
 how do you mean 
 i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either 
 yes he said that is the way 
 and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young 
 quite true he said 
 the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other 
 why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips 
 that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the as the proverb says are as good as their and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty 
 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe you and i have dreamed the same thing 
 and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them 
 yes he said i know it too well 
 such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny 
 glorious indeed he said but what is the next step 
 the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government 
 true 
 the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery 
 yes the natural order 
 and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty 
 as we might expect 
 that however was not as i believe your rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both 
 just so he replied 
 well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings 
 a very just comparison 
 these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible 
 yes by all means he said 
 then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state 
 that is true 
 and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified 
 how so 
 because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones 
 very true he said 
 then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass 
 what is that 
 they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be the richest 
 naturally so 
 they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones 
 why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little 
 and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them 
 that is pretty much the case he said 
 the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy 
 true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey 
 and do they not share i said do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves 
 why yes he said to that extent the people do share 
 and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can 
 what else can they do 
 and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy true 
 and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them 
 that is exactly the truth 
 then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another 
 true 
 the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness 
 yes that is their way 
 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector 
 yes that is quite clear 
 how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus 
 what tale 
 the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf did you never hear it 
 oh yes 
 and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant 
 inevitably 
 this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich 
 the same 
 after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown 
 that is clear 
 and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him 
 yes he said that is their usual way 
 then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the friend as they say be lost to them 
 exactly 
 the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves 
 very true 
 and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus 
 by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 
 and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again 
 but if he is caught he dies 
 of course 
 and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute 
 no doubt he said 
 and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated 
 yes he said let us consider that 
 at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one 
 of course he said 
 but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader 
 to be sure 
 has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him clearly 
 and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war 
 he must 
 now he begins to grow unpopular 
 a necessary result 
 then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done 
 yes that may be expected 
 and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything 
 he cannot 
 and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state 
 yes he said and a rare purgation 
 yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse 
 if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself 
 what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all 
 yes that is the alternative 
 and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require 
 certainly 
 and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them 
 they will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays them 
 by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land 
 yes he said there are 
 but will he not desire to get them on the spot 
 how do you mean 
 he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his bodyguard 
 to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all 
 what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends 
 yes he said they are quite of his sort 
 yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him 
 of course 
 verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian 
 why so 
 why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 
 tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions 
 yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets 
 and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny 
 yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us 
 but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies 
 very true 
 moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further 
 true 
 but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and army of his 
 if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people 
 and when these fail 
 why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his estate 
 you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions 
 yes he said they cannot help themselves 
 but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates 
 by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong 
 why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence what beat his father if he opposes him 
 yes he will having first disarmed him 
 then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery 
 true he said 
 very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny 
 yes quite enough he said 
 
 
 lastindexnext 
 
 


 
 book ix 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in misery 
 yes he said he is the only one remaining 
 there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered 
 what question 
 i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused 
 well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
 very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them 
 which appetites do you mean 
 i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
 most true he said 
 but when a pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
 i quite agree 
 in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me 
 yes i agree 
 and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
 true 
 and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his meanness at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
 yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
 and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his principles 
 i can imagine him 
 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him 
 yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
 and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full 
 yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
 and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
 i should not wonder 
 further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
 he has 
 and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods 
 that he will 
 and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate o my friend is not that so 
 assuredly 
 such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live 
 suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
 i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul 
 that is certain 
 yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many 
 they are indeed he said 
 his revenues if he has any are soon spent 
 true 
 then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
 of course 
 when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
 yes that is sure to be the case 
 he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs 
 he must 
 and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs 
 no doubt he will 
 and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them 
 very true 
 and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
 yes probably 
 and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
 but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
 yes indeed he said i believe that he would 
 truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother 
 he is indeed he replied 
 he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself have we not here a picture of his way of life 
 yes indeed he said 
 and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city 
 what sort of mischief 
 for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes 
 a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number 
 yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant 
 yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
 if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters this is the end of his passions and desires 
 exactly 
 when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more 
 yes truly 
 they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
 certainly not 
 and may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
 no question 
 also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
 yes he said and we were perfectly right 
 let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
 most true 
 and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
 socrates glaucon 
 that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer 
 and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general 
 yes he said inevitably 
 and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others 
 certainly 
 and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man 
 to be sure 
 then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
 they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst 
 there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion 
 a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest 
 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
 that again he said is a very fair proposal 
 shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries 
 by all means 
 let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
 what do you mean he asked 
 beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
 no city he said can be more completely enslaved 
 and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state 
 yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
 then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest 
 inevitably 
 and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave 
 he has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily 
 utterly incapable 
 and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
 certainly 
 and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
 poor 
 and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
 true 
 and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear 
 yes indeed 
 is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain 
 certainly not 
 and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
 impossible 
 reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states 
 and i was right he said 
 certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him 
 i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
 there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong 
 what do you mean 
 i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
 then who is more miserable 
 one of whom i am about to speak 
 who is that 
 he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant 
 from what has been said i gather that you are right 
 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest 
 very true he said 
 let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject 
 what is your illustration 
 the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
 yes that is the difference 
 you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants 
 what should they fear 
 nothing but do you observe the reason of this 
 yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual 
 very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves 
 yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
 the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
 yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
 and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
 his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies 
 and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
 very true he said 
 and amid evils such as these will not he who is in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men 
 yes he said the similitude is most exact 
 is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
 certainly 
 he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds 
 very true he said 
 moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself 
 no man of any sense will dispute your words 
 come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
 the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
 need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state 
 make the proclamation yourself he said 
 and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 let the words be added 
 then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight 
 what is that 
 the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration 
 of what nature 
 it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers 
 how do you mean he said 
 there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money 
 that is true he said 
 if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money 
 i agree with you 
 again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame 
 true 
 suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable 
 extremely suitable 
 on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame 
 far less 
 lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul 
 certainly 
 one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen 
 yes 
 then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
 exactly 
 and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
 very true 
 now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver 
 true he said 
 and the lover of honour what will be his opinion will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
 very true 
 and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them 
 there can be no doubt of that he replied 
 since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly 
 i cannot myself tell he said 
 well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and wisdom and reason 
 there cannot be a better he said 
 then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain 
 the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
 then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience 
 yes very great 
 again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
 nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only 
 his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
 far better 
 and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
 certainly 
 further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
 what faculty 
 reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
 yes 
 and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
 certainly 
 if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
 assuredly 
 or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
 clearly 
 but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
 the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
 and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
 unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life 
 and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next 
 clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the 
 last comes the lover of gain 
 very true he said 
 twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls 
 yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
 i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
 proceed 
 say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
 true 
 and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
 there is 
 a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean 
 yes 
 you remember what people say when they are sick 
 what do they say 
 that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
 yes i know he said 
 and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain 
 i have 
 and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure 
 yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest 
 again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful 
 doubtless he said 
 then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain 
 so it would seem 
 but can that which is neither become both 
 i should say not 
 and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
 yes 
 but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them 
 yes 
 how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
 impossible 
 this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition 
 that is the inference 
 look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 what are they he said and where shall i find them 
 there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
 most true he said 
 let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 no 
 still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain 
 that is true 
 and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature 
 yes 
 shall i give you an illustration of them 
 let me hear 
 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region 
 i should 
 and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
 to be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
 but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending 
 no doubt 
 all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions 
 yes 
 then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this 
 no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
 look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state 
 yes 
 and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
 true 
 and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
 certainly 
 and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer 
 clearly from that which has more 
 what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal 
 far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable 
 and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence 
 yes of knowledge in the same degree 
 and of truth in the same degree 
 yes 
 and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence 
 necessarily 
 then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul 
 far less 
 and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
 yes 
 what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real 
 of course 
 and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
 unquestionably 
 those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
 verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle 
 their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth 
 something of that sort must inevitably happen 
 and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense 
 yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
 then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
 yes certainly the best is the most natural 
 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable 
 exactly 
 but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
 true 
 and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
 yes 
 and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order 
 clearly 
 and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance yes 
 and the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
 yes 
 then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least 
 certainly 
 but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly 
 inevitably 
 would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
 will you tell me 
 there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
 how do you mean 
 i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle 
 yes 
 and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch 
 he will 
 and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical 
 yes he is third 
 then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three 
 manifestly 
 the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure 
 certainly 
 and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king 
 yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
 or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval 
 what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
 yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 
 yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
 then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue 
 immeasurably greater 
 well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just 
 yes that was said 
 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him 
 what shall we say to him 
 let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes 
 of what sort 
 an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one 
 there are said of have been such unions 
 then do you now model the form of a multitudinous monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
 you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose 
 suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second 
 that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say 
 and now join them and let the three grow into one 
 that has been accomplished 
 next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature i have done so he said 
 and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
 to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
 he should watch over the monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself 
 yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
 and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant 
 yes from every point of view 
 come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now 
 not if he has any regard for my opinion 
 but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin 
 yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him 
 has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
 clearly 
 and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
 yes 
 and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him 
 very true 
 and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey 
 true he said 
 and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them 
 such appears to be the reason 
 and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals 
 true he said 
 and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways 
 yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness 
 from no point of view at all 
 what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body 
 certainly he said 
 to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
 clearly he said 
 in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
 certainly he will if he has true music in him 
 and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm 
 certainly not he said 
 he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means 
 very true 
 and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
 then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
 by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call 
 i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
 in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other 
 i think so he said

 book ix 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in misery 
 yes he said he is the only one remaining 
 there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered 
 what question 
 i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused 
 well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
 very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them 
 which appetites do you mean 
 i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
 most true he said 
 but when a pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
 i quite agree 
 in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me 
 yes i agree 
 and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
 true 
 and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his meanness at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
 yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
 and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his principles 
 i can imagine him 
 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him 
 yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
 and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full 
 yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
 and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
 i should not wonder 
 further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
 he has 
 and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods 
 that he will 
 and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate o my friend is not that so 
 assuredly 
 such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live 
 suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
 i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul 
 that is certain 
 yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many 
 they are indeed he said 
 his revenues if he has any are soon spent 
 true 
 then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
 of course 
 when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
 yes that is sure to be the case 
 he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs 
 he must 
 and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs 
 no doubt he will 
 and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them 
 very true 
 and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
 yes probably 
 and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
 but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
 yes indeed he said i believe that he would 
 truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother 
 he is indeed he replied 
 he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself have we not here a picture of his way of life 
 yes indeed he said 
 and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city 
 what sort of mischief 
 for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes 
 a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number 
 yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant 
 yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
 if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters this is the end of his passions and desires 
 exactly 
 when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more 
 yes truly 
 they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
 certainly not 
 and may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
 no question 
 also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
 yes he said and we were perfectly right 
 let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
 most true 
 and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
 socrates glaucon 
 that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer 
 and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general 
 yes he said inevitably 
 and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others 
 certainly 
 and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man 
 to be sure 
 then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
 they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst 
 there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion 
 a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest 
 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
 that again he said is a very fair proposal 
 shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries 
 by all means 
 let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
 what do you mean he asked 
 beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
 no city he said can be more completely enslaved 
 and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state 
 yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
 then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest 
 inevitably 
 and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave 
 he has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily 
 utterly incapable 
 and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
 certainly 
 and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
 poor 
 and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
 true 
 and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear 
 yes indeed 
 is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain 
 certainly not 
 and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
 impossible 
 reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states 
 and i was right he said 
 certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him 
 i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
 there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong 
 what do you mean 
 i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
 then who is more miserable 
 one of whom i am about to speak 
 who is that 
 he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant 
 from what has been said i gather that you are right 
 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest 
 very true he said 
 let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject 
 what is your illustration 
 the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
 yes that is the difference 
 you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants 
 what should they fear 
 nothing but do you observe the reason of this 
 yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual 
 very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves 
 yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
 the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
 yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
 and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
 his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies 
 and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
 very true he said 
 and amid evils such as these will not he who is in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men 
 yes he said the similitude is most exact 
 is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
 certainly 
 he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds 
 very true he said 
 moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself 
 no man of any sense will dispute your words 
 come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
 the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
 need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state 
 make the proclamation yourself he said 
 and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 let the words be added 
 then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight 
 what is that 
 the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration 
 of what nature 
 it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers 
 how do you mean he said 
 there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money 
 that is true he said 
 if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money 
 i agree with you 
 again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame 
 true 
 suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable 
 extremely suitable 
 on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame 
 far less 
 lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul 
 certainly 
 one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen 
 yes 
 then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
 exactly 
 and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
 very true 
 now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver 
 true he said 
 and the lover of honour what will be his opinion will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
 very true 
 and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them 
 there can be no doubt of that he replied 
 since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly 
 i cannot myself tell he said 
 well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and wisdom and reason 
 there cannot be a better he said 
 then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain 
 the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
 then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience 
 yes very great 
 again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
 nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only 
 his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
 far better 
 and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
 certainly 
 further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
 what faculty 
 reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
 yes 
 and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
 certainly 
 if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
 assuredly 
 or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
 clearly 
 but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
 the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
 and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
 unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life 
 and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next 
 clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the 
 last comes the lover of gain 
 very true he said 
 twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls 
 yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
 i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
 proceed 
 say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
 true 
 and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
 there is 
 a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean 
 yes 
 you remember what people say when they are sick 
 what do they say 
 that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
 yes i know he said 
 and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain 
 i have 
 and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure 
 yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest 
 again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful 
 doubtless he said 
 then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain 
 so it would seem 
 but can that which is neither become both 
 i should say not 
 and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
 yes 
 but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them 
 yes 
 how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
 impossible 
 this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition 
 that is the inference 
 look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 what are they he said and where shall i find them 
 there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
 most true he said 
 let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 no 
 still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain 
 that is true 
 and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature 
 yes 
 shall i give you an illustration of them 
 let me hear 
 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region 
 i should 
 and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
 to be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
 but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending 
 no doubt 
 all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions 
 yes 
 then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this 
 no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
 look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state 
 yes 
 and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
 true 
 and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
 certainly 
 and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer 
 clearly from that which has more 
 what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal 
 far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable 
 and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence 
 yes of knowledge in the same degree 
 and of truth in the same degree 
 yes 
 and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence 
 necessarily 
 then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul 
 far less 
 and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
 yes 
 what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real 
 of course 
 and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
 unquestionably 
 those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
 verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle 
 their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth 
 something of that sort must inevitably happen 
 and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense 
 yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
 then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
 yes certainly the best is the most natural 
 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable 
 exactly 
 but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
 true 
 and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
 yes 
 and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order 
 clearly 
 and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance yes 
 and the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
 yes 
 then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least 
 certainly 
 but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly 
 inevitably 
 would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
 will you tell me 
 there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
 how do you mean 
 i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle 
 yes 
 and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch 
 he will 
 and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical 
 yes he is third 
 then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three 
 manifestly 
 the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure 
 certainly 
 and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king 
 yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
 or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval 
 what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
 yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 
 yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
 then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue 
 immeasurably greater 
 well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just 
 yes that was said 
 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him 
 what shall we say to him 
 let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes 
 of what sort 
 an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one 
 there are said of have been such unions 
 then do you now model the form of a multitudinous monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
 you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose 
 suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second 
 that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say 
 and now join them and let the three grow into one 
 that has been accomplished 
 next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature i have done so he said 
 and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
 to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
 he should watch over the monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself 
 yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
 and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant 
 yes from every point of view 
 come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now 
 not if he has any regard for my opinion 
 but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin 
 yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him 
 has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
 clearly 
 and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
 yes 
 and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him 
 very true 
 and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey 
 true he said 
 and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them 
 such appears to be the reason 
 and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals 
 true he said 
 and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways 
 yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness 
 from no point of view at all 
 what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body 
 certainly he said 
 to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
 clearly he said 
 in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
 certainly he will if he has true music in him 
 and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm 
 certainly not he said 
 he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means 
 very true 
 and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
 then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
 by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call 
 i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
 in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other 
 i think so he said

 book x 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry 
 to what do you refer 
 to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished 
 what do you mean 
 speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them 
 explain the purport of your remark 
 well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out 
 very good he said 
 listen to me then or rather answer me 
 put your question 
 can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know 
 a likely thing then that i should know 
 why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener 
 very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself 
 well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me 
 i do 
 let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not 
 yes 
 but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table 
 true 
 and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he 
 impossible 
 and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him 
 who is he 
 one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
 what an extraordinary man 
 wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also 
 he must be a wizard and no mistake 
 oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself 
 what way 
 an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror 
 yes he said but they would be appearances only 
 very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not 
 of course 
 but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
 yes he said but not a real bed 
 and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed 
 yes i did 
 then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
 at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth 
 no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth 
 no wonder 
 suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is 
 if you please 
 well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
 no 
 there is another which is the work of the carpenter 
 yes 
 and the work of the painter is a third 
 yes 
 beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 
 yes there are three of them 
 god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god 
 why is that 
 because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others 
 very true he said 
 god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
 so we believe 
 shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed 
 yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things 
 and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed 
 yes 
 but would you call the painter a creator and maker 
 certainly not 
 yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
 i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make 
 good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator 
 certainly he said 
 and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
 that appears to be so 
 then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painter i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
 the latter 
 as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things 
 yes he said the difference is only apparent 
 now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality 
 of appearance 
 then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
 certainly 
 and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
 most true 
 and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
 the question he said should by all means be considered 
 now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the branch would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him 
 i should say not 
 the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
 yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit 
 then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you is there any city which he might name 
 i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator 
 well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
 there is not 
 or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
 there is absolutely nothing of the kind 
 but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him 
 nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive 
 yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough 
 yes socrates that i think is quite true 
 then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures 
 quite so 
 in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose 
 yes he said 
 they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
 exactly 
 here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only am i not right 
 yes 
 then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation 
 proceed 
 of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit 
 yes 
 and the worker in leather and brass will make them 
 certainly 
 but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
 most true 
 and may we not say the same of all things 
 what 
 that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
 yes 
 and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them 
 true 
 then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the will tell the which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
 of course 
 the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him 
 true 
 the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
 true 
 but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw 
 neither 
 then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
 i suppose not 
 the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations 
 nay very much the reverse 
 and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
 just so 
 thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
 very true 
 and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
 certainly 
 and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
 what do you mean 
 i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance 
 true 
 and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic 
 true 
 and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
 most true 
 and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul 
 to be sure 
 and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction 
 true 
 but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
 very true 
 then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure 
 true 
 and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation 
 certainly 
 and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul 
 no doubt 
 this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
 exactly 
 the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring 
 very true 
 and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
 probably the same would be true of poetry 
 do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
 by all means 
 we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything more 
 no there is nothing else 
 but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
 and we were right he said 
 yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied 
 what was the omission 
 were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another 
 yes 
 but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
 the latter he said is the truer statement 
 tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
 it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
 when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
 true 
 there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow 
 true 
 but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him 
 certainly 
 one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
 how do you mean 
 the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
 what is most required he asked 
 that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
 yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
 yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason 
 clearly 
 and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly 
 indeed we may 
 and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers 
 certainly 
 then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated 
 clearly 
 and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 
 exactly 
 but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
 yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
 hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most 
 yes of course i know 
 but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
 very true he said 
 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person 
 no he said that is certainly not reasonable 
 nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view 
 what point of view 
 if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
 how very true 
 and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home 
 quite true he said 
 and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue 
 i cannot deny it 
 therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state 
 that is most true he said 
 and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer 
 yes indeed i am greatly charmed 
 shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre 
 certainly 
 and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
 certainly he said we shall the gainers 
 if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law 
 yes he said i quite agree with you 
 yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been 
 and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue 
 what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness 
 why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity 
 say rather nothing he replied 
 and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole 
 of the whole certainly but why do you ask 
 are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
 he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this 
 yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it 
 i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light 
 listen then 
 i am attending 
 there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
 yes he replied 
 would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
 yes 
 and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
 yes he said 
 and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
 true 
 the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil 
 certainly not 
 if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction 
 that may be assumed 
 well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
 yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
 but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true 
 yes 
 consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body 
 certainly not 
 and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
 it is he replied 
 consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny 
 very true 
 and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another 
 yes he said there is reason in that 
 either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man 
 and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death 
 but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds 
 nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her from being a house of death 
 true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
 yes that can hardly be 
 but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal 
 certainly 
 that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality 
 very true 
 but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity 
 what do you mean he said 
 the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
 certainly not 
 her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but not there glaucon not there must we look 
 where then 
 at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough 
 true he replied 
 and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades 
 very true 
 and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
 certainly not he said 
 will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
 what did i borrow 
 the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice do you remember 
 i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 
 then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own 
 the demand he said is just 
 in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods 
 granted 
 and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
 true 
 and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins 
 certainly 
 then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue 
 yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him 
 and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
 certainly 
 such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
 that is my conviction 
 and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
 true 
 and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
 certainly he said what you say is true 
 these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides 
 yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
 and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them 
 speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear 
 socrates 
 well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great 
 now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the of a trireme from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other 
 when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness 
 and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations 
 all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
 and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

 book x 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry 
 to what do you refer 
 to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished 
 what do you mean 
 speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them 
 explain the purport of your remark 
 well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out 
 very good he said 
 listen to me then or rather answer me 
 put your question 
 can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know 
 a likely thing then that i should know 
 why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener 
 very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself 
 well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me 
 i do 
 let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not 
 yes 
 but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table 
 true 
 and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he 
 impossible 
 and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him 
 who is he 
 one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
 what an extraordinary man 
 wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also 
 he must be a wizard and no mistake 
 oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself 
 what way 
 an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror 
 yes he said but they would be appearances only 
 very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not 
 of course 
 but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
 yes he said but not a real bed 
 and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed 
 yes i did 
 then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
 at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth 
 no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth 
 no wonder 
 suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is 
 if you please 
 well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
 no 
 there is another which is the work of the carpenter 
 yes 
 and the work of the painter is a third 
 yes 
 beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 
 yes there are three of them 
 god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god 
 why is that 
 because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others 
 very true he said 
 god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
 so we believe 
 shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed 
 yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things 
 and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed 
 yes 
 but would you call the painter a creator and maker 
 certainly not 
 yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
 i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make 
 good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator 
 certainly he said 
 and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
 that appears to be so 
 then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painter i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
 the latter 
 as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things 
 yes he said the difference is only apparent 
 now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality 
 of appearance 
 then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
 certainly 
 and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
 most true 
 and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
 the question he said should by all means be considered 
 now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the branch would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him 
 i should say not 
 the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
 yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit 
 then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you is there any city which he might name 
 i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator 
 well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
 there is not 
 or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
 there is absolutely nothing of the kind 
 but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him 
 nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive 
 yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough 
 yes socrates that i think is quite true 
 then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures 
 quite so 
 in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose 
 yes he said 
 they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
 exactly 
 here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only am i not right 
 yes 
 then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation 
 proceed 
 of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit 
 yes 
 and the worker in leather and brass will make them 
 certainly 
 but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
 most true 
 and may we not say the same of all things 
 what 
 that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
 yes 
 and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them 
 true 
 then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the will tell the which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
 of course 
 the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him 
 true 
 the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
 true 
 but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw 
 neither 
 then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
 i suppose not 
 the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations 
 nay very much the reverse 
 and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
 just so 
 thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
 very true 
 and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
 certainly 
 and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
 what do you mean 
 i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance 
 true 
 and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic 
 true 
 and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
 most true 
 and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul 
 to be sure 
 and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction 
 true 
 but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
 very true 
 then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure 
 true 
 and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation 
 certainly 
 and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul 
 no doubt 
 this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
 exactly 
 the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring 
 very true 
 and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
 probably the same would be true of poetry 
 do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
 by all means 
 we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything more 
 no there is nothing else 
 but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
 and we were right he said 
 yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied 
 what was the omission 
 were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another 
 yes 
 but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
 the latter he said is the truer statement 
 tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
 it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
 when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
 true 
 there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow 
 true 
 but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him 
 certainly 
 one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
 how do you mean 
 the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
 what is most required he asked 
 that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
 yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
 yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason 
 clearly 
 and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly 
 indeed we may 
 and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers 
 certainly 
 then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated 
 clearly 
 and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 
 exactly 
 but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
 yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
 hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most 
 yes of course i know 
 but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
 very true he said 
 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person 
 no he said that is certainly not reasonable 
 nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view 
 what point of view 
 if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
 how very true 
 and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home 
 quite true he said 
 and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue 
 i cannot deny it 
 therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state 
 that is most true he said 
 and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer 
 yes indeed i am greatly charmed 
 shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre 
 certainly 
 and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
 certainly he said we shall the gainers 
 if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law 
 yes he said i quite agree with you 
 yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been 
 and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue 
 what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness 
 why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity 
 say rather nothing he replied 
 and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole 
 of the whole certainly but why do you ask 
 are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
 he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this 
 yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it 
 i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light 
 listen then 
 i am attending 
 there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
 yes he replied 
 would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
 yes 
 and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
 yes he said 
 and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
 true 
 the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil 
 certainly not 
 if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction 
 that may be assumed 
 well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
 yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
 but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true 
 yes 
 consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body 
 certainly not 
 and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
 it is he replied 
 consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny 
 very true 
 and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another 
 yes he said there is reason in that 
 either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man 
 and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death 
 but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds 
 nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her from being a house of death 
 true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
 yes that can hardly be 
 but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal 
 certainly 
 that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality 
 very true 
 but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity 
 what do you mean he said 
 the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
 certainly not 
 her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but not there glaucon not there must we look 
 where then 
 at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough 
 true he replied 
 and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades 
 very true 
 and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
 certainly not he said 
 will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
 what did i borrow 
 the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice do you remember 
 i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 
 then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own 
 the demand he said is just 
 in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods 
 granted 
 and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
 true 
 and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins 
 certainly 
 then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue 
 yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him 
 and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
 certainly 
 such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
 that is my conviction 
 and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
 true 
 and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
 certainly he said what you say is true 
 these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides 
 yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
 and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them 
 speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear 
 socrates 
 well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great 
 now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the of a trireme from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other 
 when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness 
 and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations 
 all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
 and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

 true or false that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do m myriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of aix hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar 
 it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk 
 he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry 
 the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed

 the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powers of these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him 
 was he in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune

 mademoiselle baptistine was a long pale thin gentle creature she realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen she was a soul rather than a virgin

 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes 
 the truck continues through the city but ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front as it is stopped she hops out running to the footpath as the truck screeches away she leans against a tree yawning then continues on

 a new hope 
 i 
 
 it was a vast shining globe and it cast a light of lambent topaz into it wasnot a sun thus the planet had fooled men for a long time not until entering closeorbit around it did its discoverers realize that this was a world in a binary system andnot a third sun itself 
 at first it seemed certain nothing could exist on such a planet least of all both massive g and g stars orbited a common center with peculiar to permitthe development of a rather stable if exquisitely hot climate mostly this was a drydesert of a world whose unusual yellow glow was the result of doublesunlight striking sands and flats that same sunlight suddenly shone onthe thin skin of a metallic shape falling crazily toward the atmosphere 
 the erratic course the galactic cruiser was traveling was intentional not theproduct of injury but of a desperate desire to avoid it long streaks of intense energyslid close past its hull a multihued storm of destruction like a school of rainbowremoras fighting to attach themselves to a larger unwilling host 
 one of those probing questing beams succeeded in touching the fleeing its principal solar fin gemlike fragments of mental and plastic erupted intospace as the end of the fin disintegrated the vessel seemed to shudder 
 the source of those multiple energy beams suddenly hove into imperial cruise its massive outline bristling cactuslike with dozens ofheavy weapons emplacements light ceased arching from those spines now as thecruiser moved in close intermittent explosions and flashes of light could be seen inthose portion of the smaller ship which had taken hits in the absolute cold of spacethe cruiser snuggled up alongside its wounded prey 
 another distant explosions shook the it certainly feel distant toartoo detoo or see threepio the concussion bounced them around the narrowcorridor like bearings in an old motor 
 to look at these two one would have supposed that the tall was the master and the stubby tripodal robot artoo detoo an while threepio might have sniffed disdainfully at the suggestion they were infact equal in everything save loquacity here threepio was clearly andnecessarily the superior 
 still another explosion rattled the corridor throwing threepio off balance hisshorter companion had the better of it during such moments with his squat low center of gravity well balanced on thick clawed glanced up at threepio who was steadying himself against a corridor blinked enigmatically around a single mechanical eye as the smaller robotstudied the battered casing of his friend a patina of metal and fibrous dust coatedthe usually gleaming bronze finish and there were some visible dents all the resultof the pounding the rebel ship they were on had been taking 
 accompanying the last attack was a persistent deep hum which even the loudestexplosion had not been able to drown out then for no apparent reason the bassothrumming abruptly ceased and the only sounds in the otherwise deserted corridorcame from the eerie crackle of shorting relays or the pops of dying began to echo through the ship once more but they were far away fromthe corridor 
 threepio turned his smooth humanlike head to one side metallic ears listenedintently the imitation of a human pose was hardly auditorysensors were fully the slim robot had been programmed toblend perfectly among human company this programming extended even tomimicry of human gestures 
 did you hear that he inquired rhetorically of his patient companion referringto the throbbing sound shut down the main reactor and the drive hisvoice was as full of disbelief and concern as that of any human one metallic palmrubbed dolefully at a patch of dull gray on his side where a broken hull brace hadfallen and scored the bronze finish threepio was a fastidious machine and suchthings troubled him 
 madness this is madness he shook his head slowly this time bedestroyed for sure 
 artoo did not comment immediately barrel torso tilted backward powerfullegs gripping the deck the robot was engrossed in studying the roofoverhead though he did not have a head to cock in a listening posture like hisfriend artoo still somehow managed to convey that impression a series of shortbeeps and chirps issued from his speaker to even a sensitive human ear they wouldhave been just so much static but to threepio they formed words as clear and pure asdirect current 
 yes i suppose they did have to shut the drive down threepio admitted butwhat are we going to do now we enter atmosphere with our main stablizer findestroyed i believe simply going to surrender 
 a small band of armed humans suddenly appeared rifles held at the expressions were as as their uniforms and they carried aboutthem the aura of men prepared to die 
 threepio watched silently until they had vanished around a far bend in thepassageway then looked back at artoo the smaller robot shifted from hisposition of listening gaze turned upward also though he knew were slightly sharper than his own 
 what is it artoo a short burst of beeping came in response anothermoment and there was no need for highly attuned sensors for a minute or twomore the corridor remained deathly silent then a faint scrape scrape could beheard like a cat at a door from somewhere on the hull 
 when several muffled explosions sounded threepio murmured in somewhere above us no escape for the captain this he peered down at artoo i think better 
 the shriek of overstressed metal filled the air before he could finish and the farend of the passageway was lit by a blinding actinic flash somewhere down therethe little cluster of armed crew who had passed by minutes before had encountered attackers 
 threepio turned his face and delicate photoreceptors away just in time to avoidthe fragments of metal that flew down the corridor at the far end a gaping holeappeared in the roof and reflective forms like big metal beads began dropping to thecorridor floor both robots knew that no machine could match the fluidity withwhich those shapes moved and instantly assumed fighting postures the newarrivals were humans in armor not mechanicals 
 one of them looked straight at not at him the panicked robotthrough frantically but past him the figure shifted its big rifle around in armoredhands too late a beam of intense light struck the head sending pieces of and flesh flying in all directions 
 half the invading imperial troops turned and began returning fire up past the two robots 
 way threepio ordered intending to retreat from the turned with him they had taken only a couple of steps when they saw therebel crewmen in position ahead firing down the corridor in seconds thepassageway was filled with smoke and crisscrossing beams of energy 
 red green and blue bolts ricocheted off polished sections of wall and floor orripped long gashes in metal surfaces screams of injured and dying humans apeculiarly unrobotic sound threepio piercingly above the inorganicdestruction 
 one beam struck near the feet at the same time as a second one burst thewall directly behind him exposing sparking circuitry and rows of conduits theforce of the twin blast tumbled threepio into the shredded cables where a dozendifferent currents turned him into a jerking twisting display 
 strange sensations coursed through his metal they caused no confusion every time he moved and tried to free himself there was anotherviolent crackling as a fresh cluster of componentry broke the noise and remained constant around him as the battle continued to rage

 it was a vast shining globe and it cast a light of lambent topaz into it wasnot a sun thus the planet had fooled men for a long time not until entering closeorbit around it did its discoverers realize that this was a world in a binary system andnot a third sun itself 
 at first it seemed certain nothing could exist on such a planet least of all both massive g and g stars orbited a common center with peculiar to permitthe development of a rather stable if exquisitely hot climate mostly this was a drydesert of a world whose unusual yellow glow was the result of doublesunlight striking sands and flats that same sunlight suddenly shone onthe thin skin of a metallic shape falling crazily toward the atmosphere 
 the erratic course the galactic cruiser was traveling was intentional not theproduct of injury but of a desperate desire to avoid it long streaks of intense energyslid close past its hull a multihued storm of destruction like a school of rainbowremoras fighting to attach themselves to a larger unwilling host 
 one of those probing questing beams succeeded in touching the fleeing its principal solar fin gemlike fragments of mental and plastic erupted intospace as the end of the fin disintegrated the vessel seemed to shudder 
 the source of those multiple energy beams suddenly hove into imperial cruise its massive outline bristling cactuslike with dozens ofheavy weapons emplacements light ceased arching from those spines now as thecruiser moved in close intermittent explosions and flashes of light could be seen inthose portion of the smaller ship which had taken hits in the absolute cold of spacethe cruiser snuggled up alongside its wounded prey 
 another distant explosions shook the it certainly feel distant toartoo detoo or see threepio the concussion bounced them around the narrowcorridor like bearings in an old motor 
 to look at these two one would have supposed that the tall was the master and the stubby tripodal robot artoo detoo an while threepio might have sniffed disdainfully at the suggestion they were infact equal in everything save loquacity here threepio was clearly andnecessarily the superior 
 still another explosion rattled the corridor throwing threepio off balance hisshorter companion had the better of it during such moments with his squat low center of gravity well balanced on thick clawed glanced up at threepio who was steadying himself against a corridor blinked enigmatically around a single mechanical eye as the smaller robotstudied the battered casing of his friend a patina of metal and fibrous dust coatedthe usually gleaming bronze finish and there were some visible dents all the resultof the pounding the rebel ship they were on had been taking 
 accompanying the last attack was a persistent deep hum which even the loudestexplosion had not been able to drown out then for no apparent reason the bassothrumming abruptly ceased and the only sounds in the otherwise deserted corridorcame from the eerie crackle of shorting relays or the pops of dying began to echo through the ship once more but they were far away fromthe corridor 
 threepio turned his smooth humanlike head to one side metallic ears listenedintently the imitation of a human pose was hardly auditorysensors were fully the slim robot had been programmed toblend perfectly among human company this programming extended even tomimicry of human gestures 
 did you hear that he inquired rhetorically of his patient companion referringto the throbbing sound shut down the main reactor and the drive hisvoice was as full of disbelief and concern as that of any human one metallic palmrubbed dolefully at a patch of dull gray on his side where a broken hull brace hadfallen and scored the bronze finish threepio was a fastidious machine and suchthings troubled him 
 madness this is madness he shook his head slowly this time bedestroyed for sure 
 artoo did not comment immediately barrel torso tilted backward powerfullegs gripping the deck the robot was engrossed in studying the roofoverhead though he did not have a head to cock in a listening posture like hisfriend artoo still somehow managed to convey that impression a series of shortbeeps and chirps issued from his speaker to even a sensitive human ear they wouldhave been just so much static but to threepio they formed words as clear and pure asdirect current 
 yes i suppose they did have to shut the drive down threepio admitted butwhat are we going to do now we enter atmosphere with our main stablizer findestroyed i believe simply going to surrender 
 a small band of armed humans suddenly appeared rifles held at the expressions were as as their uniforms and they carried aboutthem the aura of men prepared to die 
 threepio watched silently until they had vanished around a far bend in thepassageway then looked back at artoo the smaller robot shifted from hisposition of listening gaze turned upward also though he knew were slightly sharper than his own 
 what is it artoo a short burst of beeping came in response anothermoment and there was no need for highly attuned sensors for a minute or twomore the corridor remained deathly silent then a faint scrape scrape could beheard like a cat at a door from somewhere on the hull 
 when several muffled explosions sounded threepio murmured in somewhere above us no escape for the captain this he peered down at artoo i think better 
 the shriek of overstressed metal filled the air before he could finish and the farend of the passageway was lit by a blinding actinic flash somewhere down therethe little cluster of armed crew who had passed by minutes before had encountered attackers 
 threepio turned his face and delicate photoreceptors away just in time to avoidthe fragments of metal that flew down the corridor at the far end a gaping holeappeared in the roof and reflective forms like big metal beads began dropping to thecorridor floor both robots knew that no machine could match the fluidity withwhich those shapes moved and instantly assumed fighting postures the newarrivals were humans in armor not mechanicals 
 one of them looked straight at not at him the panicked robotthrough frantically but past him the figure shifted its big rifle around in armoredhands too late a beam of intense light struck the head sending pieces of and flesh flying in all directions 
 half the invading imperial troops turned and began returning fire up past the two robots 
 way threepio ordered intending to retreat from the turned with him they had taken only a couple of steps when they saw therebel crewmen in position ahead firing down the corridor in seconds thepassageway was filled with smoke and crisscrossing beams of energy 
 red green and blue bolts ricocheted off polished sections of wall and floor orripped long gashes in metal surfaces screams of injured and dying humans apeculiarly unrobotic sound threepio piercingly above the inorganicdestruction 
 one beam struck near the feet at the same time as a second one burst thewall directly behind him exposing sparking circuitry and rows of conduits theforce of the twin blast tumbled threepio into the shredded cables where a dozendifferent currents turned him into a jerking twisting display 
 strange sensations coursed through his metal they caused no confusion every time he moved and tried to free himself there was anotherviolent crackling as a fresh cluster of componentry broke the noise and remained constant around him as the battle continued to rage 
 smoke began to fill the corridor artoo detoo bustled about trying to help freehis friend the little robot evidenced a phlegmatic indifference to the raveningenergies filling the passageway he was built so low that most of the beams passedover him anyhow 
 help threepio yelled suddenly frightened at a new message from aninternal sensor i think something is melting free my left nearthe pelvic servomotor typically his tone turned abruptly from pleading to berating

 chapter ii 
 
 anna drawing room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged prince daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father to the entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg was also there she had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions prince son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come 
 the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
 to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna mentioned each name and then left them 
 each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of her majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening 
 the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her upper lip and her mouth seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day 
 the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out her arms to show her dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast 
 soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna 
 you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene 
 what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna 
 one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with hair spectacles the breeches fashionable 
 at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a grandee of time who now lay dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of this greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room 
 it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her 
 pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance 
 anna alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her health anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting man 
 yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible 
 you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the plan chimerical 
 we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile 
 and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe 
 pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing

 anna drawing room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged prince daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father to the entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg was also there she had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions prince son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come 
 the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
 to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna mentioned each name and then left them 
 each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of her majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening 
 the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her upper lip and her mouth seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day 
 the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out her arms to show her dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast 
 soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna 
 you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene 
 what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna 
 one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with hair spectacles the breeches fashionable 
 at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a grandee of time who now lay dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of this greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room 
 it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her 
 pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance 
 anna alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her health anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting man 
 yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible 
 you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the plan chimerical 
 we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile 
 and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe 
 pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing

 chapter 
 
 yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights on coming up from dinner however i dine between twelve and one the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at five on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a walk arrived at garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower 
 on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled 
 wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality at least i would not keep my doors barred in the day time i will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn 
 whet are ye for he shouted t dahn i t fowld go rahnd by th end ut laith if yah went tuh spake tull him 
 is there nobody inside to open the door i hallooed responsively 
 nobbut t missis and nut an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght 
 why cannot you tell her who i am eh joseph 
 me hae noa hend muttered the head vanishing 
 the snow began to drive thickly i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a and a paved area containing a coal shed pump and pigeon cot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute 
 rough weather i remarked afraid mrs heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me 
 she never opened her mouth i stared also at any rate she kept her eyes on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable 
 sit down said the young man gruffly be in soon 
 i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance 
 a beautiful animal i commenced again do you intend parting with the little ones madam 
 they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied 
 ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats 
 a strange choice of favourites she observed scornfully 
 unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening 
 you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the two of the painted canisters 
 her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eyes had they been agreeable in expression they would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his gold 
 i want your help she snapped i can get them for myself 
 i beg your pardon i hastened to reply 
 were you asked to tea she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot 
 i shall be glad to have a cup i answered 
 were you asked she repeated 
 no i said half smiling you are the proper person to ask me 
 she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red under lip pushed out like a ready to cry 
 meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eyes for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr and mrs heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a assiduity in attending on the lady of the house in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state 
 you see sir i am come according to promise i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weatherbound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space 
 half an hour he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snowstorm to ramble about in do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present 
 perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till you spare me one 
 no i could not 
 oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity 
 umph 
 are you going to mak th tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady 
 is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff 
 get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me sir bring forward your chair and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal 
 i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their everyday countenance 
 it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr heathcliff yet venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart 
 my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is amiable lady 
 mrs heathcliff your wife i mean 
 well you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone is that it 
 perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years the other did not look seventeen 
 then it flashed upon clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad must beware how i cause her to regret her choice the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive 
 mrs heathcliff is my said heathcliff corroborating my surmise he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul 
 ah see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour 
 this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice 
 unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead i said she was my therefore she must have married my son 
 and this young man is 
 not my son assuredly 
 heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him 
 my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and counsel you to respect it 
 shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself 
 he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralized the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time 
 the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow 
 i think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance 
 hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff 
 how must i do i continued with rising irritation 
 there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the as she restored the tea canister to its place the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out 
 aw woonder hagh yah can faishion tuh stand thear i idleness un war when all on goan aght bud a nowt and noa use talking niver mend uh yer ill ways bud goa raight tuh t divil like yer mother afore ye 
 i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door mrs heathcliff however checked me by her answer 
 you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf show you how far progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it the red cow die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations 
 oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil 
 no reprobate you are a off or hurt you seriously have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix not say what he shall be done see go looking at you 
 the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress 
 mrs heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face sure you cannot help being do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london 
 take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her it is brief advice but as sound as i can give 
 then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience whisper that it is partly your fault 
 how so i cannot escort you they let me go to the end of the garden wall 
 you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way net to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide 
 who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have 
 are there no boys at the farm 
 no those are all 
 then it follows that i am compelled to stay 
 that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it 
 i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do 
 i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied 
 no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit anyone the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch 
 with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me 
 go with him as far as the park he said 
 go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh 
 a life is of more consequence than one neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected 
 not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him better be quiet 
 then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply 
 hearken hearken cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering 
 he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern 
 maister maister stealing t lantern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him 
 on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me their peril to keep me one minute several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear 
 the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the young scoundrel 
 well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for at t poor lad fair choking wisht wisht you go on so come in and cure that there now hold ye still 
 with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness 
 i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed

 you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way net to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide 
 who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have 
 are there no boys at the farm 
 no those are all 
 then it follows that i am compelled to stay 
 that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it 
 i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do 
 i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied 
 no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit anyone the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch 
 with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me 
 go with him as far as the park he said 
 go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh 
 a life is of more consequence than one neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected 
 not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him better be quiet 
 then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply 
 hearken hearken cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering 
 he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern 
 maister maister stealing t lantern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him 
 on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me their peril to keep me one minute several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear 
 the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the young scoundrel 
 well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for at t poor lad fair choking wisht wisht you go on so come in and cure that there now hold ye still 
 with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness 
 i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed

 chapter two 
 
 jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies then she remembered her promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little book she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow a green covered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also one the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day 
 in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given 
 girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day 
 then she opened her new book and began to read jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face 
 how good meg is come amy do as they do help you with the hard words and they explain things if we understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example 
 glad mine is blue said amy and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting 
 where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later 
 goodness only knows some poor creeter came and your ma went straight off to see what was needed there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant 
 she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time why where is bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear 
 she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers 
 how nice my handkerchiefs look they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor 
 bless the child gone and put mother on them instead of m march how funny cried jo taking one up 
 that right i thought it was better to do it so because initials are and i want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled 
 all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth 
 mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall 
 amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her 
 where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early 
 laugh at me jo i mean anyone should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and truly trying not to be selfish any more 
 as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle 
 you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and so glad for mine is the handsomest now 
 another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast 
 merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus merry christmas little daughters glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present 
 they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously so glad you came before we began 
 may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly 
 i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked 
 meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate 
 i thought do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime 
 they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party 
 a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm 
 how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in 
 ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy 
 funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing 
 in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english 
 das ist gut die cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning 
 loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels 
 not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table 
 coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor 
 beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit 
 there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work 
 the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels 
 no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society 
 on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began 
 a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred to roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee 
 out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter 
 hither hither from thy home 
 airy sprite i bid thee come 
 born of roses fed on dew 
 charms and potions canst thou brew 
 bring me here with elfin speed 
 the fragrant philter which i need 
 make it sweet and swift and strong 
 spirit answer now my song 
 a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang 
 hither i come 
 from my airy home 
 afar in the silver moon 
 take the magic spell 
 and use it well 
 or its power will vanish soon 
 and dropping a small gilded bottle at the feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play 
 a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on shoulder and was about to leap gracfully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins 
 a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside 
 laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made 
 act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody 
 this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together 
 act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love 
 act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace 
 tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper 
 this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers 
 it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely 
 is it fairies asked amy 
 santa claus said beth 
 mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows 
 aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration 
 all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march 
 the laurence grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we know him exclaimed meg 
 
 
 hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breakfast 
 that boy put it into his head i know he did a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if like to know us but bashful and meg is so prim she let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction 
 you mean the people who live in the big house next door you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says very proud and like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he come mother says very nice though he never speaks to us girls 
 our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun sure he does said jo decidedly 
 i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own 
 a mercy you mother laughed jo looking at her boots but have another play sometime that he can see perhaps help act that be jolly 
 i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest 
 they are lovely but roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the posy in her belt 
 beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father afraid he having such a merry christmas as we are

 and dropping a small gilded bottle at the feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play 
 a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on shoulder and was about to leap gracfully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins 
 a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside 
 laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made 
 act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody 
 this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together 
 act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love 
 act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace 
 tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper 
 this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers 
 it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely 
 is it fairies asked amy 
 santa claus said beth 
 mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows 
 aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration 
 all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march 
 the laurence grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we know him exclaimed meg 
 
 
 hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breakfast 
 that boy put it into his head i know he did a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if like to know us but bashful and meg is so prim she let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction 
 you mean the people who live in the big house next door you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says very proud and like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he come mother says very nice though he never speaks to us girls 
 our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun sure he does said jo decidedly 
 i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own 
 a mercy you mother laughed jo looking at her boots but have another play sometime that he can see perhaps help act that be jolly 
 i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest 
 they are lovely but roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the posy in her belt 
 beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father afraid he having such a merry christmas as we are

 deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks rows upon rows of towering 
 bookshelves filled with literature on the antiquities standing at the top 
 of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the 
 bookshelves is a rather uninteresting british girl 
 long boring dress your typical prudish nightmare this is 
 evelyn carnarvon going to fall in love with her 
 evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows the dust off it 
 then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the 
 letter o then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads 
 the title 
 evelyn 
 tuthmosis now how did you get up here 
 carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her shoulder to 
 the bookshelf behind her where all the titles begin with the letter to 
 then she looks down a long way to the bottom evelyn gently sets the 
 other books down on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
 across the aisle with the tuthmosis book a little too far so she 
 stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder with 
 her fingertips almost got it closer now closer 
 and when the ladder pulls away from the shelf evelyn yelps flings 
 the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder which stands straight 
 up evelyn holds her breath swaying precariously a long beat and then

 out into the main aisle and picks up speed evelyn screams as it does a 
 spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
 bookshelf evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily 
 and when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes into the next 
 bookshelf evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor she looks 
 up just as the domino effect each bookshelf crashing into the 
 next and onward it goes bookshelf after bookshelf thousands of volumes 
 flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor it finally ends as

 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her

 lester looks up her sheepishly then at carolyn 
 his pov she looks down at us slightly contemptuous but alsobored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago 
 lesteri keep meaning to get this thing fixed 
 he smiles trying to lighten the moment but expression change she opens the door and gets into the drivers seat jane takes the passenger seat and lester climbs into the back the ml starts to slowly back out of the driveway 
 lester my family and this is my think i miss it so much 
 int ml a short time later 
 carolyn is driving jane stares out the window lester is asleep in the back seat clint black sings desperado on the stereo 
 janewhy are we listening to this music 
 just what was on 
 jane fiddles the tuner searching for another suddenly catches eye 
 her pov an advertisement on a bus stop bench shows a silver man smiling a toothy smile it reads leonard kane the real estate king highest sales record three years straight we recognize him as the man seated next to carolyn in court during trial 
 carolyn glare at the advertisement as she drives past itobviously bothers her 
 janei see how you people can listen to that hillbilly crap it makes me want to buy a gun and shoot up a burger king

 jane finally finds a station she likes moody alternativerock they drive along without speaking for a moment then 
 janewake up dad here 
 no response from lester 
 jane look garth brooks and wearing that groovy cowboy hat maybe you can get his autograph 
 hush 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 lester sits in the crowded train his head up against thewindow fast asleep 
 lester my wife and my daughter think this gigantic loser 
 he has a paper cup of coffee in one hand haphazardly holdingit against his knee slowly it tips over spilling onto his pants leg he remains asleep 
 lester right lost something very important not exactly sure what it is but i know i always fell this sedated 
 finally lester opens one eye 
 pov from the front of the path train zooming along aboveground unnaturally fast heading toward a tunnel 
 lester you know what never too late to get it back 
 and we accelerate into the tunnel and blackness 
 int office building dayclose on a computer monitor scrolling copy moving by too quickly for us to read but we can make out words here and there marketing profits strategy etc 
 lester sits at his workstation in a beige cubicle surrounded by several identical beige cubicles staring at the monitor and talking on a headset phone the light friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered expression on his face 
 
 lesterhello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine calling for actually already left a message about four messages to be exact i understand but i have questions about the new product launch that your press release quite cover 
 brad an affable man in his early thirties appears behindlester lester is immediately aware of his presence 
 lester already given you my yes lester burnham thank you 
 he punches a button on his keyboard then turns to brad smiling perfunctorily 
 bradles got a minute 
 lesterfor you brad got five 
 bradgood why we talk in my smiles and crosses off lester watches him go frowning 
 int office moments later 
 brad is seated behind his desk 
 sure you can understand the need to cut corners around here 
 lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager been sent to the office 
 lestersure times are tight and you need to free up cash gotta spend money to make money 
 bradexactly 
 brad stands ready to usher lester out but lester remainsseated 
 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him 
 bradjesus calm down getting fired yet why having everyone write a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute that way management can assess valuable and 
 lesterexpendable 
 just business 
 been writing for this magazine for fourteen years brad been here how long a month 
 one of the good guys les i trying to level with you this is your one chance to save your job 
 lester leans back in his chair incredulous 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 once again lester sits in the crowded train his head upagainst the window but this time not asleep he glares darkly out at the tunnel walls as they fly by 
 ext burnham house that night 
 the ml pulls into the driveway driven bycarolyn a moving van is parked in front of the pale blue colonial house next door a couple of movers carry a couch down the driveway toward the house 
 as lester and carolyn get out of the ml and head towardtheir front door 
 carolynthere is no decision just write the damn thing 
 lesteryou think weird and kinda fascist 
 carolynpossibly but you want to be unemployed 
 lester 
 oh okay all sell our sols to satan because more convenient that way 
 you be just a little bit more dramatic please 
 carolyn scopes out the moving van next door 
 carolyn finally got new neighbors about time if the lomans had let me represent them instead real estate king that house would have sold within a week instead of sitting on the market for six months 
 lesterthey were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore 
 carolyntheir sycamore it was on our property 
 int burnham house dining room later that night 
 we hear john coltrane and johnny rendition of you are too beautiful on the stereo 
 lester carolyn and jane are seated at dinner in the formaldining room they eat by candlelight and a profusion of red roses spills from a vase at the center of the table we circle them slowly as they eat nobody makes eye contact or even seems aware of anybody presence until 
 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music 
 no we as soon as prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that about to eat you can listen to whatever you like 
 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school 
 was okay 
 lesterjust okay 
 janeno dad it was beat 
 lesterwant to know how things went at my job 
 now she looks at him as if lost his mind 
 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely 
 what do you expect you all of a sudden be my best friend just because got a problem 
 she gets up and heads toward the kitchen 
 jane mean hello barely even spoken to me for months 
 gone lester notices carolyn looking at him critically 
 lesteroh what you treat her like a employee 
 
 he gets up and starts after jane 
 lesteryou treat us both like employees 
 carolyn looks after him 
 int burnham house continuous 
 a huge faux industrial kitchen with whiteceramic tile brushed steel appliances and antique hardware and lighting this is one of those designer kitchens that cost a fortune jane stands at the sink rinsing off her plate lester enters 
 lesterhoney sorry i 
 jane turns and stares at him waiting for him to finish 
 lester sorry i been more available i just 
 looking to her for a little help here but too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any 
 lester know you always have to wait for me to come to you 
 great so now my fault 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 on video looking at lester and jane through greenhouse windows into the kitchen we hear what saying but obvious not going well jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves we follow her out the door then the camera jerks back to lester calling after her 
 close on the lens of a portable video camera as wepull back the camera drops down to reveal ricky fitts whom we recognize as the young man in jail at the beginning his short hair and starched clothes give him a appearance we linger on his placid face for a moment then 
 int burnham kitchen continuous 
 lester stands at the sink rinsing off his plate his facedark his head suddenly jerks up and he looks out the window as if he realizes he s being watched 
 his pov looking at the pint where ricky was just standing but no longer there 
 lester frowns then turns off the faucet grabs a towel anddries his hands he tosses the towel on the snack bar on his way out where it lands next to a framed photograph 
 we zoom slowly toward the photograph of lester carolyn and a jane taken several years earlier at an amusement park starling how happy they look

 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him 
 bradjesus calm down getting fired yet why having everyone write a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute that way management can assess valuable and 
 lesterexpendable 
 just business 
 been writing for this magazine for fourteen years brad been here how long a month 
 one of the good guys les i trying to level with you this is your one chance to save your job 
 lester leans back in his chair incredulous 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 once again lester sits in the crowded train his head upagainst the window but this time not asleep he glares darkly out at the tunnel walls as they fly by 
 ext burnham house that night 
 the ml pulls into the driveway driven bycarolyn a moving van is parked in front of the pale blue colonial house next door a couple of movers carry a couch down the driveway toward the house 
 as lester and carolyn get out of the ml and head towardtheir front door 
 carolynthere is no decision just write the damn thing 
 lesteryou think weird and kinda fascist 
 carolynpossibly but you want to be unemployed 
 lester 
 oh okay all sell our sols to satan because more convenient that way 
 you be just a little bit more dramatic please 
 carolyn scopes out the moving van next door 
 carolyn finally got new neighbors about time if the lomans had let me represent them instead real estate king that house would have sold within a week instead of sitting on the market for six months 
 lesterthey were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore 
 carolyntheir sycamore it was on our property 
 int burnham house dining room later that night 
 we hear john coltrane and johnny rendition of you are too beautiful on the stereo 
 lester carolyn and jane are seated at dinner in the formaldining room they eat by candlelight and a profusion of red roses spills from a vase at the center of the table we circle them slowly as they eat nobody makes eye contact or even seems aware of anybody presence until 
 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music 
 no we as soon as prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that about to eat you can listen to whatever you like 
 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school 
 was okay 
 lesterjust okay 
 janeno dad it was beat 
 lesterwant to know how things went at my job 
 now she looks at him as if lost his mind 
 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely 
 what do you expect you all of a sudden be my best friend just because got a problem 
 she gets up and heads toward the kitchen 
 jane mean hello barely even spoken to me for months 
 gone lester notices carolyn looking at him critically 
 lesteroh what you treat her like a employee 
 
 he gets up and starts after jane 
 lesteryou treat us both like employees 
 carolyn looks after him 
 int burnham house continuous 
 a huge faux industrial kitchen with whiteceramic tile brushed steel appliances and antique hardware and lighting this is one of those designer kitchens that cost a fortune jane stands at the sink rinsing off her plate lester enters 
 lesterhoney sorry i 
 jane turns and stares at him waiting for him to finish 
 lester sorry i been more available i just 
 looking to her for a little help here but too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any 
 lester know you always have to wait for me to come to you 
 great so now my fault 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 on video looking at lester and jane through greenhouse windows into the kitchen we hear what saying but obvious not going well jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves we follow her out the door then the camera jerks back to lester calling after her 
 close on the lens of a portable video camera as wepull back the camera drops down to reveal ricky fitts whom we recognize as the young man in jail at the beginning his short hair and starched clothes give him a appearance we linger on his placid face for a moment then 
 int burnham kitchen continuous 
 lester stands at the sink rinsing off his plate his facedark his head suddenly jerks up and he looks out the window as if he realizes he s being watched 
 his pov looking at the pint where ricky was just standing but no longer there 
 lester frowns then turns off the faucet grabs a towel anddries his hands he tosses the towel on the snack bar on his way out where it lands next to a framed photograph 
 we zoom slowly toward the photograph of lester carolyn and a jane taken several years earlier at an amusement park starling how happy they look
