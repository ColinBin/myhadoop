 if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever foranything else either with or without life let him give and receivethem genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law and let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes ofour other laws every man should regard adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right but they leave the occasion and the when and thewhere undefined and unsettled and from this want of definitenessin their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers now a legislator ought not to leave the matter ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less let thisbe the rule one shall call the gods to witness when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to them and he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the nextdegree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors nowbetter men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders arethe superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiorsof their off spring and men of women and children and rulers oftheir subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in anyposition of authority and especially those who are in stateoffices and this is the reason why i have spoken of these every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells afalsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does butswear without any respect for god or man certainly it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods afterthe fashion of men in general who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions but if a man will not conform tothis rule let the law be as who sells anything in theagora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shallask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away hisgoods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present notbeing less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them if a mansells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations hewho knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence ofthe magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have theadulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue thecharge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the godsof the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate thegoods to the gods of the agora he who is proved to have sold anyadulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shallbe beaten with stripe for a drachma according to theprice of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten the warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers andshall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors ofthose who have business in the agora enough has been said in what haspreceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to bewanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and writedown the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laiddown for them about their office 
 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them 
 cle and what do you call the true mode of service 
 ath i will tell you o my friend for such things are worthlistening to 
 cle proceed 
 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods

 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever foranything else either with or without life let him give and receivethem genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law and let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes ofour other laws every man should regard adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right but they leave the occasion and the when and thewhere undefined and unsettled and from this want of definitenessin their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers now a legislator ought not to leave the matter ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less let thisbe the rule one shall call the gods to witness when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to them and he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the nextdegree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors nowbetter men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders arethe superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiorsof their off spring and men of women and children and rulers oftheir subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in anyposition of authority and especially those who are in stateoffices and this is the reason why i have spoken of these every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells afalsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does butswear without any respect for god or man certainly it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods afterthe fashion of men in general who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions but if a man will not conform tothis rule let the law be as who sells anything in theagora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shallask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away hisgoods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present notbeing less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them if a mansells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations hewho knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence ofthe magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have theadulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue thecharge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the godsof the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate thegoods to the gods of the agora he who is proved to have sold anyadulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shallbe beaten with stripe for a drachma according to theprice of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten the warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers andshall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors ofthose who have business in the agora enough has been said in what haspreceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to bewanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and writedown the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laiddown for them about their office 
 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them

 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods

 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our cityto any other or bring back a false message from the city to whichhe is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends orenemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have neversaid let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and letthere be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted 
 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations

 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will

 if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our cityto any other or bring back a false message from the city to whichhe is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends orenemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have neversaid let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and letthere be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted 
 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations 
 when a man becomes surety let him give the security in a distinctform acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document andin the presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under athousand drachmae and of not less than five witnesses if the sum beabove a thousand drachmae the agent of a dishonest or untrustworthyseller shall himself be responsible both the agent and theprincipal shall be equally liable if a person wishes to find anythingin the house of another he shall enter naked or wearing only a shorttunic and without a girdle having first taken an oath by thecustomary gods that he expects to find it there he shall then makehis search and the other shall throw open his house and allow himto search things both sealed and unsealed and if a person will notallow the searcher to make his search he who is prevented shall go tolaw with him estimating the value of the goods after which he issearching and if the other be convicted he shall pay twice thevalue of the article if the master be absent from home thedwellers in the house shall let him search the unsealed on the sealed property the searcher shall set another seal andshall appoint any one whom he likes to guard them during five if the master of the house be absent during a longer time heshall take with him the wardens of the city and so make his the sealed property as well as the unsealed and with the members of the family and the wardens of the shall seal them up again as they were before there shall be alimit of time in the case of disputed things and he who has hadpossession of them during a certain time shall no longer be liableto be disturbed as to houses and lands there can be no dispute inthis state of ours but if a man has any other possessions which hehas used and openly shown in the city and in the agora and in thetemples and no one has put in a claim to them and some one says thathe was looking for them during this time and the possessor isproved to have made no concealment if they have continued for a one having the goods and the other looking for them the claimof the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the if he does not use or show the lost property in the market or inthe city but only in the country and no one offers himself as theowner during five years at the expiration of the five years the claimshall be barred for ever after or if he uses them in the city butwithin the house then the appointed time of claiming the goodsshall be three years or ten years if he has them in the country inprivate and if he has them in another land there shall be no limitof time or prescription but whenever the owner finds them he mayclaim them

 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will 
 
 the end
