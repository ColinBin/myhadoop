 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon

 book iv 
 
 adeimantus socrates 
 here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard 
 yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same nature might be added 
 but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge 
 you mean to ask i said what will be our answer 
 yes 
 if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two is the happier at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state suppose that we were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful and so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they like and no more our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as much as they like in this way we might make every class then as you imagine the whole state would be happy but do not put this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the state now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly and not real guardians then see how they turn the state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state we mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state but if so we mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not a state and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state as a whole but the latter be the truth then the guardians and auxillaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best way and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them 
 i think that you are quite right 
 i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me 
 what may that be 
 there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts 
 what are they 
 wealth i said and poverty 
 how do they act 
 the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any longer take the same pains with his art 
 certainly not 
 he will grow more and more indolent and careless 
 very true 
 and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter 
 yes he greatly deteriorates 
 but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well 
 certainly not 
 then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate 
 that is evident 
 here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved 
 what evils 
 wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent 
 that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war 
 there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them 
 how so he asked 
 in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men 
 that is true he said 
 and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and gentlemen who were not boxers 
 hardly if they came upon him at once 
 what not i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up and supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one stout personage 
 certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that 
 and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities 
 likely enough 
 then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number 
 i agree with you for i think you right 
 and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war of and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather th than with the dogs on their side against fat and tender sheep 
 that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one 
 but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own 
 why so 
 you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a city but many cities as they say in the game for indeed any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all as a single state but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies and your state while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders a single state which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and many times greater 
 that is most true he said 
 and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to include and beyond which they will not go 
 what limit would you propose 
 i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i think is the proper limit 
 very good he said 
 here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and 
 and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them 
 and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter still i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior the intention was that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many 
 yes he said that is not so difficult 
 the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a thing however which i would rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose 
 what may that be he asked 
 education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says 
 that will be the best way of settling them 
 also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force like a wheel for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals 
 very possibly he said 
 then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form and no innovation made they must do their utmost to maintain them intact and when any one says that mankind most regard 
 the newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibited so damon tells me and i can quite believe says that when modes of music change of the state always change with them 
 yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to and your own 
 then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music 
 yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in 
 yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears harmless 
 why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public 
 is that true i said 
 that is my belief he replied 
 then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become lawless they can never grow up into and virtuous citizens 
 very true he said 
 and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places a principle in the state will raise them up again 
 very true he said 
 thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their predecessors have altogether neglected 
 what do you mean 
 i mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general you would agree with me 
 yes 
 but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such matters i doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them likely to be lasting 
 impossible 
 it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life does not like always attract like 
 to be sure 
 until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be the reverse of good 
 that is not to be denied 
 and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about them 
 naturally enough he replied 
 well and about the business of the agora dealings and the ordinary dealings between man and man or again about agreements with the commencement with artisans about insult and injury of the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you say there may also arise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations of markets police harbours and the like but oh heavens shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars 
 i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves 
 yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them 
 and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection 
 you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no will not leave off their habits of intemperance 
 exactly 
 yes i said and what a delightful life they lead they are always doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try 
 such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort 
 yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail 
 charming he replied i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man who tells you what is right 
 these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces 
 assuredly not 
 nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was just now describing for are there not states in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these states resemble the persons whom i was describing 
 yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising them 
 but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption 
 yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired 
 what do you mean i said you should have more feeling for them when a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say 
 nay he said certainly not in that case 
 well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra 
 yes he said that is just what they are doing 
 i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an or in a state for in the former they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations 
 what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation 
 nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all 
 which are they he said 
 the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants of the world below these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity he is the god who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind 
 you are right and we will do as you propose 
 but where amid all this is justice son of ariston tell me where now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates glaucon 
 nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety 
 i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join 
 we will he replied 
 well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect 
 that is most certain 
 and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just 
 that is likewise clear 
 and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not found will be the residue 
 very good 
 if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left 
 very true he said 
 and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also four in number 
 clearly 
 first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this i detect a certain peculiarity 
 what is that 
 the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel 
 very true 
 and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by knowledge do men counsel well 
 clearly 
 and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse 
 of course 
 there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel 
 certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering 
 then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements 
 certainly not 
 nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as possessing any other similar knowledge 
 not by reason of any of them he said 
 nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give the city the name of agricultural 
 yes 
 well i said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded state among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and with other states 
 there certainly is 
 and what is knowledge and among whom is it found i asked 
 it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians 
 and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge 
 the name of good in counsel and truly wise 
 and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths 
 the smiths he replied will be far more numerous 
 will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge 
 much the smallest 
 and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least 
 most true 
 thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered 
 and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied 
 again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state 
 how do you mean 
 why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the behalf 
 no one he replied would ever think of any other 
 certainly not 
 the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the city either the one or the other 
 the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what you term courage 
 i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i perfectly understand you 
 i mean that courage is a kind of salvation 
 salvation of what 
 of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose this opinion shall i give you an illustration 
 if you please 
 you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom but when the ground has not been duly prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour 
 yes he said i know that they have a and ridiculous appearance 
 then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other solvents and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless you disagree 
 but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have another name 
 most certainly 
 then i may infer courage to be such as you describe 
 why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough 
 you are right he replied 
 two virtues remain to be discovered in the temperance and then justice which is the end of our search 
 very true 
 now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance 
 i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first 
 certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request 
 then consider he said 
 yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding 
 how so he asked 
 temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in language 
 no doubt he said 
 there is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted 
 certainly 
 the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled 
 yes there is reason in that 
 and now i said look at our newly created state and there you will find one of these two conditions realised for the state as you will acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and truly express the rule of the better part over the worse 
 yes he said i see that what you say is true 
 let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class 
 certainly he said 
 whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the best born and best educated 
 very true these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few 
 that i perceive he said 
 then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation 
 certainly he replied 
 it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons 
 yes 
 and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule that again will be our state 
 undoubtedly 
 and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects 
 in both as i should imagine he replied 
 do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony 
 why so 
 why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything else most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in states and individuals 
 i entirely agree with you 
 and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been discovered in our state the last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was 
 the inference is obvious 
 the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know 
 would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about as much as i am good for 
 offer up a prayer with me and follow 
 i will but you must show me the way 
 here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on 
 let us push on 
 here i saw something halloo i said i begin to perceive a track and i believe that the quarry will not escape 
 good news he said 
 truly i said we are stupid fellows 
 why so 
 why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more ridiculous like people who go about looking for what they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we missed her 
 what do you mean 
 i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her 
 i grow impatient at the length of your exordium 
 well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle or a part of it 
 yes we often said that one man should do one thing only 
 further we affirmed that justice was doing own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us 
 yes we said so 
 then to do own business in a certain way may be assumed to be justice can you tell me whence i derive this inference 
 i cannot but i should like to be told 
 because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one 
 that follows of necessity 
 if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subject the quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the palm the question is not so easily answered 
 certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which 
 then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage 
 yes he said 
 and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice 
 exactly 
 let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law 
 certainly 
 and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is nor be deprived of what is his own 
 yes that is their principle 
 which is a just principle 
 yes 
 then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a own and belongs to him 
 very true 
 think now and say whether you agree with me or not suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm would result to the state 
 not much 
 but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the state 
 most true 
 seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the state and may be most justly termed 
 precisely 
 and the greatest degree of to own city would be termed by you injustice 
 certainly 
 this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the city just 
 i agree with you 
 we will not i said be as yet but if on trial this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh enquiry first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state justice would be found let the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another trial of the theory the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls 
 that will be in regular course let us do as you say 
 i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same 
 like he replied 
 the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just state 
 he will 
 and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes 
 true he said 
 and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner 
 certainly he said 
 once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not 
 an easy question nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the good 
 very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is another and a longer one still we may arrive at a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry 
 may we not be satisfied with that he said under the circumstances i am quite content 
 i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied 
 then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said 
 must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the individual they pass into the state how else can they come there take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it the thracians scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians 
 exactly so he said 
 there is no difficulty in understanding this 
 none whatever 
 but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine that is the difficulty 
 yes he said there lies the difficulty 
 then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different 
 how can we he asked 
 i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really not the same but different 
 good 
 for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part 
 impossible 
 still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should hereafter fall out by the way imagine the case of a man who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest 
 very true 
 and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest 
 that is the correct mode of describing them he replied 
 then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways 
 certainly not according to my way of thinking 
 yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn 
 yes he said that will be the best way 
 well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded as active or passive for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition 
 yes he said they are opposites 
 well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes already mentioned you would say would you not that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind longing for the realisation of his desires intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question 
 very true 
 and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection 
 certainly 
 admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they are termed which are the most obvious of them 
 let us take that class he said 
 the object of one is food and of the other drink 
 yes 
 and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger 
 yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object 
 but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is true of every other desire 
 yes he replied the opponent might have something to say 
 nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their correlatives simple 
 i do not know what you mean 
 well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less 
 certainly 
 and the much greater to the much less 
 yes 
 and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be 
 certainly he said 
 and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is not this true of all of them 
 yes 
 and does not the same principle hold in the sciences the object of science is knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that the science of is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture 
 certainly 
 because it has a particular quality which no other has 
 yes 
 and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences 
 yes 
 now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning in what i said about relatives my meaning was that if one term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other is also qualified i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine 
 i quite understand and i think as you do 
 would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms having clearly a relation 
 yes thirst is relative to drink 
 and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only 
 certainly 
 then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it 
 that is plain 
 and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same 
 impossible 
 no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls 
 exactly so he replied 
 and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink 
 yes he said it constantly happens 
 and in such a case what is one to say would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him 
 i should say so 
 and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease 
 clearly 
 then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one another the one with which man reasons we may call the rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions 
 yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different 
 then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to one of the preceding 
 i should be inclined to say akin to desire 
 well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i put faith the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution he felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight 
 i have heard the story myself he said 
 the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as though they were two distinct things 
 yes that is the meaning he said 
 and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one else 
 certainly not 
 suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them 
 true he said 
 but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more 
 the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are their shepherds 
 i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which i wish you to consider 
 what point 
 you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle 
 most assuredly 
 but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason 
 yes he said there must be a third 
 yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from desire turn out also to be different from reason 
 but that is easily proved we may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough 
 excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying and we may once more appeal to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us 
 he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it 
 very true he said 
 and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and that they are three in number 
 exactly 
 must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise 
 certainly 
 also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues 
 assuredly 
 and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the state is just 
 that follows of course 
 we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class 
 we are not very likely to have forgotten he said 
 we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work 
 yes he said we must remember that too 
 and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally 
 certainly 
 and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm 
 quite true he said 
 and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her subjects and overturn the whole life of man 
 very true he said 
 both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and counsels 
 true 
 and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear 
 right he replied 
 and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole 
 assuredly 
 and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule and do not rebel 
 certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state or individual 
 and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just 
 that is very certain 
 and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she the same which we found her to be in the state 
 there is no difference in my opinion he said 
 because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying 
 what sort of instances do you mean 
 if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver would any one deny this 
 no one he replied 
 will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery either to his friends or to his country 
 never 
 neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements 
 impossible 
 no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and mother or to fall in his religious duties 
 no one 
 and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in ruling or being ruled 
 exactly so 
 are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice or do you hope to discover some other 
 not i indeed 
 then our dream has been realised and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified 
 yes certainly 
 and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use 
 clearly 
 but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that which preserves and with this harmonious condition just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance 
 you have said the exact truth socrates 
 very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling a falsehood 
 most certainly not 
 may we say so then 
 let us say so 
 and now i said injustice has to be considered 
 clearly 
 must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every form of vice 
 exactly so 
 and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly clear 
 what do you mean he said 
 why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what disease and health are in the body 
 how so he said 
 why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy causes disease 
 yes 
 and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice 
 that is certain 
 and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order 
 true 
 and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order 
 exactly so he said 
 then virtue is the health and beauty and of the soul and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same 
 true 
 and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice 
 assuredly 
 still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed 
 in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous we know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both to be such as we have described 
 yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous still as we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes let us not faint by the way 
 certainly not he replied 
 come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i mean which are worth looking at 
 i am following you he replied proceed 
 i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are deserving of note 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there are distinct forms of the state 
 how many 
 there are five of the state and five of the soul i said 
 what are they 
 the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many 
 true he replied 
 but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be maintained 
 that is true he replied

 book v 
 
 socrates glaucon adeimantus 
 such is the good and true city or state and the good and man is of the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms 
 what are they he said 
 i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another when pole marchus who was sitting a little way off just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what shall we do 
 certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice 
 who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off 
 you he said 
 i repeated why am i especially not to be let off 
 why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were to everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all things in common 
 and was i not right adeimantus 
 yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds please therefore to say what sort of community you mean we have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of women and we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil and now since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all this 
 to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed 
 socrates adeimantus glaucon thrasymachus 
 and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally agreed 
 i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument are you raising about the state just as i thought that i had finished and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation ignorant of what a nest of words you are stirring now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it 
 for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said thrasymachus to look for gold or to hear discourse 
 yes but discourse should have a limit 
 yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians and how shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care tell us how these things will be 
 yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions for the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should turn out to be a dream only 
 fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not sceptical or hostile 
 i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words 
 yes he said 
 then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at of which the fear would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage me 
 glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak 
 well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument 
 then why should you mind 
 well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place the part of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women of them i will proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you 
 for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd 
 true 
 let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design 
 what do you mean 
 what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them 
 no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker 
 but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred and fed in the same way 
 you cannot 
 then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same nurture and education 
 yes 
 the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic yes 
 then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which they must practise like the men 
 that is the inference i suppose 
 i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous 
 no doubt of it 
 yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia 
 yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be thought ridiculous 
 but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation how they will talk of attainments both in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback 
 very true he replied 
 yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious not long ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation 
 no doubt 
 but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good 
 very true he replied 
 first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion 
 that will be much the best way 
 shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in this manner the position will not be undefended 
 why not he said 
 then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents they will say socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature and certainly if i am not mistaken such an admission was made by us and do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed and we shall reply of course they do then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different natures certainly they should but if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different ought to perform the same actions what defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these objections 
 that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side 
 these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children 
 by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy 
 why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into he has to swim all the same 
 very true 
 and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us 
 i suppose so he said 
 well then let us see if any way of escape can be found we acknowledged did we not that different natures ought to have different pursuits and that and natures are different and now what are we saying that different natures ought to have the same pursuits this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us 
 precisely 
 verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction 
 why do you say so 
 because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion 
 yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us and our argument 
 a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition 
 in what way 
 why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures 
 why no he said that was never considered by us 
 i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely 
 that would be a jest he said 
 yes i said a jest and why because we never meant when we constructed the state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature 
 true 
 whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures 
 certainly 
 and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits 
 very true he said 
 next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man 
 that will be quite fair 
 and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty 
 yes perhaps 
 suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the state 
 by all means 
 let us say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other is a hindrance to not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted 
 no one will deny that 
 and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female need i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd 
 you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on the whole what you say is true 
 and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man 
 very true 
 then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women 
 that will never do 
 one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another has no music in her nature 
 very true 
 and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics 
 certainly 
 and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has spirit and another is without spirit 
 that is also true 
 then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort 
 yes 
 men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness 
 obviously 
 and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character 
 very true 
 and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits 
 they ought 
 then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point we come round again 
 certainly not 
 the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature 
 that appears to be true 
 we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly whether they were the most beneficial 
 yes 
 and the possibility has been acknowledged 
 yes 
 the very great benefit has next to be established 
 quite so 
 you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same 
 yes 
 i should like to ask you a question 
 what is it 
 would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than another 
 the latter 
 and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling 
 what a ridiculous question 
 you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens 
 by far the best 
 and will not their wives be the best women 
 yes by far the best 
 and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible 
 there can be nothing better 
 and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner as we have described will accomplish 
 certainly 
 then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the state 
 true 
 then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives in his laughter he is plucking 
 a fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base 
 very true 
 here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness 
 yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped 
 yes i said but a greater is coming you will of this when you see the next 
 go on let me see 
 the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own child nor any child his parent 
 yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable 
 i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite another matter and will be very much disputed 
 i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both 
 you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied now i meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility 
 but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a defence of both 
 well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a little favour let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for much now i myself am beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over the question of possibility at present assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians first of all then if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility 
 i have no objection proceed 
 first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to their care 
 that is right he said 
 you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select the women and give them to them they must be as far as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common meals none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic exercises and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word i think 
 yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind 
 true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing which the rulers will forbid 
 yes he said and it ought not to be permitted 
 then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred 
 exactly 
 and how can marriages be made most beneficial that is a question which i put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler sort of birds not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding 
 in what particulars 
 why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some better than others 
 true 
 and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from the best only 
 from the best 
 and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age 
 i choose only those of ripe age 
 and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate 
 certainly 
 and the same of horses and animals in general 
 undoubtedly 
 good heavens my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species 
 certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular skill 
 because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines now you know that when patients do not require medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor should be more of a man 
 that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding 
 i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage 
 and we were very right 
 and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations of marriages and births 
 how so 
 why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in condition now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion 
 very true 
 had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average of population there are many other things which they will have to consider such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small 
 certainly he replied 
 we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse their own and not the rulers 
 to be sure he said 
 and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as possible 
 true 
 and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be held by women as well as by men 
 yes 
 the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as they should be 
 yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure 
 they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother recognizes her own child and other may be engaged if more are required care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants 
 you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they are having children 
 why said i and so they ought let us however proceed with our scheme we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life 
 very true 
 and what is the prime of life may it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a life and thirty in a 
 which years do you mean to include 
 a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be 
 certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour 
 any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust 
 very true he replied 
 and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state uncertified and unconsecrated 
 very true he replied 
 this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his daughter or his daughter or his mother or his mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons or fathers or son or father and so on in either direction and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly 
 that also he said is a reasonable proposition but how will they know who are fathers and daughters and so on 
 they will never know the way will be this dating from the day of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers all who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as i was saying will be forbidden to this however is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle the law will allow them 
 quite right he replied 
 such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are to have their wives and families in common and now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would you not 
 yes certainly 
 shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a state what is the greatest i good and what is the greatest evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil 
 by all means 
 can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign or any greater good than the bond of unity 
 there cannot 
 and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow 
 no doubt 
 yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens 
 certainly 
 such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the terms mine and not mine his and not his 
 exactly so 
 and is not that the state in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to the same thing 
 quite true 
 or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering 
 very true he replied and i agree with you that in the state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe 
 then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him 
 yes he said that is what will happen in a state 
 it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles 
 very good 
 our state like every other has rulers and subjects 
 true 
 all of whom will call one another citizens 
 of course 
 but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other states 
 generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call them rulers 
 and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers 
 they are called saviours and helpers he replied 
 and what do the rulers call the people 
 their maintainers and 
 and what do they call them in other states 
 slaves 
 and what do the rulers call one another in other states 
 
 and what in ours 
 
 did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend 
 yes very often 
 and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest 
 exactly 
 but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger 
 certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him 
 capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name for example in the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of god or of man are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk 
 these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them 
 then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often beard than in any other as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well or it is ill 
 most true 
 and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common 
 yes and so they will 
 and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call my own and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain 
 yes far more so than in other states 
 and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children 
 that will be the chief reason 
 and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied in our own comparison of a state to the relation of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain 
 that we acknowledged and very rightly 
 then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the state 
 certainly 
 and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians 
 right he replied 
 both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards a common end 
 certainly he replied 
 and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion 
 of course they will 
 neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of necessity 
 that is good he said 
 yes and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to more dangerous lengths 
 certainly 
 to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger 
 clearly 
 nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight him in any way for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers sons one wi fathers 
 that is true he replied 
 then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another 
 yes there will be no want of peace 
 and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another 
 none whatever 
 i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of 
 yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that 
 and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed 
 how so 
 the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and after death have an honourable burial 
 yes he said and glorious rewards they are 
 do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular class but of the whole 
 yes i remember 
 and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olympic victors is the life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it 
 certainly not 
 at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole 
 if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you have the offer of such a life 
 you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education common children and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the men and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the natural relation of the sexes 
 i agree with you he replied 
 the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found possible as among other animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible 
 you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest 
 there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them 
 how 
 why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the child they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers did you never observe in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel 
 yes i have 
 and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be 
 the idea is ridiculous he said 
 there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour 
 that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as their parents and the state will never recover 
 true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk 
 i am far from saying that 
 well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it 
 clearly 
 whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be incurred 
 yes very important 
 this then must be our first step to make our children spectators of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all will be well 
 true 
 their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous 
 that may be assumed 
 and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones 
 true 
 and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers 
 very properly 
 still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of chance about them 
 true 
 then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be had in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape 
 i believe that you are right he said 
 next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan what do you think 
 by all means i should say 
 and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with him 
 certainly 
 but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him in the first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown him what do you say 
 i approve 
 and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship 
 to that too i agree 
 but you will hardly agree to my next proposal 
 what is your proposal 
 that he should kiss and be kissed by them 
 most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour 
 capital i said that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others in order that he may have as many children as possible 
 agreed 
 again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing 
 most true he said 
 then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we were mentioning also with 
 seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them 
 that he replied is excellent 
 yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the first place that he is of the golden race 
 to be sure 
 nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead 
 they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil the guardians of men 
 yes and we accept his authority 
 we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids 
 by all means 
 and in ages to come we will reverence them and knee before their sepulchres as at the graves of heroes and not only they but any who are deemed good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours 
 that is very right he said 
 next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies what about this 
 in what respect do you mean 
 first of all in regard to slavery do you think it right that hellenes should enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians 
 to spare them is infinitely better 
 then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe 
 certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another 
 next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their armour does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder 
 very true 
 and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead 
 very like a dog he said 
 then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial 
 yes he replied we most certainly must 
 neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself 
 very true 
 again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses what is to be the practice 
 may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion 
 both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and no more shall i tell you why 
 pray do 
 why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and only the second war 
 that is a very proper distinction he replied 
 and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the barbarians 
 very good he said 
 and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called discord 
 i agree 
 consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever 
 yes he said that is a better temper than the other 
 and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city 
 it ought to be he replied 
 then will not the citizens be good and civilized 
 yes very civilized 
 and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land and share in the common temples 
 most certainly 
 and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war 
 certainly not 
 then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled certainly 
 they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their opponents they will be correctors not enemies 
 just so 
 and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will they burn houses not even suppose that the whole population of a city men women and children are equally their enemies for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their friends and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction 
 i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another 
 then let us enact this law also for our they are neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses 
 agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these all our previous enactments are very good 
 but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside is such an order of things possible and how if at all for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state i will add what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the rest may be left 
 if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate 
 the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once 
 let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after justice and injustice 
 true he replied but what of that 
 i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men 
 the approximation will be enough 
 we are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might have an ideal we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact 
 true he said 
 would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed 
 he would be none the worse 
 well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state 
 to be sure 
 and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described 
 surely not he replied 
 that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions 
 what admissions 
 i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth what do you say 
 i agree 
 then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented i am sure that i should be contented will not you 
 yes i will 
 let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible 
 certainly he replied 
 i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one 
 what is it he said 
 now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words 
 proceed 
 i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race as i believe and then only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of day such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing 
 socrates what do you mean i would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be prepared by their fine wits and no mistake 
 you got me into the scrape i said 
 and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can only give you and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another that is all and now having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you are right 
 i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance and i think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders 
 then now for a definition he said 
 follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give you a satisfactory explanation 
 proceed 
 i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a lover if lie is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole 
 i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory 
 another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the of youth 
 if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i assent 
 and what do you say of lovers of wine do you not see them doing the same they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine 
 very good 
 and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have 
 exactly 
 once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole class or a part only 
 the whole 
 and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom only but of the whole 
 yes of the whole 
 and he who dislikes learnings especially in youth when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one 
 very true he said 
 whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher am i not right 
 glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name all the lovers of sights have a delight in learning and must therefore be included musical amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country that makes no difference they are there now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors of quite minor arts are philosophers 
 certainly not i replied they are only an imitation 
 he said who then are the true philosophers 
 those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth 
 that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean 
 to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make 
 what is the proposition 
 that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two 
 certainly 
 and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one 
 true again 
 and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same remark holds taken singly each of them one but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many very true 
 and this is the distinction which i draw between the practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers 
 how do you distinguish them he said 
 the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty 
 true he replied 
 few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this 
 very true 
 and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object 
 i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming 
 but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer or is he awake 
 he is wide awake 
 and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion 
 certainly 
 but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits 
 we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied 
 come then and let us think of something to say to him shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it but we should like to ask him a question does he who has knowledge know something or nothing you must answer for him 
 i answer that he knows something 
 something that is or is not 
 something that is for how can that which is not ever be known 
 and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly is utterly unknown 
 nothing can be more certain 
 good but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being 
 yes between them 
 and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to for that intermediate between being and there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if there be such 
 certainly 
 do we admit the existence of opinion 
 undoubtedly 
 as being the same with knowledge or another faculty 
 another faculty 
 then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties 
 yes 
 and knowledge is relative to being and knows being but before i proceed further i will make a division 
 what division 
 i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do sight and hearing for example i should call faculties have i clearly explained the class which i mean 
 yes i quite understand 
 then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and therefore the distinctions of fire colour and the like which enable me to discern the differences of some things do not apply to them in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and another result i call different would that be your way of speaking 
 yes 
 and will you be so very good as to answer one more question would you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it 
 certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties 
 and is opinion also a faculty 
 certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion 
 and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion 
 why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs 
 an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them 
 yes 
 then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or 
 that is certain 
 being is the sphere or of knowledge and knowledge is to know the nature of being 
 yes 
 and opinion is to have an opinion 
 yes 
 and do we know what we opine or is the of opinion the same as the of knowledge 
 nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same 
 then if being is the of knowledge something else must be the of opinion 
 yes something else 
 well then is the of opinion or rather how can there be an opinion at all about reflect when a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing 
 impossible 
 he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing 
 yes 
 and is not one thing but properly speaking nothing 
 true 
 of ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being knowledge 
 true he said 
 then opinion is not concerned either with being or with 
 not with either 
 and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge 
 that seems to be true 
 but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance 
 in neither 
 then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance 
 both and in no small degree 
 and also to be within and between them 
 yes 
 then you would infer that opinion is intermediate 
 no question 
 but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them 
 true 
 and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion 
 there has 
 then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and and cannot rightly be termed either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to its proper faculty the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean 
 true 
 this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that anything is one to him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which will not also be unholy 
 no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the same is true of the rest 
 and may not the many which are doubles be also halves doubles that is of one thing and halves of another 
 quite true 
 and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names 
 true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them 
 and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this 
 he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or or both or neither 
 then what will you do with them i said can they have a better place than between being and for they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than or more full of light and existence than being 
 that is quite true he said 
 thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure 
 we have 
 yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty 
 quite true 
 then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge 
 that is certain 
 but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know and not to have opinion only 
 neither can that be denied 
 the one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion the latter are the same as i dare say will remember who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty 
 yes i remember 
 shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them 
 i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true 
 but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom and not lovers of opinion 
 assuredly

 book vi 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view 
 i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened 
 i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider 
 and what is the next question he asked 
 surely i said the one which follows next in order inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our state 
 and how can we rightly answer that question 
 whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state let them be our guardians 
 very good 
 neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes 
 there can be no question of that 
 and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are unable as with a eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons i ask simply blind 
 truly he replied they are much in that condition 
 and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also know the very truth of each thing 
 there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect 
 suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences 
 by all means 
 in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained we must come to an understanding about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in the state 
 what do you mean 
 let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption 
 agreed 
 and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition 
 true 
 and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality which they should also possess 
 what quality 
 truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth 
 yes that may be safely affirmed of them 
 may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections 
 right he said 
 and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth 
 how can there be 
 can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood 
 never 
 the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him lies desire all truth 
 assuredly 
 but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel 
 true 
 he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasure i mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one 
 that is most certain 
 such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place in his character 
 very true 
 another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered 
 what is that 
 there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human 
 most true he replied 
 then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence think much of human life 
 he cannot 
 or can such an one account death fearful 
 no indeed 
 then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy 
 certainly not 
 or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean or a boaster or a he i say ever be unjust or hard in his dealings 
 impossible 
 then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical 
 true 
 there is another point which should be remarked 
 what point 
 whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress 
 certainly not 
 and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he not be an empty vessel 
 that is certain 
 labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation yes 
 then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory 
 certainly 
 and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion 
 undoubtedly 
 and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion 
 to proportion 
 then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything 
 certainly 
 well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have a full and perfect participation of being 
 they are absolutely necessary he replied 
 and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred 
 the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study 
 and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to these only you will entrust the state 
 socrates adeimantus 
 here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring for any one of us might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol 
 well and do you think that those who say so are wrong 
 i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion 
 hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right 
 then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them 
 you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable 
 yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all accustomed i suppose 
 i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having first chained up the noble senses with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the hands into their own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other people like or possibility of this union of authority with the art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true pilot be regarded will he not be called by them a prater a a 
 of course said adeimantus 
 then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you understand already 
 certainly 
 then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary 
 i will 
 say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them and 
 precisely so he said 
 for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which opinion i agreed 
 yes 
 and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained 
 true 
 then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other 
 by all means 
 and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the gentle and noble nature truth as you will remember was his leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy 
 yes that was said 
 well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance with present notions of him 
 certainly he said 
 and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till then will he cease from his travail 
 nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him 
 and will the love of a lie be any part of a nature will he not utterly hate a lie 
 he will 
 and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads 
 impossible 
 justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow after 
 true he replied 
 neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts and you objected that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher 
 exactly 
 and we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling i am speaking of those who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak 
 what are these corruptions he said 
 i will see if i can explain them to you every one will admit that a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men 
 rare indeed 
 and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures 
 what causes 
 in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and the rest of them every one of which praise worthy qualities and this is a most singular circumstance destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them 
 that is very singular he replied 
 then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength rank and great connections in the state you understand the sort of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect 
 i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about them 
 grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer appear strange to you 
 and how am i to do so he asked 
 why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than what is not 
 very true 
 there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is greater 
 certainly 
 and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are become bad do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil 
 there i think that you are right 
 and our philosopher follows the same is like a plant which having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power do you really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of are not the public who say these things the greatest of all sophists and do they not educate to perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own hearts 
 when is this accomplished he said 
 when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young heart as they say leap within him will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion or will he be carried away by the stream will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do and as they are such will he be 
 yes socrates necessity will compel him 
 and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been mentioned 
 what is that 
 the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their words are powerless 
 indeed they do and in right good earnest 
 now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest 
 none he replied 
 no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say 
 i quite assent he replied 
 then let me crave your assent also to a further observation 
 what are you going to say 
 why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is their wisdom i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator 
 indeed he would 
 and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing for when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is not obliged the necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good did you ever hear any of them which were not 
 no nor am i likely to hear 
 you recognise the truth of what i have been saying then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind 
 certainly not 
 then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher 
 impossible 
 and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world 
 they must 
 and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them 
 that is evident 
 then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end and remember what we were saying of him that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence these were admitted by us to be the true gifts 
 yes 
 will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones 
 certainly he said 
 and his friends and will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes 
 no question 
 falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he will one day possess 
 that often happens he said 
 and what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall proper youth will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride 
 to be sure he will 
 now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will be easily induced to listen 
 far otherwise 
 and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions 
 there can be no doubt of it 
 and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher 
 impossible 
 then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may if he be divert him from philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other goods of life 
 we were quite right 
 thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states 
 that is most true he said 
 and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment 
 that is certainly what people say 
 yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts for although philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts and many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts is not this unavoidable 
 yes 
 are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his daughter who is left poor and desolate 
 a most exact parallel 
 what will be the issue of such marriages will they not be vile and bastard 
 there can be no question of it 
 and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom 
 no doubt he said 
 then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant perchance some noble and person detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but kept him away from politics my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way he is like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and with bright hopes 
 yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs 
 a great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself 
 the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained the injustice of the charges against her has been there anything more which you wish to say 
 nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her 
 not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and receives another character but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or institutions are but human and now i know that you are going to ask what that state is 
 no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another question whether it is the state of which we are the founders and inventors or some other 
 yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before that some living authority would always be required in the state having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws 
 that was said he replied 
 yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy 
 what is there remaining 
 the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is the good as men say 
 still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be complete 
 i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit 
 in what manner 
 at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off in after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they never light up again 
 but what ought to be their course 
 just the opposite in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another 
 how truly in earnest you are socrates he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of all 
 do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state of existence 
 you are speaking of a time which is not very near 
 rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having a natural unity but a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did 
 no indeed 
 no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society 
 they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak 
 and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely inspired d with a true love of true philosophy that either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries am i not right 
 quite right 
 if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will be whenever the muse of philosophy is queen there is no impossibility in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves 
 my opinion agrees with yours he said 
 but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude 
 i should imagine not he replied 
 o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed if they view him in this new light they will surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain who can be at enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy nay let me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind 
 i quite agree with you he said 
 and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this 
 it is most unbecoming 
 for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform himself can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse 
 impossible 
 and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will suffer from detraction 
 of course 
 and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue 
 anything but unskilful 
 and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will they be angry with philosophy will they disbelieve us when we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern 
 they will not be angry if they understand he said but how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking 
 they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface this is no easy task but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them and every other legislator they will have nothing to do either with individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made a clean surface 
 they will be very right he said 
 having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution 
 no doubt 
 and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and thus they will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men homer calls the form and likeness of god 
 very true he said 
 and one feature they will erase and another they will put in they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god 
 indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture 
 and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard 
 much calmer if there is any sense in them 
 why where can they still find any ground for objection will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being 
 they would not be so unreasonable 
 or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest good 
 neither can they doubt this 
 but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was or will they prefer those whom we have rejected 
 surely not 
 then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our imaginary state ever be realised 
 i think that they will be less angry 
 shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot refuse to come to terms 
 by all means he said 
 then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected will any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers 
 surely no man he said 
 and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this 
 who indeed 
 but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous 
 yes one is enough 
 the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them 
 certainly 
 and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or impossibility 
 i think not 
 but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only possible is assuredly for the best 
 we have 
 and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not impossible 
 very good 
 and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies 
 certainly 
 i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to discuss them all the same the women and children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning we were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure like gold tried in the fire was to be made a ruler and to receive honours and rewards in life and after death this was the sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen 
 i perfectly remember he said 
 yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a philosopher 
 yes he said let that be affirmed 
 and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in shreds and patches 
 what do you mean he said 
 you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons who possess them and are at the same time and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes out of them 
 very true he said 
 on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil 
 quite true 
 and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or command 
 certainly he said 
 and will they be a class which is rarely found 
 yes indeed 
 then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises 
 yes he said you are quite right in testing him but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge 
 you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom 
 indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more 
 and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them 
 to what do you refer 
 we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it is for you to say 
 yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure of truth 
 but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further 
 not an uncommon case when people are indolent 
 yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and of the laws 
 true 
 the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling 
 what he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues 
 yes i said there is and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished picture should satisfy us when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy 
 a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge 
 nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have of been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness 
 assuredly not 
 you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge 
 yes 
 and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good 
 how ridiculous 
 yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous 
 most true he said 
 and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good 
 certainly 
 and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same 
 true 
 there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is involved 
 there can be none 
 further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one 
 very true he said 
 of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance 
 certainly not he said 
 i am sure i said that he who does not know now the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them 
 that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours 
 and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be perfectly ordered 
 of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different from either 
 aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters 
 true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others and never telling his own 
 well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know 
 not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion 
 and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of them blind you would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road 
 very true 
 and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will tell you of brightness and beauty 
 glaucon socrates 
 still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we shall be satisfied 
 yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help fearing that i shall fall and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon me no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for me but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wished to hear otherwise not 
 by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent 
 i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a false account although i have no intention of deceiving you 
 yes we will take all the care that we can proceed 
 yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other times 
 what 
 the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other things which we describe and define to all of them many is applied 
 true he said 
 and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each 
 very true 
 the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not seen 
 exactly 
 and what is the organ with which we see the visible things 
 the sight he said 
 and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense 
 true 
 but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived 
 no i never have he said 
 then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard 
 nothing of the sort 
 no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition 
 certainly not 
 but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen 
 how do you mean 
 sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible 
 of what nature are you speaking 
 of that which you term light i replied 
 true he said 
 noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing 
 nay he said the reverse of ignoble 
 and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear 
 you mean the sun as you and all mankind say 
 may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows 
 how 
 neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun 
 no 
 yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun 
 by far the most like 
 and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun 
 exactly 
 then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight 
 true he said 
 and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and the things of mind 
 will you be a little more explicit he said 
 why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision in them 
 very true 
 but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see clearly and there is sight in them 
 certainly 
 and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence 
 just so 
 now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour yet higher 
 what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good 
 god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point of view 
 in what point of view 
 you would say would you not that the sun is only the author of visibility in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he himself is not generation 
 certainly 
 in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power 
 glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how amazing 
 yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter my fancies 
 and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun 
 yes i said there is a great deal more 
 then omit nothing however slight 
 i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omitted 
 you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible i do not say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz may i suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind 
 i have 
 now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like do you understand 
 yes i understand 
 imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made 
 very good 
 would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge 
 most undoubtedly 
 next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is to be divided 
 in what manner 
 thus there are two subdivisions in the lower or which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves 
 i do not quite understand your meaning he said 
 then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminary remarks you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and everybody are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner at their conclusion 
 yes he said i know 
 and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen with the eye of the mind 
 that is true 
 and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and therefore a higher value 
 i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and the sister arts 
 and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends 
 i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason and the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason 
 you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the answering to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction to the third and perception of shadows to the let there be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth 
 i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement

 book vii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets 
 i see 
 and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent 
 you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners 
 like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave 
 true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads 
 and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows 
 yes he said 
 and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them 
 very true 
 and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow 
 no question he replied 
 to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images 
 that is certain 
 and now look again and see what will naturally follow it the prisoners are released and disabused of their error at first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him 
 far truer 
 and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him 
 true he now 
 and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent and held fast until he s forced into the presence of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities 
 not all in a moment he said 
 he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day 
 certainly 
 last of he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate him as he is 
 certainly 
 he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold 
 clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him 
 and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change and pity them 
 certainly he would 
 and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before and which followed after and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them would he not say with homer 
 better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their manner 
 yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner 
 imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness 
 to be sure he said 
 and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable would he not be ridiculous men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender and they would put him to death 
 no question he said 
 this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous argument the is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your desire i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly god knows but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed 
 i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you 
 moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted 
 yes very natural 
 and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice 
 anything but surprising he replied 
 any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den 
 that he said is a very just distinction 
 but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes 
 they undoubtedly say this he replied 
 whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being or in other words of the good 
 very true 
 and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth 
 yes he said such an art may be presumed 
 and whereas the other virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness 
 very true he said 
 but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below if i say they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now 
 very likely 
 yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest 
 very true he replied 
 then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not 
 but is not this unjust he said ought we to give them a worse life when they might have a better 
 you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state 
 true he said i had forgotten 
 observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have them being they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the double duty wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark when you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst 
 quite true he replied 
 and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light 
 impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present rulers of state 
 yes my friend i said and there lies the point you must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may have a state for only in the state which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of life whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs poor and hungering after the own private advantage thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state 
 most true he replied 
 and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy do you know of any other 
 indeed i do not he said 
 and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task for if they are there will be rival lovers and they will fight 
 no question 
 who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics 
 they are the men and i will choose them he replied 
 and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods 
 by all means he replied 
 the process i said is not the turning over of an but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophy 
 quite so 
 and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change 
 certainly 
 what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes 
 yes that was said 
 then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality 
 what quality 
 usefulness in war 
 yes if possible 
 there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not 
 just so 
 there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption 
 true 
 then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover no 
 but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme 
 music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking 
 you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly was nothing of the kind but what branch of knowledge is there my dear glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us 
 undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also excluded what remains 
 well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we shall have to take something which is not special but of universal application 
 what may that be 
 a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education 
 what is that 
 the little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them 
 yes 
 then the art of war partakes of them 
 to the sure 
 then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number and if that is true what sort of general must he have been 
 i should say a very strange one if this was as you say 
 can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic 
 certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all 
 i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this study 
 what is your notion 
 it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being 
 will you explain your meaning he said 
 i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them 
 explain he said 
 i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded 
 you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade 
 no i said that is not at all my meaning 
 then what is your meaning 
 when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite an illustration will make my meaning clearer here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a middle finger 
 very good 
 you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point 
 what is it 
 each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same in these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger 
 true 
 and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence 
 there is not he said 
 but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers can sight adequately perceive them and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness or softness or hardness and so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft 
 you are quite right he said 
 and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft what again is the meaning of light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light 
 yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained 
 yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two 
 true 
 and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different 
 certainly 
 and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one 
 true 
 the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner they were not distinguished 
 yes 
 whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused 
 very true 
 was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great and what is small 
 exactly so 
 and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible 
 most true 
 this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not 
 i understand he said and agree with you 
 and to which class do unity and number belong 
 i do not know he replied 
 think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being 
 and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude 
 yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number 
 certainly 
 and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number 
 yes 
 and they appear to lead the mind towards truth 
 yes in a very remarkable manner 
 then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician 
 that is true 
 and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher 
 certainly 
 then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal men of our state to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like merchants or with a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being 
 that is excellent he said 
 yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper 
 how do you mean 
 i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions 
 that is very true 
 now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable indivisible what would they answer 
 they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realised in thought 
 then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth 
 yes that is a marked characteristic of it 
 and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been 
 very true he said 
 and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as difficult 
 you will not 
 and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up 
 i agree 
 let this then be made one of our subjects of education and next shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us 
 you mean geometry 
 exactly so 
 clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician 
 yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold 
 true he said 
 then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it does not concern us 
 yes that is what we assert 
 yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians 
 how so 
 they have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science 
 certainly he said 
 then must not a further admission be made 
 what admission 
 that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient 
 that he replied may be readily allowed and is true 
 then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down 
 nothing will be more likely to have such an effect 
 then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry moreover the science has indirect effects which are not small 
 of what kind he said 
 there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not 
 yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them 
 then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study 
 let us do so he replied 
 and suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say 
 i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor 
 i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them and therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive 
 i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf 
 then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences 
 what was the mistake he said 
 after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have followed 
 that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects 
 why yes i said and for two reasons in the first place no government patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they have a director but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to him that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light 
 yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them but i do not clearly understand the change in the order first you began with a geometry of plane surfaces 
 yes i said 
 and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward 
 yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids 
 true he said 
 then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth 
 the right order he replied and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your own spirit for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another 
 every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to me 
 and what then would you say 
 i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards 
 what do you mean he asked 
 you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes and you are very likely right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back 
 i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke still i should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking 
 i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true figure now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight 
 true he replied 
 the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion 
 no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous 
 and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth 
 i quite agree though i never thought of this before 
 then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use 
 that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers 
 yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value but can you tell me of any other suitable study 
 no he said not without thinking 
 motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine which may be left to wiser persons 
 but where are the two 
 there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named 
 and what may that be 
 the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister sciences as the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them 
 yes he replied 
 but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object 
 what is that 
 there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did in astronomy for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same thing happens the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain 
 yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same either party setting their ears before their understanding 
 you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony for they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain to is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not 
 that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge 
 a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit useless very true he said 
 now when all these studies reach the point of and connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in them 
 i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work 
 what do you mean i said the prelude or what do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician 
 assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning 
 but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them 
 neither can this be supposed 
 and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic this is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself and so with dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible 
 exactly he said 
 then this is the progress which you call dialectic 
 true 
 but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water which are divine and are the shadows of true existence not shadows of images cast by a light of fire which compared with the sun is only an image this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described 
 i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet from another point of view is harder still to deny this however is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and again and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest 
 dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth according to my notion whether what i told you would or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like reality of that i am confident 
 doubtless he replied 
 but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences 
 of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last 
 and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them for when a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science 
 impossible he said 
 then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing custom terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was called understanding but why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider 
 why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness 
 at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make a proportion 
 as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion 
 and as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of shadows but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been 
 as far as i understand he said i agree 
 and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing and he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence will you admit so much 
 yes he said how can i deny it 
 and you would say the same of the conception of the good 
 until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world below and has his final quietus 
 in all that i should most certainly agree with you 
 and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters 
 certainly not 
 then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions 
 yes he said you and i together will make it 
 dialectic then as you will agree is the of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go 
 i agree he said 
 but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered 
 yes clearly 
 you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before 
 certainly he said 
 the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education 
 and what are these 
 such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the own and is not shared with the body 
 very true he replied 
 further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him 
 certainly he said he must have natural gifts 
 the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards 
 what do you mean 
 in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry i mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness 
 certainly he said 
 and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected 
 to be sure 
 and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard 
 that is very true he said 
 all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present 
 that would not be creditable 
 certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am equally ridiculous 
 in what respect 
 i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much excitement for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement 
 indeed i was listening and did not think so 
 but i who am the speaker felt that i was and now let me remind you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary toil 
 of course 
 and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of education 
 why not 
 because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind 
 very true 
 then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent 
 that is a very rational notion he said 
 do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them 
 yes i remember 
 the same practice may be followed i said in all these things labours lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number 
 at what age 
 at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected 
 certainly he replied 
 after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being 
 yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root 
 yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical 
 i agree with you he said 
 these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most of this comprehension and who are more steadfast in their learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great caution is required 
 why great caution 
 do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced 
 what evil he said 
 the students of the art are filled with lawlessness 
 quite true he said 
 do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case or will you make allowance for them 
 in what way make allowance 
 i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has many flatterers when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again when he knows or shall i guess for you 
 if you please 
 then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter 
 he will 
 but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations 
 well all that is very probable but how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy 
 in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them 
 that is true 
 there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers 
 true 
 now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before 
 impossible 
 and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires 
 he cannot 
 and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it 
 unquestionably 
 now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have described and also as i was just now saying most excusable 
 yes he said and i may add pitiable 
 therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic 
 certainly 
 there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them 
 yes he said there is nothing which they like better 
 and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world 
 too true he said 
 but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit 
 very true he said 
 and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance aspirant or intruder 
 very true 
 suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough 
 would you say six or four years he asked 
 say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch 
 and how long is this stage of their lives to last 
 fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the pythian oracle consent as but if not as in any case blessed and divine 
 you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty 
 yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go 
 there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things like the men 
 well i said and you would agree would you not that what has been said about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city 
 how will they proceed 
 they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most 
 yes that will be the best way and i think socrates that you have very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into being 
 enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its image there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him 
 there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said

 book viii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings 
 that replied glaucon has been acknowledged 
 yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed 
 yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state 
 true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path 
 there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived 
 your recollection i said is most exact 
 then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then 
 yes if i can i will i said 
 i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking 
 that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state i do not know do you of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians 
 yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them 
 do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them 
 yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters 
 then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five 
 certainly 
 him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described 
 we have 
 then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice the enquiry will then be completed and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice 
 certainly he replied we must do as you say 
 shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision 
 that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable 
 first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved 
 very true he said 
 in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest 
 how would they address us 
 after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in existences pass over a short space and in ones over a long space but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great x and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i e omitting fractions the side of which is five x x each of them being less by one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five and a hundred cubes of three x now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us the muses first by music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like are of gold and silver and brass and iron and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us 
 yes and we may assume that they answer truly 
 why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely 
 and what do the muses say next 
 when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them 
 i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change 
 and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy 
 very true 
 such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities 
 true he said 
 in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former 
 true 
 but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar 
 yes 
 yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please 
 that is most true he said 
 and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music 
 undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil 
 why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element 
 assuredly he said 
 such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour 
 very true he replied 
 now what man answers to this form of did he come into being and what is he like 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon 
 perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different 
 in what respects 
 he should have more of and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase 
 yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy 
 such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost his best guardian 
 who was that said adeimantus 
 philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life 
 good he said 
 such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state 
 exactly 
 his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a grave father who dwells in an city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble 
 and how does the son come into being 
 the character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too adding all the other complaints about her own which women are so fond of rehearsing 
 yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves 
 and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the are honoured and applauded the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious 
 you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly 
 then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character 
 we have 
 next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says 
 is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state 
 by all means 
 i believe that oligarchy follows next in order 
 and what manner of government do you term oligarchy 
 a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it 
 i understand he replied 
 ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises 
 yes 
 well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other 
 how 
 the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law 
 yes indeed 
 and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money 
 likely enough 
 and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls 
 true 
 and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured 
 clearly 
 and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected 
 that is obvious 
 and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 
 they do so 
 they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work 
 very true 
 and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established 
 yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking 
 first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot 
 you mean that they would shipwreck 
 yes and is not this true of the government of anything 
 i should imagine so 
 except a city or would you include a city 
 nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all 
 this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy 
 clearly 
 and here is another defect which is quite as bad 
 what defect 
 the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another 
 that surely is at least as bad 
 another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes 
 how discreditable 
 and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one does that look well 
 anything but well 
 there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable 
 what evil 
 a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature 
 yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state 
 the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty 
 true 
 but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift 
 as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift 
 may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive 
 just so socrates 
 and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed 
 most true he said 
 clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors 
 clearly 
 well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers 
 yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler 
 and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force 
 certainly we may be so bold 
 the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education and an evil constitution of the state 
 true 
 such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils 
 very likely 
 then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state 
 by all means 
 does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise 
 how 
 a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him 
 nothing more likely 
 and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion from his throne humbled by poverty he takes to and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar 
 most true he replied 
 and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it 
 of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one 
 and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth 
 yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came 
 let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them 
 very good 
 first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth 
 certainly 
 also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable 
 true 
 he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a true image of the state which he represents 
 he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state 
 you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said 
 i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 
 excellent i said yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life 
 true 
 do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries 
 where must i look 
 you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan 
 aye 
 it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions 
 to be sure 
 yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own 
 yes and they will be strong in him too 
 the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones 
 true 
 for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him 
 i should expect so 
 and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money 
 very true 
 can we any longer doubt then that the miser and answers to the oligarchical state 
 there can be no doubt 
 next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgement 
 that he said is our method 
 well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise is it not on this wise the good at which such a state alms is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable 
 what then 
 the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance 
 to be sure 
 there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded 
 that is tolerably clear 
 and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary 
 yes often 
 and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution 
 that is true 
 on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state 
 yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain 
 the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a use of his own property or by another remedy 
 what other 
 one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state 
 yes they will be greatly lessened 
 at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain 
 very true 
 they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue 
 yes quite as indifferent 
 such is the state of affairs which prevails among them and often rulers and their subjects may come in one way whether on a pilgrimage or a march as or aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much 
 yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking 
 and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause 
 yes surely 
 and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot 
 yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw 
 and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they for as the government is such will be the man 
 clearly he said 
 in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes 
 tis said so he replied 
 and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases 
 clearly 
 then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures 
 there will 
 this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states 
 yes 
 yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government 
 why 
 because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state 
 he will be sure to have patterns enough 
 and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful 
 for the moment yes 
 and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares 
 yes he replied many and many a one 
 see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the friend 
 yes she is of a noble spirit 
 these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike 
 we know her well 
 consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being 
 very good he said 
 is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits 
 exactly 
 and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary 
 obviously 
 would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures 
 i should 
 are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us and they are rightly so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it 
 true 
 we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary 
 we are not 
 and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary 
 yes certainly 
 suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them 
 very good 
 will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class 
 that is what i should suppose 
 the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life 
 yes 
 but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health 
 certainly 
 and the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary 
 very true 
 may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production 
 certainly 
 and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good 
 true 
 and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical 
 very true 
 again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process 
 what is the process 
 when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical 
 inevitably 
 and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike 
 certainly 
 and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself 
 it must be so 
 and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young soul and order is restored 
 yes he said that sometimes happens 
 and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous 
 yes he said that is apt to be the way 
 they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him 
 very true 
 at length they seize upon the citadel of the young soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels 
 none better 
 false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place 
 they are certain to do so 
 and so the young man returns into the country of the and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border 
 yes with a will 
 and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures 
 yes he said the change in him is visible enough 
 after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally 
 very true he said 
 neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another 
 yes he said that is the way with him 
 yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on 
 yes he replied he is all liberty and equality 
 yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him 
 just so 
 let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man 
 let that be his place he said 
 last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider 
 quite true he said 
 say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident 
 clearly 
 and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort 
 how 
 the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right 
 yes 
 and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of was also the ruin of oligarchy 
 true 
 and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution 
 what good 
 freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell 
 yes the saying is in mouth 
 i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny 
 how so 
 when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs 
 yes he replied a very common occurrence 
 yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public now in such a state can liberty have any limit 
 certainly not 
 by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them 
 how do you mean 
 i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either 
 yes he said that is the way 
 and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young 
 quite true he said 
 the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other 
 why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips 
 that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the as the proverb says are as good as their and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty 
 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe you and i have dreamed the same thing 
 and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them 
 yes he said i know it too well 
 such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny 
 glorious indeed he said but what is the next step 
 the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government 
 true 
 the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery 
 yes the natural order 
 and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty 
 as we might expect 
 that however was not as i believe your rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both 
 just so he replied 
 well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings 
 a very just comparison 
 these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible 
 yes by all means he said 
 then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state 
 that is true 
 and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified 
 how so 
 because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones 
 very true he said 
 then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass 
 what is that 
 they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be the richest 
 naturally so 
 they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones 
 why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little 
 and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them 
 that is pretty much the case he said 
 the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy 
 true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey 
 and do they not share i said do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves 
 why yes he said to that extent the people do share 
 and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can 
 what else can they do 
 and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy true 
 and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them 
 that is exactly the truth 
 then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another 
 true 
 the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness 
 yes that is their way 
 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector 
 yes that is quite clear 
 how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus 
 what tale 
 the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf did you never hear it 
 oh yes 
 and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant 
 inevitably 
 this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich 
 the same 
 after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown 
 that is clear 
 and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him 
 yes he said that is their usual way 
 then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the friend as they say be lost to them 
 exactly 
 the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves 
 very true 
 and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus 
 by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 
 and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again 
 but if he is caught he dies 
 of course 
 and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute 
 no doubt he said 
 and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated 
 yes he said let us consider that 
 at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one 
 of course he said 
 but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader 
 to be sure 
 has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him clearly 
 and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war 
 he must 
 now he begins to grow unpopular 
 a necessary result 
 then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done 
 yes that may be expected 
 and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything 
 he cannot 
 and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state 
 yes he said and a rare purgation 
 yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse 
 if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself 
 what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all 
 yes that is the alternative 
 and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require 
 certainly 
 and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them 
 they will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays them 
 by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land 
 yes he said there are 
 but will he not desire to get them on the spot 
 how do you mean 
 he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his bodyguard 
 to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all 
 what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends 
 yes he said they are quite of his sort 
 yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him 
 of course 
 verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian 
 why so 
 why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 
 tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions 
 yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets 
 and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny 
 yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us 
 but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies 
 very true 
 moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further 
 true 
 but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and army of his 
 if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people 
 and when these fail 
 why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his estate 
 you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions 
 yes he said they cannot help themselves 
 but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates 
 by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong 
 why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence what beat his father if he opposes him 
 yes he will having first disarmed him 
 then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery 
 true he said 
 very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny 
 yes quite enough he said

 book ix 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in misery 
 yes he said he is the only one remaining 
 there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered 
 what question 
 i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused 
 well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
 very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them 
 which appetites do you mean 
 i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
 most true he said 
 but when a pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
 i quite agree 
 in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me 
 yes i agree 
 and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
 true 
 and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his meanness at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
 yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
 and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his principles 
 i can imagine him 
 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him 
 yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
 and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full 
 yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
 and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
 i should not wonder 
 further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
 he has 
 and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods 
 that he will 
 and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate o my friend is not that so 
 assuredly 
 such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live 
 suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
 i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul 
 that is certain 
 yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many 
 they are indeed he said 
 his revenues if he has any are soon spent 
 true 
 then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
 of course 
 when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
 yes that is sure to be the case 
 he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs 
 he must 
 and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs 
 no doubt he will 
 and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them 
 very true 
 and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
 yes probably 
 and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
 but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
 yes indeed he said i believe that he would 
 truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother 
 he is indeed he replied 
 he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself have we not here a picture of his way of life 
 yes indeed he said 
 and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city 
 what sort of mischief 
 for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes 
 a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number 
 yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant 
 yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
 if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters this is the end of his passions and desires 
 exactly 
 when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more 
 yes truly 
 they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
 certainly not 
 and may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
 no question 
 also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
 yes he said and we were perfectly right 
 let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
 most true 
 and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
 socrates glaucon 
 that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer 
 and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general 
 yes he said inevitably 
 and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others 
 certainly 
 and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man 
 to be sure 
 then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
 they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst 
 there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion 
 a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest 
 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
 that again he said is a very fair proposal 
 shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries 
 by all means 
 let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
 what do you mean he asked 
 beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
 no city he said can be more completely enslaved 
 and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state 
 yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
 then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest 
 inevitably 
 and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave 
 he has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily 
 utterly incapable 
 and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
 certainly 
 and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
 poor 
 and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
 true 
 and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear 
 yes indeed 
 is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain 
 certainly not 
 and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
 impossible 
 reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states 
 and i was right he said 
 certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him 
 i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
 there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong 
 what do you mean 
 i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
 then who is more miserable 
 one of whom i am about to speak 
 who is that 
 he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant 
 from what has been said i gather that you are right 
 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest 
 very true he said 
 let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject 
 what is your illustration 
 the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
 yes that is the difference 
 you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants 
 what should they fear 
 nothing but do you observe the reason of this 
 yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual 
 very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves 
 yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
 the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
 yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
 and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
 his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies 
 and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
 very true he said 
 and amid evils such as these will not he who is in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men 
 yes he said the similitude is most exact 
 is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
 certainly 
 he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds 
 very true he said 
 moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself 
 no man of any sense will dispute your words 
 come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
 the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
 need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state 
 make the proclamation yourself he said 
 and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 let the words be added 
 then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight 
 what is that 
 the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration 
 of what nature 
 it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers 
 how do you mean he said 
 there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money 
 that is true he said 
 if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money 
 i agree with you 
 again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame 
 true 
 suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable 
 extremely suitable 
 on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame 
 far less 
 lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul 
 certainly 
 one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen 
 yes 
 then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
 exactly 
 and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
 very true 
 now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver 
 true he said 
 and the lover of honour what will be his opinion will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
 very true 
 and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them 
 there can be no doubt of that he replied 
 since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly 
 i cannot myself tell he said 
 well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and wisdom and reason 
 there cannot be a better he said 
 then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain 
 the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
 then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience 
 yes very great 
 again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
 nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only 
 his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
 far better 
 and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
 certainly 
 further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
 what faculty 
 reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
 yes 
 and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
 certainly 
 if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
 assuredly 
 or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
 clearly 
 but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
 the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
 and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
 unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life 
 and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next 
 clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the 
 last comes the lover of gain 
 very true he said 
 twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls 
 yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
 i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
 proceed 
 say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
 true 
 and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
 there is 
 a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean 
 yes 
 you remember what people say when they are sick 
 what do they say 
 that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
 yes i know he said 
 and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain 
 i have 
 and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure 
 yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest 
 again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful 
 doubtless he said 
 then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain 
 so it would seem 
 but can that which is neither become both 
 i should say not 
 and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
 yes 
 but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them 
 yes 
 how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
 impossible 
 this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition 
 that is the inference 
 look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 what are they he said and where shall i find them 
 there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
 most true he said 
 let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 no 
 still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain 
 that is true 
 and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature 
 yes 
 shall i give you an illustration of them 
 let me hear 
 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region 
 i should 
 and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
 to be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
 but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending 
 no doubt 
 all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions 
 yes 
 then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this 
 no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
 look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state 
 yes 
 and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
 true 
 and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
 certainly 
 and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer 
 clearly from that which has more 
 what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal 
 far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable 
 and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence 
 yes of knowledge in the same degree 
 and of truth in the same degree 
 yes 
 and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence 
 necessarily 
 then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul 
 far less 
 and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
 yes 
 what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real 
 of course 
 and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
 unquestionably 
 those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
 verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle 
 their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth 
 something of that sort must inevitably happen 
 and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense 
 yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
 then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
 yes certainly the best is the most natural 
 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable 
 exactly 
 but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
 true 
 and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
 yes 
 and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order 
 clearly 
 and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance yes 
 and the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
 yes 
 then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least 
 certainly 
 but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly 
 inevitably 
 would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
 will you tell me 
 there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
 how do you mean 
 i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle 
 yes 
 and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch 
 he will 
 and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical 
 yes he is third 
 then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three 
 manifestly 
 the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure 
 certainly 
 and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king 
 yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
 or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval 
 what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
 yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 
 yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
 then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue 
 immeasurably greater 
 well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just 
 yes that was said 
 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him 
 what shall we say to him 
 let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes 
 of what sort 
 an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one 
 there are said of have been such unions 
 then do you now model the form of a multitudinous monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
 you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose 
 suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second 
 that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say 
 and now join them and let the three grow into one 
 that has been accomplished 
 next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature i have done so he said 
 and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
 to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
 he should watch over the monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself 
 yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
 and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant 
 yes from every point of view 
 come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now 
 not if he has any regard for my opinion 
 but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin 
 yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him 
 has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
 clearly 
 and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
 yes 
 and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him 
 very true 
 and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey 
 true he said 
 and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them 
 such appears to be the reason 
 and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals 
 true he said 
 and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways 
 yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness 
 from no point of view at all 
 what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body 
 certainly he said 
 to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
 clearly he said 
 in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
 certainly he will if he has true music in him 
 and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm 
 certainly not he said 
 he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means 
 very true 
 and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
 then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
 by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call 
 i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
 in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other 
 i think so he said

 book x 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry 
 to what do you refer 
 to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished 
 what do you mean 
 speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them 
 explain the purport of your remark 
 well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out 
 very good he said 
 listen to me then or rather answer me 
 put your question 
 can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know 
 a likely thing then that i should know 
 why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener 
 very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself 
 well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me 
 i do 
 let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not 
 yes 
 but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table 
 true 
 and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he 
 impossible 
 and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him 
 who is he 
 one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
 what an extraordinary man 
 wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also 
 he must be a wizard and no mistake 
 oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself 
 what way 
 an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror 
 yes he said but they would be appearances only 
 very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not 
 of course 
 but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
 yes he said but not a real bed 
 and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed 
 yes i did 
 then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
 at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth 
 no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth 
 no wonder 
 suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is 
 if you please 
 well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
 no 
 there is another which is the work of the carpenter 
 yes 
 and the work of the painter is a third 
 yes 
 beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 
 yes there are three of them 
 god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god 
 why is that 
 because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others 
 very true he said 
 god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
 so we believe 
 shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed 
 yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things 
 and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed 
 yes 
 but would you call the painter a creator and maker 
 certainly not 
 yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
 i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make 
 good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator 
 certainly he said 
 and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
 that appears to be so 
 then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painter i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
 the latter 
 as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things 
 yes he said the difference is only apparent 
 now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality 
 of appearance 
 then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
 certainly 
 and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
 most true 
 and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
 the question he said should by all means be considered 
 now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the branch would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him 
 i should say not 
 the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
 yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit 
 then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you is there any city which he might name 
 i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator 
 well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
 there is not 
 or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
 there is absolutely nothing of the kind 
 but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him 
 nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive 
 yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough 
 yes socrates that i think is quite true 
 then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures 
 quite so 
 in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose 
 yes he said 
 they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
 exactly 
 here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only am i not right 
 yes 
 then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation 
 proceed 
 of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit 
 yes 
 and the worker in leather and brass will make them 
 certainly 
 but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
 most true 
 and may we not say the same of all things 
 what 
 that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
 yes 
 and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them 
 true 
 then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the will tell the which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
 of course 
 the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him 
 true 
 the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
 true 
 but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw 
 neither 
 then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
 i suppose not 
 the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations 
 nay very much the reverse 
 and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
 just so 
 thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
 very true 
 and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
 certainly 
 and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
 what do you mean 
 i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance 
 true 
 and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic 
 true 
 and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
 most true 
 and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul 
 to be sure 
 and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction 
 true 
 but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
 very true 
 then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure 
 true 
 and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation 
 certainly 
 and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul 
 no doubt 
 this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
 exactly 
 the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring 
 very true 
 and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
 probably the same would be true of poetry 
 do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
 by all means 
 we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything more 
 no there is nothing else 
 but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
 and we were right he said 
 yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied 
 what was the omission 
 were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another 
 yes 
 but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
 the latter he said is the truer statement 
 tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
 it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
 when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
 true 
 there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow 
 true 
 but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him 
 certainly 
 one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
 how do you mean 
 the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
 what is most required he asked 
 that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
 yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
 yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason 
 clearly 
 and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly 
 indeed we may 
 and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers 
 certainly 
 then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated 
 clearly 
 and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 
 exactly 
 but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
 yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
 hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most 
 yes of course i know 
 but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
 very true he said 
 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person 
 no he said that is certainly not reasonable 
 nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view 
 what point of view 
 if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
 how very true 
 and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home 
 quite true he said 
 and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue 
 i cannot deny it 
 therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state 
 that is most true he said 
 and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer 
 yes indeed i am greatly charmed 
 shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre 
 certainly 
 and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
 certainly he said we shall the gainers 
 if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law 
 yes he said i quite agree with you 
 yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been 
 and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue 
 what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness 
 why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity 
 say rather nothing he replied 
 and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole 
 of the whole certainly but why do you ask 
 are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
 he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this 
 yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it 
 i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light 
 listen then 
 i am attending 
 there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
 yes he replied 
 would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
 yes 
 and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
 yes he said 
 and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
 true 
 the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil 
 certainly not 
 if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction 
 that may be assumed 
 well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
 yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
 but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true 
 yes 
 consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body 
 certainly not 
 and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
 it is he replied 
 consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny 
 very true 
 and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another 
 yes he said there is reason in that 
 either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man 
 and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death 
 but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds 
 nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her from being a house of death 
 true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
 yes that can hardly be 
 but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal 
 certainly 
 that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality 
 very true 
 but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity 
 what do you mean he said 
 the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
 certainly not 
 her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but not there glaucon not there must we look 
 where then 
 at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough 
 true he replied 
 and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades 
 very true 
 and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
 certainly not he said 
 will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
 what did i borrow 
 the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice do you remember 
 i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 
 then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own 
 the demand he said is just 
 in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods 
 granted 
 and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
 true 
 and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins 
 certainly 
 then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue 
 yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him 
 and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
 certainly 
 such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
 that is my conviction 
 and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
 true 
 and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
 certainly he said what you say is true 
 these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides 
 yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
 and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them 
 speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear 
 socrates 
 well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great 
 now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the of a trireme from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other 
 when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness 
 and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations 
 all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
 and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

 of death 
 men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other certainly the contemplation of death as the wages of sin and passage to another world is holy and religious but the fear of it as a tribute due unto nature is weak yet in religious meditations there is sometimes mixture of vanity and of superstition 
 you shall read in some of the friars books of mortifications that a man should think with himself what the pain is if he have but his end pressed or tortured and thereby imagine what the pains of death are when the whole body is corrupted and dissolved when many times death passeth with less pain then the torture of a limb for the most vital parts are not the quickest of sense and by him that spoke only as a philosopher and natural man it was well said pompa mortis magis terret quam mars ipsa groans and convulsions and a discoloured face and friends weeping and blacks and obsequies and the like show death terrible it is worthy the observing that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak but it mates and masters the fear of death and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man hath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him revenge triumphs over death love slights it honour aspireth to it grief flieth to it fear preoccupieth it nay we read after otho the emperor had slain himself pity which is the tenderest of affections provoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign and as the truest sort of followers nay seneca adds niceness and satiety cogita quarn diu eadem feceris mori velle non tantun fortis out miser sed etiam fastidiosus potest 
 a man would die though he were neither valiant nor miserable only upon a weariness to do the same thing so oft over and over it is no less worthy to observe how little alteration in good spirits die approaches of death make for they appear to be the same men till the last instant augustus caesar died in a compliment livia coniugii nostri memor vive et vale tiberius in dissimulation as tacitus saith of him mm tiberium vires et corpus non dissimulatio deserebant vespasian in a jest sitting upon the stool ut puto deus fio galba with a si ex re sit populi romani holding forth his neck septimius severus in dispatch quid mihi restat agendum and the like certainly the stoics bestowed too much cost upon death and by their great preparations made it appear more fearful better saith he qui finem vitae extremism inter munera ponat naturae it is as natural to die as to be born and to a little infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other he that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one that is wounded in hot blood who for the time scarce feels the therefore a mind fixed and bent upon somewhat that 
 is good doth avert me dolours of death but above all believe it the sweetest 
 canticle is minc difmittis when a man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations 
 
 death hath this also that it openeth the gate to good fame and extinguisheth envy exstinctus amabitur idem

 book just man 
 chapter i 
 
 m myriel 
 in m myriel was bishop of d he was an old man of about years of age he had occupied the see of d since 
 although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous if merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese 
 true or false that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do m myriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of aix hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar 
 it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk 
 he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry 
 the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed 
 m charles myriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution 
 there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered 
 he had no children what took place next in the fate of m myriel 
 the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powers of these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him 
 was he in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune 
 no one could have told 
 all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest 
 in m myriel was the cure of b brignolles he was already advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner 
 about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his what is not precisely him to paris 
 among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was m le cardinal fesch 
 one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy cure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed 
 napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man turned round and said abruptly 
 who is this good man who is staring at me 
 sire said m myriel you are looking at a good man and i at a great man 
 each of us can profit by it 
 that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d 
 what truth was there after all in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m life 
 no one knew very few families had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution 
 m myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop 
 but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors sayings words less than words palabres as the energetic language of the south expresses it 
 however that may be after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in d all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion 
 no one would have dared to mention them no one would have dared to recall them 
 m myriel had arrived at d accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptistine who was his sister and ten years his junior 
 their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptistine and named madame magloire who after having been the servant of m le cure now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur 
 mademoiselle baptistine was a long pale thin gentle creature she realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen she was a soul rather than a virgin 
 her person seemed made of a shadow there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex a little matter enclosing a light large eyes forever drooping a mere pretext for a remaining on the earth 
 madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma 
 on his arrival m myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediately after a the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general and the prefect 
 the installation over the town waited to see its bishop at work

 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes 
 the truck continues through the city but ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front as it is stopped she hops out running to the footpath as the truck screeches away she leans against a tree yawning then continues on 
 crossing a street she walks straight across the passenger cabin of a carriage parked alongside the pavement to the bewilderment of the passengers and driver the cab drives away as ann continues on 
 a light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of the building the carriage was parked in front of

 it was a vast shining globe and it cast a light of lambent topaz into it wasnot a sun thus the planet had fooled men for a long time not until entering closeorbit around it did its discoverers realize that this was a world in a binary system andnot a third sun itself 
 at first it seemed certain nothing could exist on such a planet least of all both massive g and g stars orbited a common center with peculiar to permitthe development of a rather stable if exquisitely hot climate mostly this was a drydesert of a world whose unusual yellow glow was the result of doublesunlight striking sands and flats that same sunlight suddenly shone onthe thin skin of a metallic shape falling crazily toward the atmosphere 
 the erratic course the galactic cruiser was traveling was intentional not theproduct of injury but of a desperate desire to avoid it long streaks of intense energyslid close past its hull a multihued storm of destruction like a school of rainbowremoras fighting to attach themselves to a larger unwilling host 
 one of those probing questing beams succeeded in touching the fleeing its principal solar fin gemlike fragments of mental and plastic erupted intospace as the end of the fin disintegrated the vessel seemed to shudder 
 the source of those multiple energy beams suddenly hove into imperial cruise its massive outline bristling cactuslike with dozens ofheavy weapons emplacements light ceased arching from those spines now as thecruiser moved in close intermittent explosions and flashes of light could be seen inthose portion of the smaller ship which had taken hits in the absolute cold of spacethe cruiser snuggled up alongside its wounded prey 
 another distant explosions shook the it certainly feel distant toartoo detoo or see threepio the concussion bounced them around the narrowcorridor like bearings in an old motor 
 to look at these two one would have supposed that the tall was the master and the stubby tripodal robot artoo detoo an while threepio might have sniffed disdainfully at the suggestion they were infact equal in everything save loquacity here threepio was clearly andnecessarily the superior 
 still another explosion rattled the corridor throwing threepio off balance hisshorter companion had the better of it during such moments with his squat low center of gravity well balanced on thick clawed glanced up at threepio who was steadying himself against a corridor blinked enigmatically around a single mechanical eye as the smaller robotstudied the battered casing of his friend a patina of metal and fibrous dust coatedthe usually gleaming bronze finish and there were some visible dents all the resultof the pounding the rebel ship they were on had been taking 
 accompanying the last attack was a persistent deep hum which even the loudestexplosion had not been able to drown out then for no apparent reason the bassothrumming abruptly ceased and the only sounds in the otherwise deserted corridorcame from the eerie crackle of shorting relays or the pops of dying began to echo through the ship once more but they were far away fromthe corridor 
 threepio turned his smooth humanlike head to one side metallic ears listenedintently the imitation of a human pose was hardly auditorysensors were fully the slim robot had been programmed toblend perfectly among human company this programming extended even tomimicry of human gestures 
 did you hear that he inquired rhetorically of his patient companion referringto the throbbing sound shut down the main reactor and the drive hisvoice was as full of disbelief and concern as that of any human one metallic palmrubbed dolefully at a patch of dull gray on his side where a broken hull brace hadfallen and scored the bronze finish threepio was a fastidious machine and suchthings troubled him 
 madness this is madness he shook his head slowly this time bedestroyed for sure 
 artoo did not comment immediately barrel torso tilted backward powerfullegs gripping the deck the robot was engrossed in studying the roofoverhead though he did not have a head to cock in a listening posture like hisfriend artoo still somehow managed to convey that impression a series of shortbeeps and chirps issued from his speaker to even a sensitive human ear they wouldhave been just so much static but to threepio they formed words as clear and pure asdirect current 
 yes i suppose they did have to shut the drive down threepio admitted butwhat are we going to do now we enter atmosphere with our main stablizer findestroyed i believe simply going to surrender 
 a small band of armed humans suddenly appeared rifles held at the expressions were as as their uniforms and they carried aboutthem the aura of men prepared to die 
 threepio watched silently until they had vanished around a far bend in thepassageway then looked back at artoo the smaller robot shifted from hisposition of listening gaze turned upward also though he knew were slightly sharper than his own 
 what is it artoo a short burst of beeping came in response anothermoment and there was no need for highly attuned sensors for a minute or twomore the corridor remained deathly silent then a faint scrape scrape could beheard like a cat at a door from somewhere on the hull 
 when several muffled explosions sounded threepio murmured in somewhere above us no escape for the captain this he peered down at artoo i think better 
 the shriek of overstressed metal filled the air before he could finish and the farend of the passageway was lit by a blinding actinic flash somewhere down therethe little cluster of armed crew who had passed by minutes before had encountered attackers 
 threepio turned his face and delicate photoreceptors away just in time to avoidthe fragments of metal that flew down the corridor at the far end a gaping holeappeared in the roof and reflective forms like big metal beads began dropping to thecorridor floor both robots knew that no machine could match the fluidity withwhich those shapes moved and instantly assumed fighting postures the newarrivals were humans in armor not mechanicals 
 one of them looked straight at not at him the panicked robotthrough frantically but past him the figure shifted its big rifle around in armoredhands too late a beam of intense light struck the head sending pieces of and flesh flying in all directions 
 half the invading imperial troops turned and began returning fire up past the two robots 
 way threepio ordered intending to retreat from the turned with him they had taken only a couple of steps when they saw therebel crewmen in position ahead firing down the corridor in seconds thepassageway was filled with smoke and crisscrossing beams of energy 
 red green and blue bolts ricocheted off polished sections of wall and floor orripped long gashes in metal surfaces screams of injured and dying humans apeculiarly unrobotic sound threepio piercingly above the inorganicdestruction 
 one beam struck near the feet at the same time as a second one burst thewall directly behind him exposing sparking circuitry and rows of conduits theforce of the twin blast tumbled threepio into the shredded cables where a dozendifferent currents turned him into a jerking twisting display 
 strange sensations coursed through his metal they caused no confusion every time he moved and tried to free himself there was anotherviolent crackling as a fresh cluster of componentry broke the noise and remained constant around him as the battle continued to rage 
 smoke began to fill the corridor artoo detoo bustled about trying to help freehis friend the little robot evidenced a phlegmatic indifference to the raveningenergies filling the passageway he was built so low that most of the beams passedover him anyhow 
 help threepio yelled suddenly frightened at a new message from aninternal sensor i think something is melting free my left nearthe pelvic servomotor typically his tone turned abruptly from pleading to berating 
 this is all your fault he shouted angrily i should have known better than totrust the logic of a thermocapsulary dehousing assister i know whyyou insisted we leave our assigned stations to come down this stupid access that it matters now the whole ship must be artoo detoo cut him off inmidspeech with some angry beepings and hoots of his own though he continued tocut and pull with precision at the tangled cables 
 is that so threepio sneered in reply the same to you you little 
 and exceptionally violent explosion shook the passage drowning him out miasma of carbonized component filled the air obscuring everything 
 two meters tall bipedal flowing black robes trailing from the figure and aface forever masked by a functional if bizarre black metal breath screen a dark lordof the sith was an awesome threatening shape as it strode through the corridors of therebel ship 
 fear followed the footsteps of all the dark lords the cloud of evil whichclung tight about this particular one was intense enough to cause hardened imperialtroops to back away menacing enough to set them muttering nervously amongthemselves rebel crewmembers ceased resisting broke and ran inpanic at the sight of the black armor armor which though black as it was was notnearly as dark as the thoughts drifting through the mind within 
 one purpose one thought one obsession dominated that mind now it burnedin the brain of darth vader as he turned down another passageway in the brokenfighter there smoke was beginning to clear though the sound of faraway fightingstill resounded through the hull the battle here had ended and moved on 
 only a robot was left to stir freely in the wake of the dark passing seethreepio finally stepped clear of the last restraining cable somewhere behind himhuman screams could be heard from where relentless imperial troops were moppingup the last remnants of rebel resistance 
 threepio glanced down and saw only scarred deck as he looked around hisvoice was full of concern artoo are you the smoke seemed topart just a bit more threepio found himself staring up the passageway 
 artoo detoo it seemed was there but he looking in instead the little robot appeared frozen in an attitude of over him was difficult for even electronic photoreceptorsto penetrate the clinging acidic human figure it was young slim and byabstruse human standards of aesthetics threepio mused of a calm beauty onesmall hand seemed to be moving over the front of torso 
 threepio started toward them as the haze thickened once more but when hereached the end of the corridor only artoo stood there waiting threepio peeredpast him uncertain robots were occasionally subject to electronic why should he hallucinate a human 
 he shruggedthen again why not especially when one considered theconfusing circumstances of the past hour and the dose of raw current he had recentlyabsorbed he be surprised at anything his concatenated internal circuitconjured up 
 where have you been threepio finally asked hiding i suppose hedecided not to mention the if it had been a hallucination he to give artoo the satisfaction of knowing how badly recent events had unsettledhis logic circuits 
 be coming back this way he went on nodding down the corridor andnot giving the small automation a chance to reply looking for human are we going to do now they trust the word of machinesthat we know anything of value be sent to the spice mines of kessel ortaken apart for spare components for other less deserving robots if consider us potential program traps and blow us apart on sight if we artoo had already turned and was ambling quickly back down the passageway 
 wait where are you going you been listening to me utteringcurses in several languages some purely mechanical threepio raced fluidly after hisfriend the artoo unit he thought to himself could be downright it wanted to 
 outside the galactic control center the corridor was crowded with sullenprisoners gathered by imperial troops some lay wounded some dying severalofficers had been separated from the enlisted ranks and stood in a small group bythemselves bestowing belligerent looks and threats on the silent knot of troopsholding them at bay 
 as if on command troops as well as silentas massive capped from came into view from behind a turn in the passage two ofthe heretofore resolute obstinate rebel officers began to shake stopping before oneof the men the towering figure reached out wordlessly a massive hand closedaround the neck and lifted him off the deck the rebel eyes he kept his silence 
 and imperial officer his armored helmet shoved back to reveal a recent scarwhere and energy beam had penetrated his shielding scrambled down out of control room shaking his head briskly nothing sir informationretrieval been wiped clean 
 darth vader acknowledged this news with a barely perceptible nod theimpenetrable mask turned to regard the officer he was torturing fingerscontracted reaching up the prisoner desperately tried to pry them loose but to noavail 
 where is the data you intercepted vader rumbled dangerously what haveyou done with the information tapes 
 information the dangling officer gurgled barely ableto breathe from somewhere deep within he dredged up a squeal of outrage thisis a councilor vessel did you not see our mission 
 chaos take your mission vader growled where are those tapes hesqueezed harder the threat in his grip implicit 
 when he finally replied the voice was a bare choked the commander knows 
 this ship carries the system crest of alderaan vader growled the breath mask leaning close is any of the royal family on board who are youcarrying thick fingers tightened further and the struggles became moreand more frantic his last words were muffled and choked past intelligibility 
 vader was not pleased even though the figure went limp with an finality that hand continued to tighten producing a chilling snappingand popping of bone like a dog padding on plastic then with a disgusted wheezevader finally threw the of the dead man against a far wall severalimperial troops ducked out of the way just in time to avoid the grisly missile 
 the massive form whirled unexpectedly and imperial officers shrank under thatbaleful sculptured component by component until you find those tapes as for thepassengers if any i want them alive he paused a moment then added and men nearly fell over themselves in their haste to necessarilyto carry out orders but simply to retreat from that malevolent presence 
 artoo detoo finally came to a halt in an empty corridor devoid of smoke and thesigns of battle a worried confused threepio pulled up behind him 
 led us through half the ship and to what he broke off staring indisbelief as the squat robot reached up with one clawed limb and snapped the seal ona lifeboat hatch immediately a red warning light came on and a low hootingsounded in the corridor 
 threepio looked wildly in all directions but the passageway remained he looked back artoo was already working his way into the cramped boat was just large enough to hold several humans and its design was not laid out toaccommodate mechanicals artoo had some trouble negotiating the awkward littlecompartment 
 hey a startled threepio called admonishing not permitted in restricted to humans only we just might be able to convince the imperials not rebel programmed and are too valuable to break up but if someone sees youin there we got a chance come on out 
 somehow artoo had succeeded in wedging his body into position in front of theminiature control board he cocked his body slightly and threw a stream of loudbeeps and whistles at his reluctant companion 
 threepio listened he frown but he managed to give a goodimpression of doing so missionwhat mission what are you talking sound like you got an integrated logic terminal left in your more adventures take my chances with the notgetting in there 
 an angry electronic twang came from the artoo call me a mindless philosopher threepio snapped back you glob of grease 
 threepio was concocting an additional rejoinder when an explosion blew out theback wall of the corridor dust and metal debris whooshed through the narrow followed instantly by a series of secondary explosions flames beganjumping hungrily from the exposed interior wall reflection off isolatedpatches of polished skin 
 muttering the electronic equivalent of consigning his soul to the unknown thelanky robot jumped into the audibly as artoo activated the safety door behind smaller robot flipped a series of switches snapped back a cover and pressedthree buttons in a certain sequence with the thunder of explosive latches the lifepod ejected from the crippled fighter 
 when word came over the communicators that the last pocket of resistance onthe rebel ship had been cleaned out the captain of the imperial cruiser relaxedconsiderably he was listening with pleasure to proceedings on captured vesselwhen one of his chief gunnery officers called to him moving to the captain stared into the circular viewscreen and saw a tiny dot dropping awaytoward the fiery world below 
 there goes another pod sir instructions the hand hovered overa computerized energy battery 
 casually confident in the firepower and total control under his command thecaptain studied the nearby readouts monitoring the pod all of them read blank 
 hold your fire lieutenant hija instruments show no life forms aboard release mechanism must have or received a false waste you power he turned away to listen with satisfaction to the reports ofcaptured men and material coming from the rebel ship 
 glare from exploding panels and erupting circuitry reflected crazily off thearmor of the lead storm trooper as he surveyed the passageway ahead he was aboutto turn and call for those behind to follow him forward when he noticed somethingmoving off to one side it appeared to be crouching back in a small dark his pistol ready he moved cautiously forward and peered into the recess 
 a small shivering figure clad in flowing white hugged the back of the recess andstared up at the man now he could see that he faced a young woman and herphysical description fit that of the one individual the dark lord was most interested trooper grinned behind his helmet a lucky encounter for him he would becommended 
 within the armor his head turned slightly directing his voice to the tinycondenser microphone here she is he called to those behind him set for stunforc 
 he never finished the sentence just as he would never receive the once his attention turned from the girl to his communicator hershivering vanished with starling speed the energy pistol he had held out of sightbehind her came up and around as she burst from her hiding place 
 the trooper who had been unlucky enough to find her fell first his head a massof melted bone and metal the same fate met the second armored from coming upfast behind him then a bright green energy pole touched the side and sheslumped instantly to the deck the pistol still locked in her small palm 
 shapes clustered around her one whose arm bore the insigniaof a lower officer knelt and turned her over he studied the paralyzed form with apracticed eye 
 be all right he finally declared looking up his subordinates reportto lord vader 
 threepio stared mesmerized out the small set in the front of the tinyescape pod as the hot yellow eye of tatooine began to swallow them behind them he knew the crippled fighter and the imperial cruiser werereceding to imperceptibility 
 that was fine with him if they landed near a civilized city he would seekelegant employment in a halcyon atmosphere something more befitting his status andtraining these past months had gifted him with entirely too much excitement andunpredictability for a mere machine 
 seemingly random manipulation of the pod controls promised anythingbut a smooth landing however threepio regarded his squat companion withconcern 
 are you sure you know how to pilot this thing 
 artoo replied with a noncommittal whistle that did nothing to alter the jangled state of mind

 book one 
 chapter ii 
 
 anna drawing room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged prince daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father to the entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg was also there she had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions prince son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come 
 the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
 to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna mentioned each name and then left them 
 each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of her majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening 
 the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her upper lip and her mouth seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day 
 the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out her arms to show her dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast 
 soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna 
 you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene 
 what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna 
 one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with hair spectacles the breeches fashionable 
 at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a grandee of time who now lay dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of this greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room 
 it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her 
 pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance 
 anna alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her health anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting man 
 yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible 
 you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the plan chimerical 
 we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile 
 and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe 
 pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing

 chapter 
 
 yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights on coming up from dinner however i dine between twelve and one the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at five on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a walk arrived at garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower 
 on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled 
 wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality at least i would not keep my doors barred in the day time i will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn 
 whet are ye for he shouted t dahn i t fowld go rahnd by th end ut laith if yah went tuh spake tull him 
 is there nobody inside to open the door i hallooed responsively 
 nobbut t missis and nut an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght 
 why cannot you tell her who i am eh joseph 
 me hae noa hend muttered the head vanishing 
 the snow began to drive thickly i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a and a paved area containing a coal shed pump and pigeon cot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute 
 rough weather i remarked afraid mrs heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me 
 she never opened her mouth i stared also at any rate she kept her eyes on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable 
 sit down said the young man gruffly be in soon 
 i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance 
 a beautiful animal i commenced again do you intend parting with the little ones madam 
 they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied 
 ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats 
 a strange choice of favourites she observed scornfully 
 unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening 
 you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the two of the painted canisters 
 her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eyes had they been agreeable in expression they would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his gold 
 i want your help she snapped i can get them for myself 
 i beg your pardon i hastened to reply 
 were you asked to tea she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot 
 i shall be glad to have a cup i answered 
 were you asked she repeated 
 no i said half smiling you are the proper person to ask me 
 she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red under lip pushed out like a ready to cry 
 meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eyes for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr and mrs heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a assiduity in attending on the lady of the house in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state 
 you see sir i am come according to promise i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weatherbound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space 
 half an hour he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snowstorm to ramble about in do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present 
 perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till you spare me one 
 no i could not 
 oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity 
 umph 
 are you going to mak th tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady 
 is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff 
 get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me sir bring forward your chair and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal 
 i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their everyday countenance 
 it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr heathcliff yet venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart 
 my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is amiable lady 
 mrs heathcliff your wife i mean 
 well you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone is that it 
 perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years the other did not look seventeen 
 then it flashed upon clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad must beware how i cause her to regret her choice the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive 
 mrs heathcliff is my said heathcliff corroborating my surmise he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul 
 ah see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour 
 this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice 
 unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead i said she was my therefore she must have married my son 
 and this young man is 
 not my son assuredly 
 heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him 
 my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and counsel you to respect it 
 shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself 
 he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralized the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time 
 the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow 
 i think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance 
 hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff 
 how must i do i continued with rising irritation 
 there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the as she restored the tea canister to its place the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out 
 aw woonder hagh yah can faishion tuh stand thear i idleness un war when all on goan aght bud a nowt and noa use talking niver mend uh yer ill ways bud goa raight tuh t divil like yer mother afore ye 
 i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door mrs heathcliff however checked me by her answer 
 you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf show you how far progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it the red cow die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations 
 oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil 
 no reprobate you are a off or hurt you seriously have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix not say what he shall be done see go looking at you 
 the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress 
 mrs heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face sure you cannot help being do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london 
 take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her it is brief advice but as sound as i can give 
 then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience whisper that it is partly your fault 
 how so i cannot escort you they let me go to the end of the garden wall 
 you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way net to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide 
 who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have 
 are there no boys at the farm 
 no those are all 
 then it follows that i am compelled to stay 
 that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it 
 i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do 
 i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied 
 no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit anyone the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch 
 with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me 
 go with him as far as the park he said 
 go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh 
 a life is of more consequence than one neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected 
 not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him better be quiet 
 then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply 
 hearken hearken cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering 
 he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern 
 maister maister stealing t lantern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him 
 on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me their peril to keep me one minute several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear 
 the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the young scoundrel 
 well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for at t poor lad fair choking wisht wisht you go on so come in and cure that there now hold ye still 
 with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness 
 i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed

 chapter two 
 
 jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies then she remembered her promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little book she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow a green covered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also one the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day 
 in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given 
 girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day 
 then she opened her new book and began to read jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face 
 how good meg is come amy do as they do help you with the hard words and they explain things if we understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example 
 glad mine is blue said amy and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting 
 where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later 
 goodness only knows some poor creeter came and your ma went straight off to see what was needed there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant 
 she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time why where is bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear 
 she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers 
 how nice my handkerchiefs look they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor 
 bless the child gone and put mother on them instead of m march how funny cried jo taking one up 
 that right i thought it was better to do it so because initials are and i want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled 
 all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth 
 mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall 
 amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her 
 where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early 
 laugh at me jo i mean anyone should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and truly trying not to be selfish any more 
 as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle 
 you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and so glad for mine is the handsomest now 
 another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast 
 merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus merry christmas little daughters glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present 
 they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously so glad you came before we began 
 may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly 
 i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked 
 meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate 
 i thought do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime 
 they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party 
 a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm 
 how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in 
 ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy 
 funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing 
 in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english 
 das ist gut die cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning 
 loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels 
 not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table 
 coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor 
 beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit 
 there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work 
 the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels 
 no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society 
 on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began 
 a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred to roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee 
 out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter 
 hither hither from thy home 
 airy sprite i bid thee come 
 born of roses fed on dew 
 charms and potions canst thou brew 
 bring me here with elfin speed 
 the fragrant philter which i need 
 make it sweet and swift and strong 
 spirit answer now my song 
 a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang 
 hither i come 
 from my airy home 
 afar in the silver moon 
 take the magic spell 
 and use it well 
 or its power will vanish soon 
 and dropping a small gilded bottle at the feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play 
 a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on shoulder and was about to leap gracfully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins 
 a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside 
 laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made 
 act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody 
 this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together 
 act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love 
 act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace 
 tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper 
 this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers 
 it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely 
 is it fairies asked amy 
 santa claus said beth 
 mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows 
 aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration 
 all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march 
 the laurence grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we know him exclaimed meg 
 
 
 hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breakfast 
 that boy put it into his head i know he did a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if like to know us but bashful and meg is so prim she let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction 
 you mean the people who live in the big house next door you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says very proud and like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he come mother says very nice though he never speaks to us girls 
 our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun sure he does said jo decidedly 
 i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own 
 a mercy you mother laughed jo looking at her boots but have another play sometime that he can see perhaps help act that be jolly 
 i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest 
 they are lovely but roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the posy in her belt 
 beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father afraid he having such a merry christmas as we are

 cairo a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions in the 
 sky since birth a city teeming with every form of life a strange 
 mysterious wonderful city we superimpose name across the screen 
 cairo 
 int cairo museum of antiquities day 
 deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks rows upon rows of towering 
 bookshelves filled with literature on the antiquities standing at the top 
 of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the 
 bookshelves is a rather uninteresting british girl 
 long boring dress your typical prudish nightmare this is 
 evelyn carnarvon going to fall in love with her 
 evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows the dust off it 
 then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the 
 letter o then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads 
 the title 
 evelyn 
 tuthmosis now how did you get up here 
 carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her shoulder to 
 the bookshelf behind her where all the titles begin with the letter to 
 then she looks down a long way to the bottom evelyn gently sets the 
 other books down on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
 across the aisle with the tuthmosis book a little too far so she 
 stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder with 
 her fingertips almost got it closer now closer 
 and when the ladder pulls away from the shelf evelyn yelps flings 
 the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder which stands straight 
 up evelyn holds her breath swaying precariously a long beat and then 
 she loses her balance the ladder swings around and evelyn starts 
 stiltwalking down the aisle 
 evelyn 
 oheiugm ahhhhhh 
 the ladder crosses the aisle does an about face and heads back the way it 
 came evelyn clings to the top struggling for balance the ladder teeters 
 out into the main aisle and picks up speed evelyn screams as it does a 
 spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
 bookshelf evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily 
 and when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes into the next 
 bookshelf evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor she looks 
 up just as the domino effect each bookshelf crashing into the 
 next and onward it goes bookshelf after bookshelf thousands of volumes 
 flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor it finally ends as 
 the last shelf crashes into a wall eyes are closed she opens one 
 eye looks left then right then opens the other eye and stares at the 
 huge mess 
 evelyn 
 oops 
 the egyptian curator storms in 
 curator 
 look at this sons of the messiah give 
 me frogs flies locusts anything but this 
 compared to you the other plagues were a joy 
 evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books 
 evelyn 
 sorry it was an accident 
 curator 
 when ramesses destroyed syria it was an 
 accident you are a catastrophe why do i 
 put up with you 
 evelyn turns to him trying to contain herself 
 evelyn

 write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs 
 and hieratic and the only person within a 
 thousand miles who knows how to properly code 
 and catalogue this library 
 curator 
 who needs smart women i put up with you because 
 your mother and father were our finest patrons 
 allah rest their souls now straighten up this 
 mess 
 the curator storms out evelyn just stands there steaming and then she 
 hears a noise and quickly turns around a beat 
 evelyn 
 hello 
 quiet eerie and then she hears it again like feet slowly shuffling 
 across the floor coming from a nearby gallery 
 evelyn 
 abdul mohammed bob 
 evelyn walks through the stacks and enters 
 int the ramesseum 
 filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom very dark 
 and quiet in here the only light is from flickering torches at either end 
 of the spooky gallery 
 the noise again from the far side of the room feet slowly shuffling 
 plodding across the floor evelyn grabs a torch looks a statue 
 of anubis another of horus they stare down at evelyn who is starting to 
 get scared now she walks down the aisle past a closed sarcophagus past 
 cases of ancient artifacts past another sarcophagus only this one is 
 open evelyn freezes swallows hard nervously looks around to see who 
 could have opened it then she slowly leans forward with the torch and 
 peers inside 
 a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her evelyn 
 screams drops the torch and backs away scared out of her wits and then 
 coming from inside the sarcophagus she hears a man laughing her eyes 
 narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the mummy laughing his ass 
 off half drunk 
 evelyn 
 you you 
 jonathan 
 drunkard fool please call 
 me something original 
 meet jonathan carnarvon as he crawls out of the sarcophagus evelyn pulls 
 a cigarette out of the mouth 
 evelyn 
 have you no respect for the dead 
 jonathan 
 right now i only wish to join them 
 he grins drunkenly evelyn punches him hard in the chest 
 evelyn 
 well i wish do it sooner rather than 
 later before you ruin my 
 career the way ruined yours 
 jonathan 
 my dear sweet baby sister have you 
 know that at this moment my career is on a high note 
 he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb 
 evelyn

 scrounging around egypt and what have you

 jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket 
 jonathan 
 oh yes i do i have something right here 
 evelyn 
 oh no not another worthless trinket 
 jonathan if i bring one more 
 piece of junk to the curator to try 
 and sell for you 
 jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key to 
 sarcophagus and coffin evelyn is instantly curious she grabs the box out 
 of his hand 
 evelyn 
 where did you get this 
 jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile 
 jonathan 
 on a dig down in thebes 
 evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself as she 
 translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it jonathan licks his 
 lips in anticipation 
 jonathan 
 my whole life never found 
 anything evy tell me 
 found something 
 fingers play with the various little slats on the box shifting 
 them this way and that way like a puzzle box then suddenly it 
 unfolds itself turning itself into the key sitting 
 inside the open is a folded piece of golden papyrus an ancient 
 map 
 evelyn 
 jonathan 
 jonathan 
 yes 
 evelyn 
 i think you found something 
 int office day 
 the curator sits at his desk staring through a eyepiece at the evelyn hovers behind him excited 
 evelyn 
 see the cartouche there the official 
 royal seal of seti the first sure of it 
 curator 
 perhaps 
 jonathan leans in from across the desk 
 jonathan 
 two questions who the hell is seti the first 
 and was he rich 
 evelyn 
 he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom 
 said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all 
 jonathan 
 alright good good i like this fellow 
 like him very much 
 the curator picks up the map actually the exact same map that we 
 established in the opening scenes of the movie 
 evelyn 
 already dated it this map 
 is almost four thousand years old 
 and the hieratics over here 
 inhales deeply 
 hamunaptra 
 the curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he recovers 
 curator 
 my dear girl be ridiculous 
 we are scholars not treasure 
 hunters hamunaptra is a myth 
 jonathan 
 are we talking about the hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes the city of the dead where the early 
 pharaohs were said to have 
 hidden the wealth of egypt 
 jonathan 
 right right in a big underground treasure 
 chamber everybody knows the story the entire 
 necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand on 
 command a flick of the switch and the 
 whole place could disappear beneath the dunes 
 evelyn 
 all we know is that the city mysteriously 
 vanished around 
 the curator holds the map closer to the burning 
 curator 
 as the americans would say all fairy 
 tales and hokum 
 the map accidentally catches on fire the curator throws it to the 
 floor jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out lifts it up 
 the left third of the map is now missing 
 jonathm 
 you burned it you burned off the part with the lost city 
 curator 
 for the best sure many men have 
 wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of 
 hamunaptra no one has ever found it most have 
 never returned 
 jonathan devastated 
 you killed my map 
 curator 
 sure it was a fake anyway 
 surprised at you miss 
 carnarvon to be so fooled 
 the curator reaches for the evelyn quickly snatches it off the 
 desk and gives him a very angry suspicious look

 she puts her hand over her mouth covering her smile 
 
 general 
 embarrassed straightening his bedrobe 
 perfectly alright 
 
 to the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 he bows and leaves 
 
 doctor 
 bowing smiling at the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 ann 
 goodnight doctor 
 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes 
 the truck continues through the city but ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front as it is stopped she hops out running to the footpath as the truck screeches away she leans against a tree yawning then continues on 
 crossing a street she walks straight across the passenger cabin of a carriage parked alongside the pavement to the bewilderment of the passengers and driver the cab drives away as ann continues on 
 a light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of the building the carriage was parked in front of

 her pov lester comes out the front door dressed in abusiness suit and carrying a briefcase fumbling with his tie jane is close behind him buttoning her flannel shirt her knapsack slung over her shoulder 
 carolyn frowns at both of them

 carolynwell congratulations succeeded admirably 
 briefcase suddenly springs open his papers and files spilling onto the driveway as he drops to his knees to gather everything jane sidesteps around him 
 janenice going dad 
 lester looks up her sheepishly then at carolyn 
 his pov she looks down at us slightly contemptuous but alsobored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago 
 lesteri keep meaning to get this thing fixed 
 he smiles trying to lighten the moment but expression change she opens the door and gets into the drivers seat jane takes the passenger seat and lester climbs into the back the ml starts to slowly back out of the driveway 
 lester my family and this is my think i miss it so much 
 int ml a short time later 
 carolyn is driving jane stares out the window lester is asleep in the back seat clint black sings desperado on the stereo 
 janewhy are we listening to this music 
 just what was on 
 jane fiddles the tuner searching for another suddenly catches eye 
 her pov an advertisement on a bus stop bench shows a silver man smiling a toothy smile it reads leonard kane the real estate king highest sales record three years straight we recognize him as the man seated next to carolyn in court during trial 
 carolyn glare at the advertisement as she drives past itobviously bothers her 
 janei see how you people can listen to that hillbilly crap it makes me want to buy a gun and shoot up a burger king

 he has a paper cup of coffee in one hand haphazardly holdingit against his knee slowly it tips over spilling onto his pants leg he remains asleep 
 lester right lost something very important not exactly sure what it is but i know i always fell this sedated 
 finally lester opens one eye 
 pov from the front of the path train zooming along aboveground unnaturally fast heading toward a tunnel 
 lester you know what never too late to get it back 
 and we accelerate into the tunnel and blackness 
 int office building dayclose on a computer monitor scrolling copy moving by too quickly for us to read but we can make out words here and there marketing profits strategy etc 
 lester sits at his workstation in a beige cubicle surrounded by several identical beige cubicles staring at the monitor and talking on a headset phone the light friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered expression on his face 
 
 lesterhello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine calling for actually already left a message about four messages to be exact i understand but i have questions about the new product launch that your press release quite cover 
 brad an affable man in his early thirties appears behindlester lester is immediately aware of his presence

 int office moments later 
 brad is seated behind his desk

 lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager been sent to the office 
 lestersure times are tight and you need to free up cash gotta spend money to make money 
 bradexactly 
 brad stands ready to usher lester out but lester remainsseated 
 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him

 lesterexpendable

 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music

 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school

 janeno dad it was beat 
 lesterwant to know how things went at my job 
 now she looks at him as if lost his mind 
 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely 
 what do you expect you all of a sudden be my best friend just because got a problem 
 she gets up and heads toward the kitchen

 on video looking at lester and jane through greenhouse windows into the kitchen we hear what saying but obvious not going well jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves we follow her out the door then the camera jerks back to lester calling after her 
 close on the lens of a portable video camera as wepull back the camera drops down to reveal ricky fitts whom we recognize as the young man in jail at the beginning his short hair and starched clothes give him a appearance we linger on his placid face for a moment then 
 int burnham kitchen continuous 
 lester stands at the sink rinsing off his plate his facedark his head suddenly jerks up and he looks out the window as if he realizes he s being watched 
 his pov looking at the pint where ricky was just standing but no longer there 
 lester frowns then turns off the faucet grabs a towel anddries his hands he tosses the towel on the snack bar on his way out where it lands next to a framed photograph 
 we zoom slowly toward the photograph of lester carolyn and a jane taken several years earlier at an amusement park starling how happy they look

 the law of club and fang 
 
 
 first day on the yea beach was like a nightmare every hour was filled with shock and surprise he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial no lazy life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored here was neither peace nor rest nor a safety all was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril there was imperative need to be constantly alert for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang 
 he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgettable lesson it is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it curly was the victim they were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a wolf though not half so large as she there was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and face was ripped open from eye to jaw 
 it was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away but there was more to it than this thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside he met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet she never regained them this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for they closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies 
 so sudden was it and so unexpected that buck was taken aback he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing and he saw francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them it did not take long two minutes from the time curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart standing over her and cursing horribly the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep so that was the way no fair play once down that was the end of you well he would see to it that he never went down spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred 
 before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly he received another shock francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles it was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel he buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange francois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience while dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped hindquarters whenever he was in error spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels 
 three very good dogs francois told perrault dat buck him pull like hell i teach him quick as anything 
 by afternoon perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his dispatches returned with two more dogs billee and joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both sons of the one mother though they were they were different as day and night one fault was his excessive good nature while joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye buck received them in comradely fashion dave ignored them while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when sharp teeth scored his flank but no matter how spitz circled joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically incarnation of belligerent fear so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp 
 by evening perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect he was called which means the angry one like dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even spitz left him alone he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky enough to discover he did not like to be approached on his blind side of this offense buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down forever after buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more his only apparent ambition like was to be left alone though as buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition 
 that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping the tent illumined by a candle glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain and when he as a matter of course entered it both perrault and francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested 
 finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own teammates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick face with his warm wet tongue 
 another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and wasted effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams 
 nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before 
 a shout from francois hailed his appearance what i say the cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn quick as anything 
 perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important dispatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck 
 three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the yea canyon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight 
 dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz 
 buck had been purposely placed between dave and so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them 
 it was a hard run up the canyon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled 
 that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault traveled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all 
 day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sundried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition 
 he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for misdeed 
 this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feeling but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper 
 not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defense of judge riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defense of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them 
 his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug 
 and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness and the cold and dark 
 thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself

lionfish nov chapter two warningcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing the little creature on the bed had large ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning 
 
 as they stared at each other harry heard voice from the hall 
 
 may i take your coats mr and mrs mason 
 
 the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and 
 
 er hello said harry nervously 
 
 harry potter said the creature in a voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir such an honor it is 
 
 you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you 
 
 dobby sir just dobby dobby the said the creature 
 
 oh really said harry er i want to be rude or anything but this a great time for me to have a in my bedroom 
 
 aunt petunias high false laugh sounded from the living room the elf hung his head 
 
 not that not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason here 
 
 oh yes sir said dobby earnestly dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin 
 
 sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed 
 
 to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears 
 
 down he wailed never never ever 
 
 harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter 
 
 sorry he whispered i mean to offend you or anything 
 
 offend dobby choked the elf dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal 
 
 harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration 
 
 you have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up 
 
 dobby shook his head then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage 
 
 dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir 
 
 your family 
 
 the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a bound to serve one house and one family forever 
 
 do they know here asked harry curiously 
 
 dobby shuddered 
 
 oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir 
 
 but they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door 
 
 dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments 
 
 but why you leave escape 
 
 a must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir 
 
 harry stared 
 
 and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said this makes the dursleys sound almost human anyone help you i 
 
 almost at once harry wished he spoken dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude 
 
 please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know here 
 
 harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew 
 
 harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish not even top of my year at hogwarts hermione she 
 
 but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful 
 
 harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over 
 
 voldemort said harry 
 
 dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people like it my friend ron 
 
 he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too 
 
 dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights 
 
 dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again 
 
 harry nodded and eyes suddenly shone with tears 
 
 ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts 
 
 there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle voice 
 
 harry stammered but got to go back term starts on september first all keeping me going you know what like here i belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts 
 
 no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger 
 
 why said harry in surprise 
 
 there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir 
 
 what terrible things said harry at once plotting them 
 
 dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall 
 
 all right cried harry grabbing the arm to stop him you tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this got anything to do with vol sorry with has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as head tilted worryingly close to the wall again 
 
 slowly dobby shook his head 
 
 not not sir 
 
 but eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost 
 
 he got a brother has he 
 
 dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever 
 
 well then i think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is you 
 
 dobby bowed his head 
 
 albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard powers rival those of at the height of his strength but sir voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore powers no decent wizard 
 
 and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps 
 
 a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke 
 
 quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned 
 
 what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and wish never been born boy 
 
 he stomped from the room 
 
 shaking harry let dobby out of the closet 
 
 see what like here he said see why got to go back to hogwarts the only place got well i think got friends 
 
 friends who even write to harry potter said dobby slyly 
 
 i expect just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends been writing to me 
 
 dobby shuffled his feet 
 
 harry potter be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best 
 
 have you been stopping my letters 
 
 dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out neat writing untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid 
 
 dobby blinked anxiously up at harry 
 
 harry potter be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir 
 
 harry listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach 
 
 harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you go back sir 
 
 no said harry angrily give me my 
 
 then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly 
 
 before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs 
 
 mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason been dying to hear 
 
 harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear 
 
 aunt masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby 
 
 no croaked harry please kill me 
 
 harry potter must say not going back to school 
 
 dobby please 
 
 say it sir 
 
 i 
 
 dobby gave him a tragic look 
 
 then dobby must do it sir for harry own good 
 
 the pudding fell to the floor with a crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished 
 
 there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt pudding 
 
 at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean 
 
 uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it been for the owl 
 
 aunt petunia was just passing around a box of mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke 
 
 harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes 
 
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it 
 
 harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings

 we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community muggles is a serious offense under section of the international confederation of of secrecy

 harry looked up from the letter and gulped 
 
 you tell us you allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes forgot to mention it slipped your mind i daresay 
 
 he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well got news for you boy locking you up never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out expel you 
 
 and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs 
 
 uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on window he himself fitted a in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock 
 
 three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him 
 
 what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an low now that the dursleys knew they going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going probably starve to death anyway 
 
 the rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust 
 
 no good turning your beak up at it all got said harry grimly 
 
 he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup 
 
 supposing he was still alive in another four weeks hat would happen if he turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go 
 
 the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep 
 
 he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him 
 
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out trying to sleep 
 
 he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a someone 
 
 ron weasley was outside window

lionfish nov chapter two aunt big mistakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a television a present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually 
 
 harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately 
 
 no need to tell us no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair 
 
 he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed 
 
 the reporter had reappeared 
 
 the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today 
 
 hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you tell us where that escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now 
 
 aunt petunia who was bony and whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring neighbors 
 
 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders 
 
 no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry 
 
 got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing thick blond hair bought him a lovely new 
 
 uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder 
 
 see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen 
 
 harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door 
 
 uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat 
 
 not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him 
 
 like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something 
 
 uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously 
 
 third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry 
 
 so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
 
 i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush 
 
 and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon 
 
 well said harry choosing his words carefully be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits 
 
 st secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle voice 
 
 exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle large purple face a lot to remember have to make it sound convincing i what if i accidentally let something slip 
 
 get the stuffing knocked out of you you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground 
 
 knocking the stuffing out of me make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly 
 
 uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce 
 
 but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like normal and everything 
 
 harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
 
 right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during visit if at the end of it toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form 
 
 he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out 
 
 harry return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle heed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake 
 
 hedwig he said gloomily going to have to clear off for a week go with errol look after you ill write him a note explaining and look at me like that large amber eyes were reproachful not my fault the only way be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione 
 
 ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe 
 
 but harry have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
 
 do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall 
 
 harry see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be 
 
 all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path 
 
 get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry 
 
 a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open 
 
 on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and bulldog 
 
 my dudders roared aunt marge my neffy poo 
 
 dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek 
 
 harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp note clutched in his fat fist 
 
 petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone 
 
 uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door 
 
 tea marge he said and what will ripper take 
 
 ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could 
 
 
 by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals 
 
 looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked 
 
 oh got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge retired now good for him to have something to do but i leave poor old ripper he pines if away from me 
 
 ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt attention to harry for the first time 
 
 so she barked still here are you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you have done it myself have gone straight to an orphanage if been dumped on my doorstep 
 
 harry was bursting to say that rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile 
 
 you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon 
 
 st said uncle vernon promptly a institution for hopeless cases 
 
 i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st boy she barked across the table 
 
 er 
 
 uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt back 
 
 yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time 
 
 excellent said aunt marge i have this nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is needed in cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often 
 
 oh yeah said harry loads of times 
 
 aunt marge narrowed her eyes 
 
 i still like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly hitting you hard enough petunia write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this case 
 
 perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptly 
 
 heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh 
 
 
 
 as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person 
 
 you blame yourself for the way the turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if something rotten on the inside nothing anyone can do about it 
 
 harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade say anything rise 
 
 aunt marge reached for her glass of wine 
 
 one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if something wrong with the bitch be something wrong with the pup 
 
 at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping 
 
 marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right 
 
 not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip 
 
 but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could 
 
 outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since lost control and made something explode he afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form the only thing at stake if he carried on like that be in trouble with the ministry of magic 
 
 harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record exactly clean either only last summer gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
 
 he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way 
 
 
 
 harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal 
 
 at last at long last the final evening of stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy 
 
 can i tempt you marge 
 
 aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red 
 
 just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than thatand a bit the ticket 
 
 dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out 
 
 aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia normally just a for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a boy she went on winking at dudley be a man dudders like your father yes have a spot more brandy vernon 
 
 now this one here 
 
 she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly 
 
 this got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred 
 
 harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers 
 
 it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt bony hand with her one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and the result right in front of us 
 
 harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he remember what came next aunt voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle drills 
 
 this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents 
 
 he work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed 
 
 as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a lazy scrounger who 
 
 he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life 
 
 more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on 
 
 no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect 
 
 they die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet 
 
 they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little 
 
 but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami 
 
 marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 uncle vernon seized one of feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle leg 
 
 harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters 
 
 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter two the scarcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a wire to his skin 
 
 he sat up one hand still on his scar the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window 
 
 harry ran his fingers over the scar again it was still painful he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair he examined the scar of his reflection more closely it looked normal but it was still stinging 
 
 harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken it had seemed so realthere had been two people he knew and one he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember 
 
 the dim picture of a darkened room came to himthere had been a snake on a hearth ruga small man called peter nicknamed wormtailand a cold high voicethe voice of lord voldemort harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought 
 
 he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossibleall harry knew was that at the moment when chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in his scar 
 
 and who had the old man been for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground it was all becoming confused harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the nameand they had been plotting to kill someone elsehim 
 
 harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there as it happened there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night the pictures in this book were all moving men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another 
 
 harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in opinion the best sport in the world distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below 
 
 privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there a living creature in sight not even a cat 
 
 and yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venomous fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble 
 
 no the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible 
 
 harry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room 
 
 harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless 
 
 asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable 
 
 and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it been for voldemort harry would still have had parents 
 
 harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous 
 
 it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again 
 
 but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting 
 
 at once hermione voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky 
 
 your scar hurt harry really seriouswrite to professor dumbledore nd go and check common magical ailments and afflictionsmaybe something in there about curse scars 
 
 yes that would be advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he write 
 
 dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry potter 
 
 even inside his head the words sounded stupid 
 
 and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron reaction and in a moment red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression 
 
 your scar hurt butbut be near you now can he i know you be trying to do you in again be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a ask dad 
 
 mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar 
 
 harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic 
 
 and then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he believe it had taken so long sirius 
 
 harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago 
 
 there was a simple reason for complete absence from life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story 
 
 for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever 
 
 nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent 
 
 harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all right 
 
 lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 thanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here diet going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he even got part three to take his mind off things 
 okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to 
 a weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward 
 send this with hedwig when she gets back off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me 
 harry 
 yes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast

lionfish nov chapter two a peck of owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway

lionfish nov chapter two endcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old wrappings in the tall grass 
 
 but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass 
 
 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead 
 
 hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is 
 
 but you stayed 
 
 yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do 
 
 i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him 
 
 mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine 
 
 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders 
 
 on she began in tones of outrage 
 
 think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff i 
 
 the dark initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong 
 
 but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you 
 
 my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you 
 
 he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful 
 
 does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry 
 
 that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most preciousif lucius 
 
 you you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister 
 
 there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done 
 
 but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape 
 
 my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix andforgive meyou speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not 
 
 they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters you 
 
 i am not the i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off 
 
 he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften 
 
 you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why 
 
 have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape 
 
 he lately we i am asking you snape 
 
 if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible 
 
 you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered 
 
 i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago 
 
 but why did you keep him alive 
 
 have you not understood me it was only protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark attack indeed many of the dark old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle 
 
 of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand 
 
 and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still 
 
 i have played my part well said snape and you overlook greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open armsthough as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizardoh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord 
 
 bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister 
 
 now you came to ask me for help narcissa 
 
 narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair 
 
 yes severus think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and 
 
 she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids 
 
 the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is very secret but 
 
 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter two in memorandumcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door 
 
 what the c 
 
 he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudleys idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap 
 
 it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him 
 
 harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood 
 
 he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit 
 
 harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk 
 
 it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauders map and the locket with the note signed inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it 
 
 this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer 
 
 he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment 
 
 as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for 
 
 albus dumbledore remembered 
 by elphias doge 
 i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and attack upon three young muggles 
 
 albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that albus too was a they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years 
 
 in a matter of months however albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching 
 
 he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions 
 
 three years after we had started at hogwarts albuss brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albuss mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me 
 
 that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my years travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana 
 
 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of 
 
 albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding worlds that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him 
 
 harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation 
 
 he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledores childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly skrewt 
 
 he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harrys past harrys future harrys plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly 
 
 what do you see when you look in the mirror 
 
 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks 
 
 after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were todays daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror 
 
 harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed 
 
 across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried 
 
 dumbledore c the truth at last 
 coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end 
 
 the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside 
 
 harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on 
 
 in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip 
 
 well of course dumbledore is a biographers dream says skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many 
 
 skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledores mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat 
 
 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need 
 
 i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledores that skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card 
 
 skeeter throws back her head and laughs 
 
 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout 
 
 and yet elphias doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledores long and extraordinary life 
 
 oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth 
 
 the advance publicity for skeeters biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask 
 
 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledores brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago 
 
 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the father c dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken 
 
 family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledores many magical discoveries 
 
 he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers 
 
 but the importance of some of dumbledores achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald 
 
 oh now im glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile im afraid those who go over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly 
 
 skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other 
 
 oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests c well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that had returned 
 
 oh yes weve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter 
 
 which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledores final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died 
 
 well i dont want to say too much c its all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once theyve read my book 
 
 on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledores legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero 
 
 
 
 
 harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin 
 
 he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from ritas article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for 
 
 lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously 
 
 harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him 
 
 a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunias choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him 
 
 he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a great grief 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story really consists of two parts the first part might be left out but it gives us a few particulars and these are useful we were staying in the country at a seat where it happened that the master was absent for a few days in the meantime there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her and came she said to dispose of shares in her she had her papers with her and we advised her to put them in an envelope and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the knight c 
 she listened to us attentively seized the pen paused and begged us to repeat the direction slowly we complied and she wrote but in the midst of the general war she struck fast sighed deeply and said i am only a woman her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor his outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back 
 he bite said the lady he has no teeth he is like one of the family faithful and grumpy but the latter is my fault for they have teased him they play at wedding and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid and too much for him poor old fellow and she delivered her papers and took puggie upon her arm and this is the first part of the story which might have been left out 
 puggie died the second part it was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town and put up at the inn our windows looked into the which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks in one half were many skins and hides raw and tanned here was all the apparatus necessary to carry on a tannery and it belonged to the widow puggie had died in the morning and was to be buried in this part of the yard the grandchildren of the widow that is of the widow for puggie had never been married filled up the grave and it was a beautiful grave it must have been quite pleasant to lie there the grave was bordered with pieces of and strewn over with sand quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle with the neck upwards and that was not at all allegorical 
 the children danced round the grave and the eldest of the boys among them a practical youngster of seven years made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of for all who lived in the lane the price of admission was to be a trouser button for every boy would be sure to have one and each might also give one for a little girl this proposal was adopted by acclamation 
 and all the children out of the lane yes even out of the little lane at the back flocked to the place and each gave a button 
 many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one suspender but then they had seen grave and the sight was worth much more 
 but in front of the close to the entrance stood a little girl clothed in rags very pretty to look at with curly hair and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them the child said not a word nor did she cry but each time the little door was opened she gave a long long look into the yard she had not a button that she knew right well and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away then she sat down held her little brown hands before her eyes and burst into tears this girl alone had not seen grave it was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience 
 we saw this from above and looked at from above how many a grief of our own and of others can make us smile that is the story and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the from the window

 of unity in religion 
 religion being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is 
 well contained within the true band of unity the quarrels and divisions about 
 religion were evils unknown to the heathen the reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief 
 for you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets but the true god haul this attribute that he is a jealous god and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what means 
 the fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of god which is all in all are 
 two me one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within for the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals yea more than corruption of manners for as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humour so in the spiritual so that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach of unity and therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith ecce in deserto another saith ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in ears nolite exire go not out the doctor of the gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad and certainly it is lime better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners it is but a light thing to be vouched in so serious a matter but yet it expressed well the deformity 
 there is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book the moms dance of heretics for indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things as for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containe infinite blessings it establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience and it turneth the labours of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion 
 concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly 
 there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrement between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our saviour himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention 
 this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of me point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife 
 about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers 
 coat indeed had no seam but the vesture was of divers colours whereupon he saith in veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an subtlety and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious then substantial 
 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 m myriel becomes m welcome 
 the episcopal palace of d adjoins the hospital 
 the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abbe of simore who had been bishop of d in 
 this palace was a genuine seignorial residence everything about it had a grand apartments of the bishop the the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees in the a long and superb gallery which was situated on the and opened on the gardens m henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles brulart de genlis archbishop prince antoine de mesgrigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore de lerins francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar de sabran de forcalquier bishop seignor of glandeve and jean soanen priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishop seignor of senez the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the th of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble 
 the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden 
 three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house 
 monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment 
 monseigneur 
 that was the number which i counted said the bishop 
 the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other 
 that is what i observed 
 the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them 
 so it seems to me 
 and then when there is a ray of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents 
 that was what i said to myself 
 in case of have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at know not what to do 
 that is the thought which occurred to me 
 what would you have monseigneur said the director 
 one must resign self 
 this conversation took place in the gallery on the 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital 
 monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold 
 exclaimed the stupefied director 
 the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes 
 it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself 
 then raising his voice 
 hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something there is evidently a mistake here 
 there are of you in five or six small rooms 
 there are three of us here and we have room for sixty 
 there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours 
 give me back my house you are at home here 
 on the following day the patients were installed in the palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital 
 m myriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution 
 his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage 
 m myriel received from the state in his quality of bishop a salary of fifteen thousand francs 
 on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner we transcribe here a note made by his own hand 
 note on the regulation of my household expenses 
 for the little seminary livres 
 society of the mission 
 for the lazarists of montdidier 
 seminary for foreign missions in paris 
 congregation of the holy spirit 
 religious establishments of the holy land 
 charitable maternity societies 
 extra for that of arles 
 work for the amelioration of prisons 
 work for the relief and delivery of prisoners 
 to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 
 addition to the salary of the poor teachers of thediocese 
 public granary of the 
 congregation of the ladies of d of manosque and of sisteron for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls 
 for the poor 
 my personal expenses 
 total 
 m myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses 
 this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine 
 this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church she simply loved and venerated him 
 when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence 
 their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little 
 it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine made fifteen hundred francs a year 
 on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted 
 and when a village curate came to d the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine 
 one day after he had been in d about three months the bishop said 
 and still i am quite cramped with it all 
 i should think so exclaimed madame magloire 
 monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese 
 it was customary for bishops in former days 
 hold cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire 
 and he made his demand 
 some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading 
 allowance to m the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits 
 this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d wrote to m bigot de preameneu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines 
 expenses of carriage 
 what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants 
 expenses of journeys 
 what is the use of these trips in the first place 
 next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts 
 there are no roads no one travels otherwise than on horseback 
 even the bridge between durance and can barely support these priests are all thus greedy and avaricious 
 this man played the good priest when he first came 
 now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days 
 oh all this priesthood things will not go well m le comte until the emperor has freed us from these rascals 
 down with the pope 
 matters were getting embroiled with rome for my part i am for caesar alone etc etc 
 on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire good said she to mademoiselle baptistine monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all he has regulated all his charities 
 now here are three thousand francs for us 
 at last 
 that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms 
 expenses of carriage and circuit 
 for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital livres 
 for the maternity charitable society of aix 
 for the maternity charitable society of draguignan 
 for foundlings 
 for orphans 
 total 
 such was m budget 
 as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage bans dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy 
 after a time offerings of money flowed in 
 those who had and those who lacked knocked at m latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit 
 in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress 
 considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities 
 far from it 
 as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received 
 it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any 
 then he stripped himself 
 the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters the poor people of the had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenomens of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him 
 moreover this appellation pleased him 
 i like that name said he 
 bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur 
 we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original

 it was an old saying that you could burn your eyes out faster by staringstraight and hard at the flatlands of tatooine than by looking directly atits two huge suns themselves so powerful was the penetrating glare reflected fromthose endless wastes despite the flare life could and did exist in the flatlandsformed by seabeds one thing made it possible the reintroductionof water 
 for human purposes however the water of tatooine was only marginallyaccessible the atmosphere yielded its moisture with reluctance it had to becoaxed down out of the hard blue forced yanked down to the parchedsurface two figures whose concern was obtaining that moisture were standing on aslight rise of one of those inhospitable flats one of the pair was stiff and vaporator sunk securely through sand and into deeper rock the figurenext to it was a food deal more animated though no less 
 luke skywalker was twice the age of the vaporator but much lesssecure at the moment he was swearing softly at a recalcitrant valve adjuster on thetemperamental device from time to time he resorted to some unsubtle pounding inplace of using the appropriate tool neither method worked very well luke wassure that the lubricants used on the vaporator went out of their way to attract seductively to small abrasive particles with an oily gleam he wipedsweat from his forehead and leaned back for a moment the most prepossessingthing about the young man was his name a light breeze tugged at his shaggy hairand baggy work tunic as he regarded the device no point in staying angry at it hecounseled himself only an unintelligent machine 
 as luke considered his predicament a third figure appeared scooting out frombehind the vaporator to fumble awkwardly at the damaged section only three of thetreadwell model six arms were functioning and these had seen more wearthan the boots on feet the machine moved with unsteady 
 luke gazed at it sadly then inclined his head to study the sky still no sign of acloud and he knew there never would be unless he got that vaporator working hewas about to try once again when a small intense gleam of light caught his he slipped the carefully cleaned set of macrobinoculars from his utility beltand focused the lenses skyward 
 for long moments he stared wishing all the while that he had a real telescopeinstead of the binocs as he stared vaporators the heat and the remainingchores were forgotten clipping the binoculars back onto his belt luke turned anddashed for the landspeeder halfway to the vehicle he thought to call behind him 
 hurry up he shouted impatiently what are you waiting for get it ingear 
 the treadwell started toward him hesitated and then commenced spinning in atight circle smoke belching from every joint luke shouted further instruction thenfinally gave up in disgust when he realized that it would take more than words tomotivate the treadwell again 
 for a moment luke hesitated at leaving the machine he argued tohimself its vital components were obviously shot so he jumped into thelandspeeder causing the recently repaired repulsion floater to list alarmingly to oneside until he was able to equalize weight distribution by sliding behind the its altitude slightly above the sandy ground the transportvehicle steadied itself like a boat in a heavy sea luke gunned the engine whichwhined in protest and sand erupted behind the floater as he aimed the craft toward thedistant town of anchorhead 
 behind him a pitiful beacon of black smoke from the burning robot continued torise into the clear desert air it be there when luke returned there werescavengers of metal as well as flesh in the wide wastes of tatooine 
 metal and stone structures bleached white by the glaze of twin tatoo i and iihuddled together tightly for company as much as for protection they formed thenexus of the widespread farming community of anchorhead 
 presently the dusty unpaved streets were quiet deserted sandflies buzzedlazily in the cracked eaves of pourstone building a dog barked in the distance thesole sign of habitation until a lone old woman appeared and started across the metallic sun shawl was pulled tight around her 
 something made her look up tired eyes squinting into the distance the soundsuddenly leaped in volume as a shining rectangular shape came roaring around a farcorner her eyes popped as the vehicle bore down on her showing no sign ofaltering its path she had to scramble to get out of its way 
 panting and waving an angry fist after the landspeeder she raised her voice overthe sound of its passage you kids ever learn to slow down 
 luke might have seen her but he certainly hear her in both cases hisattention was focused elsewhere as he pulled up behind a low long concrete coils and rods jutted from its top and sides relentless sand wavesbroke in frozen yellow spume against the walls no one had bothered toclear them away there was no point they would only return again the followingday 
 luke slammed the front door aside and shouted hey 
 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 chapter iii 
 
 anna reception was in full swing the spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole companyhad settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formedround the abbe another of young people was grouped round thebeautiful princess helene prince daughter and the littleprincess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plumpfor her age the third group was gathered round mortemart and annapavlovna 
 the vicomte was a young man with soft features andpolished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but outof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him upas a treat to her guests as a clever maitre serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seenit in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna servedup to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarlychoice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussingthe murder of the duc the vicomte said that the had perished by his own magnanimity and that there wereparticular reasons for hatred of him 
 ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv inthe sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte 
 the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingnessto comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyoneto listen to his tale 
 the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to ofthe guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she toanother how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to athird and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a joint of roast beefon a hot dish 
 the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 
 come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother group 
 the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile withwhich she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectlybeautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmedwith moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair andsparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciouslyallowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure andshapely shoulders back and bosom which in the fashion of those dayswere very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of aballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was solovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but onthe contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all toovictorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminishits effect 
 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile 
 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said inclining his head 
 the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time thestory was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautifulround arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at herstill more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress andwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna atonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
 the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
 wait a moment get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag 
 there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself inher seat 
 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her work 
 prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circleand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 
 le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact thatin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his featureswere like his but while in her case everything was lit up bya joyous youthful and constant smile of by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on thecontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen while his body was thin and weak his and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions 
 not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak 
 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 chapter 
 
 while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly i asked the reason she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious 
 too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed the whole furniture consisted of a chair a and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and everyone else 
 the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and again to catherine linton 
 in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a bore the inscription catherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a least the appearance of every morsel of blank that the printer had left some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend yet powerfully sketched an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics 
 an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to heathcliff is and i are going to took our initiatory step this evening 
 all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable anything but reading their bibles answer for myself and the unhappy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers 
 you forget you have a master here says the tyrant demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the palaver that we should be ashamed of we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks 
 t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath nut und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye dahn ill childer good books eneugh if read em sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls 
 saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub 
 maister hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither miss riven th back off th helmet uh salvation un pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh t brooad way to destruction fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait ech th owd man ud uh laced em goan 
 hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter a pleasant then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here 
 
 
 i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose 
 how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i give over poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place 
 
 i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print i saw a red ornamented times seven and the first of the a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabes branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabes branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering 
 i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a cudgel which i understood to be so denominated for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence then a new idea flashed across me i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabes branderham preach from the times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated 
 we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously 
 oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned hear all out finally he reached the first of the at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabes branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon 
 sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and is too much have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more 
 thou art the man cries jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy times seven did i take counsel with my this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints 
 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 chapter three 
 
 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right

 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert

 chapter 
 
 the dominant primordial beast 
 
 
 the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts 
 on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other 
 early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at yea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark 
 close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size 
 francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble he cried to buck give it to him by gar give it to him the dirty thief 
 spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil 
 an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured 
 in the meantime the astonished had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side 
 perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but is was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of charge then joined the flight out on the lake 
 later the nine gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at yea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs 
 ah my friends he said softly mebbe it make you mad dog those many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam what you think eh perrault 
 the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson 
 the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments 
 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled 
 in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity he seemed to remember it white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things 
 spitz was a practiced fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack 
 in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of spitz fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his guard then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes time and time again he tried for the throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him but instead shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away 
 spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited 
 but buck possessed a quality that made for he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg despite the pain and helplessness spitz struggled madly to keep up he saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten 
 there was no hope for him buck was inexorable mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes he maneuvered for the final rush the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks he could see them beyond spitz and to either side for the spring their eyes fixed upon him a pause seemed to fall every animal was motionless as though turned to stone only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death then buck sprang in and out but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder the dark circle became a dot on the moon flooded snow as spitz disappeared from view buck stood and looked on the successful champion the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good

 ext fire 
 in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at 
 her she can only go up 
 
 ext roof 
 on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over 
 the parapet leading the cops in pursuit 
 trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her 
 moverents so clean gliding in and out of each jump 
 contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops 
 agent brown however has the same unnatural grace 
 the metal scream of an el train is heard and trinity 
 turns to it racing for the back of the building 
 the edge falls away into a wide back alley the next 
 building is over feet away but face is 
 perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other 
 roof 
 the cops slow realizing they are about to see something 
 ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself 
 into the air 
 from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
 hangs in flight 
 then hitting somersaulting up still running hard 
 cop 
 motherfucker impossible 
 they stare as agent brown duplicates the 
 move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto 
 one knee 
 just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
 riveted steel the train screeches beneath her a 
 rattling blur of gray metal trinity junps landing 
 easily 
 she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air 
 barely reaching the last car 
 agent brown stands yanking out a gun 
 trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head 
 ahead she sees her only chance feet beyond the point 
 where the train has begun to turn there is 
 a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick 
 building 
 trinity zeroes in on it running as hard as she can her 
 speed compounded by the train the scream of the steel 
 rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the 
 turn 
 trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body 
 leveling into a dive she falls arms covering her head 
 as 
 the whole world seems to spin on its axis 
 and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down 
 stairs bleeding broken 
 but still alive 
 through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown 
 still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the 
 wind he touches his ear piece as the train 
 slides him past the window 
 trinity tries to move everything hurts 
 trinity 
 get up trinity fine 
 get up just get up 
 she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs 
 
 ext street 
 trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the 
 end of the block in a pool of white street light she 
 sees it 
 the telephone booth 
 obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk 
 focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone 
 begins to ring 
 across the street a garbage truck suddenly its 
 tires screaming as it accelerates 
 trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the 
 telephone booth as if taking aim 
 gritting through the pain she races the truck 
 slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly 
 bright bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as 
 she answers the phone 
 there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
 mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk 
 barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick 
 wall smashing it to plexiglas pulp 
 after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
 the garbage truck agent smith inspects the wreckage 
 there is no body trinity is gone 
 his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration 
 agent jones walks up behind him 
 agent smith 
 did you get anything from the room 
 agent jones 
 their next target the name is neo 
 the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground 
 separated in the crash like a severed limb 
 agent smith 
 need a search running 
 agent jones 
 already begun 
 we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer 
 and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
 like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall 
 through one 
 swallowed by the darkness that becomes 
 a computer screen 
 we are inside a chat room called the matrix 
 it is an exklusive where hackers hang out 
 screen 
 jackon i heard morpheus has been on this board 
 superastic morpheus even exist and the matrix is nothing but an advertising gimmick a new game 
 timaxe all i want to know is trinity really a girl

 uperastic no the matrix is the system controlling our lives 
 timaxe you mean mtv 
 superastic i mean sega 
 fos all hail sega 
 we drift back from the electric conversation entering 
 
 int apartment 
 it is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with 
 technology 
 cables coil everywhere into 
 thickets that wind up and around the legs of several 
 desks 
 tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay 
 open like an autopsied corpse 
 we turn towards the center of this of 
 technology following the slurping and crunching of 
 cereal we pass an open box of capln crunch as we find 
 neo a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
 computer than living outside one 
 neo 
 fuckin idiots know shit 
 he finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
 anonynous message slices onto the screen 
 screen 
 do you want to know what the matrix is neo 
 neo is frozen when he reads his name 
 screen 
 superastic who said that

 if you want to know follow the white rabbit 
 neo 
 what the hell 
 screen 
 timaxe someone is hacking the hackers 
 fos morpheus 
 jackon identify yourself 
 knock knock neo 
 a chill runs down his spine and when someone knocks on 
 his door he almost jumps out of his chair 
 he looks at the door then back at the computer but the 
 message is gone 
 he shakes his head not completely sure what happened 
 again someone knocks 
 cautiously neo approaches the door 
 voice 
 hey you in there 
 recognizing the voice he relaxes and opens it anthony 
 who lives down the hall is standing outside with a group 
 of friends 
 neo

 he holds up the red notice that accompanies the denver

lionfish nov chapter three the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the 
 
 mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george elder twin brothers 
 
 all right harry asked george 
 
 been going on said ron why you been answering my letters asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles 
 
 it me and how did he know 
 
 he works for the ministry said ron you know not supposed to do spells outside school 
 
 you should talk said harry staring at the floating car 
 
 oh this count said ron only borrowing this we enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with 
 
 i told you i but take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and let me come back and obviously i magic myself out because the think the second spell done in three days so 
 
 stop gibbering said ron come to take you home with us 
 
 but you magic me out either 
 
 we need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who got with me 
 
 tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry 
 
 if the dursleys wake up dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car 
 
 worry said fred and stand back 
 
 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough 
 
 at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window 
 
 uncle vernon coughed again 
 
 a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push 
 
 harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car 
 
 okay go george whispered 
 
 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice 
 
 that ruddy owl 
 
 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening 
 
 harry told them all about dobby the warning given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished 
 
 very fishy said fred finally 
 
 definitely dodgy agreed george so he even tell you supposed to be plotting all this stuff 
 
 i think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall 
 
 he saw fred and george look at each other 
 
 what you think he was lying to me said harry 
 
 well said fred put it this way have got powerful magic of their own but they usually use it without their permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you 
 
 yes said harry and ron together instantly 
 
 draco malfoy harry explained he hates me 
 
 draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius son 
 
 must be not a very common name is it said harry 
 
 heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of 
 
 and when disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in you inner circle 
 
 harry had heard these rumors about family before and they surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy 
 
 i know whether the malfoys own a said harry 
 
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and be rich said fred 
 
 yeah always wishing we had a to do the ironing said george but all got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden come with big old manors and castles and places like that you catch one in our house 
 
 harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously 
 
 glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you answer any of my letters i thought it was fault at first 
 
 errol 
 
 our owl ancient it be the first time collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes 
 
 who 
 
 the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front 
 
 but percy lend him to me said ron said he needed him 
 
 been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean only so many times you can polish a prefect badge driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel 
 
 so does your dad know got the car said harry guessing the answer 
 
 er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it 
 
 what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway 
 
 he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 
 the what 
 
 all to do with bewitching things that are you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks 
 
 what happened 
 
 the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up 
 
 but your dad this car 
 
 fred laughed yeah crazy about everything to do with muggles our full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad 
 
 the main road said george peering down through the windshield be there in ten minutes just as well getting light 
 
 a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east 
 
 fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees 
 
 a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole 
 
 lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees 
 
 touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at house 
 
 it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard 
 
 not much said ron 
 
 wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive 
 
 they got out of the car 
 
 now go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car 
 
 right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top 
 
 ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around 
 
 mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a tiger 
 
 ah said fred 
 
 oh dear said george 
 
 mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket 
 
 so she said 
 
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice 
 
 have you any idea how worried been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper 
 
 sorry mum but see we had to 
 
 all three of mrs sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them 
 
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy 
 
 perfect percy muttered fred 
 
 you could do with taking a leaf out of book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job 
 
 it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away 
 
 very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast 
 
 she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her 
 
 the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before 
 
 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the knight buscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart 
 
 but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives swooping down on him where he sat 
 
 harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent 
 
 what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them 
 
 he have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless 
 
 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus 
 
 you outta your tree yelped stan choo say is name for 
 
 sorry said harry hastily sorry i i forgot 
 
 forgot said stan weakly blimey my goin that fast 
 
 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically 
 
 yeah said stan still rubbing his chest yeah right very close to they sayanyway when little arry potter got the better of harry nervously flattened his bangs down again all supporters was tracked down they ern most of em knew it was all over wiv gone and they came quiet but not sirius black i eard he thought be once ad taken over 
 
 anyway they cornered black in the middle of a street full of muggles an black took out is wand and e blasted alf the street apart an a wizard got it an so did a dozen muggles what got in the way orrible eh an you know what black did then stan continued in a dramatic whisper 
 
 what said harry

 if he when he went to azkaban he will be now said ern in his slow voice blow meself up before i set foot in that place serves him right mind youafter what he did

 gas explosion grunted ernie 
 
 an now out said stan examining the newspaper picture of gaunt face again never been a breakout from azkaban before as there ern beats me ow e did it frightenin eh mind i fancy is chances against them azkaban guards eh ern 
 
 ernie suddenly shivered talk about summat else stan a good lad them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles 
 
 stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time 
 
 ear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus we ern e was tryin to run for it 
 
 he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry know anything about the wizard prison though everyone ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry soon forget the look of terror on face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew 
 
 the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go 
 
 finally harry was the only passenger left 
 
 right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london 
 
 diagon alley said harry 
 
 righto said stan old tight then 
 
 bang 
 
 they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he know 
 
 ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley 
 
 thanks harry said to ern 
 
 he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and cage onto the pavement 
 
 well said harry bye then 
 
 but stan paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 
 there you are harry said a voice 
 
 before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere 
 
 harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself 
 
 stan leapt onto the pavement beside them 
 
 what didja call neville minister he said excitedly 
 
 fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted 
 
 neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter 
 
 i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern arry potter i can see is scar 
 
 yes said fudge testily well very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now 
 
 fudge increased the pressure on shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord 
 
 got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy 
 
 perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still let go of harry 
 
 there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying trunk and cage and looking around excitedly 
 
 ow come you tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while owlish face peered interestedly over shoulder 
 
 and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly 
 
 bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar 
 
 bye neville called stan 
 
 fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room 
 
 sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire 
 
 harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his suit and sat down opposite harry 
 
 i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic 
 
 harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his invisibility cloak at the time fudge to know that 
 
 tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him 
 
 well harry said fudge pouring out tea had us all in a right flap i mind telling you running away from your aunt and house like that started to thinkbut safe and what matters 
 
 fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry 
 
 eat harry you look dead on your feet now thenyou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so that and no harm done 
 
 fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who believe his ears opened his mouth to speak think of anything to say and closed it again 
 
 ah worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays 
 
 harry unstuck his throat 
 
 i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i ever want to go back to privet drive 
 
 now now sure feel differently once calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and sure you are fond of each other er very deep down 
 
 it occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now 
 
 so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and 
 
 hang on blurted harry what about my punishment 
 
 fudge blinked punishment 
 
 i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry 
 
 oh my dear boy not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts 
 
 but this tally at all with past dealings with the ministry of magic 
 
 last year i got an official warning just because a smashed a pudding in my house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there 
 
 unless eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward 
 
 circumstances change harrywe have to take into accountin the present climatesurely you want to be expelled 
 
 of course i said harry 
 
 well then all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if got a room for you 
 
 fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what done and now harry came to think of it surely it usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic 
 
 fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper 
 
 room free harry said fudge i think be very comfortable just one thing and sure understandi want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and to be back here before dark each night sure understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me 
 
 okay said harry slowly but why 
 
 want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laugh no nobest we know where you arei mean 
 
 fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak 
 
 well be off plenty to do you know 
 
 have you had any luck with black yet harry asked 
 
 finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak 
 
 that oh heard well no not yet but only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failedand they are angrier than ever seen them 
 
 fudge shuddered slightly 
 
 so say 
 
 he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea 
 
 er minister can i ask you something 
 
 certainly said fudge with a smile 
 
 well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle sign the permission form think you could 
 
 fudge was looking uncomfortable 
 
 ah he said no no very sorry harry but as not your parent or guardian 
 
 but the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission 
 
 no sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly 
 
 perhaps be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think best if you be off enjoy your stay harry 
 
 and with a last smile and shake of hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry 
 
 if follow me mr potter he said already taken your things up 
 
 harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him 
 
 inside was a very bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe 
 
 hedwig harry gasped 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto arm 
 
 very smart owl got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if anything you need mr potter hesitate to ask 
 
 he gave another bow and left 
 
 harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that left privet drive only a few hours ago that he expelled and that he was now facing two completely weeks 
 
 been a very weird night hedwig he yawned 
 
 and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the invitationcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report a boisterous little boy but he hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully 
 
 however at the bottom of the report there were a few comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale 
 
 so after many tantrums after arguments that shook bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry 
 
 but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from house with a large box stuffed full of snacks parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry touched these he had had too much experience of cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint 
 
 uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter 
 
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia 
 
 aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes 
 
 uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon 
 
 the doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle grapefruit 
 
 harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall 
 
 aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked livid 
 
 you he barked at harry in the living room now 
 
 bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them 
 
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest so 
 
 harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled 
 
 this just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about you 
 
 confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postman 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud 
 
 dear mr and mrs dursley 
 we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron 
 as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports 
 i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a opportunity britain hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school 
 it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is 
 hoping to see harry soon 
 yours sincerely 
 molly weasley 
 i do hope put enough stamps on 
 uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else 
 
 look at this he growled 
 
 he held up the envelope in which mrs letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing 
 
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs was a mistake anyone could make his eyes flashed 
 
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funny 
 
 harry say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley 
 
 uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silence 
 
 so can i go then he asked 
 
 a slight spasm crossed uncle large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs letter again 
 
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste 
 
 seen her said harry my friend mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term 
 
 he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley household 
 
 uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant 
 
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hair 
 
 harry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall 
 
 uncle vernon was perusing the letter again 
 
 quidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbish 
 
 harry felt a second stab of annoyance 
 
 a sport he said shortly played on broom 
 
 all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answerin the normal way he scowled 
 
 what does she mean the normal way he spat 
 
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post normal for wizards 
 
 uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back 
 
 only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans 
 
 i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage 
 
 but harry going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he following diet and he going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i see the world cup can i go now then only got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfather 
 
 he had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
 
 writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear 
 
 well yeah said harry casually been a while since he heard from me and you know if he he might start thinking wrong 
 
 he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then 
 
 well all right then you can go to this ruddythis stupidthis world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys to pick you up mind i got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfathertell himtell him going 
 
 okay then said harry brightly 
 
 he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was goinghe was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup 
 
 outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on face 
 
 that was an excellent breakfast it said harry i feel really full you 
 
 laughing at the astonished look on face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom 
 
 the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once 
 
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled note 
 
 harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night writing to the muggles to ask you to stay they might already have the letter i know how fast muggle post is thought send this with pig anyway 
 harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig maybe he read writing he went back to the letter 
 
 coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon better if we pretend to ask their permission first if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and come and get you at five on sunday if they say no send pig back pronto and come and get you at five on sunday anyway 
 arriving this afternoon started work the department of international magical cooperation mention anything about abroad while here unless you want the pants bored off you 
 see you soon 
 ron 
 calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person come here i need you to take my answer back 
 
 the owl fluttered down on top of cage hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer 
 
 harry seized his quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote 
 
 ron all okay the muggles say i can come see you five tomorrow wait 
 harry 
 he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight 
 
 harry turned to hedwig 
 
 feeling up to a long journey he asked her 
 
 hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way 
 
 can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter hang oni just want to finish it 
 
 he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript 
 
 if you want to contact me be at my friend ron for the rest of the summer his got us tickets for the quidditch world cup 
 the letter finished he tied it to leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave 
 
 be at when you get back all right harry told her 
 
 she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window 
 
 harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort
