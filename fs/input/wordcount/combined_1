 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety

 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them

 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods

 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our cityto any other or bring back a false message from the city to whichhe is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends orenemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have neversaid let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and letthere be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted 
 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations

 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will

 of truth 
 what is truth said jesting pilate and would not stay for an answer certainly there be that delight in giddiness and count it a bondage to fix a belief affecting in thinking as well as in acting and though the sects of philosophers of that kind be gone yet there remain certain discoursing wits which are of the same veins though there be not so much blood in them as was in those of the ancients 
 but it is not only the difficulty and labour which men take in finding out of truth nor again mat when it is found it imposeth upon men s thoughts that doth bring lies in favour but a natural though corrupt love of the lie itself one of the later school of me grecians examineth the matter and is at a stand to think what should be in it mat men should love lies where neither they make for pleasure as with poets nor for advantage as with me merchant but for the sake but i cannot tell this same truth is a naked and open day light mat doth not show the masques and mummeries and triumphs of the world half so stately and daintily as candlelights truth may perhaps come to the price of a pearl that showeth best by day but it will not rise to me price of a diamond or carbuncle that showeth best in varied lights a mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure doth any man doubt mat if there were taken out of men s minds vain opinions nattering hopes false valuations imaginations as one would and the like but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things full of melancholy and indisposition and unpleasing to themselves one of the fathers in great severity called poesy vinum daenwnwn because it filleth the imagination and yet it is but with me shadow of a lie but it is not me lie that passeth through the mind but me lie mat sinketh in and settleth in it that doth me hurt such as we spake of before but howsoever these things arc thus in depraved judgements and affections yet truth which only doth judge itself teacheth that the inquiry of truth which is the or wooing of it the knowledge of truth which is the presence of it and the belief of truth which is the enjoying of it is the sovereign good of human nature 
 the first creature of god in the works of the days was the light of the sense 
 the last was the light of reason and his sabbath work ever since is the 
 illumination of his spirit first he breathed light upon the face of the matter or 
 chaos then he breathed light into the face of man and still he breatheth and 
 inspireth light into the face of his chosen the poet that beautified the sect 
 that was otherwise inferior to the rest saith yet excellently well it is a pleasure 
 to stand upon the shore and to see ships tossed upon the sea a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below but no pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth a hill not to be commanded and where the air is always clear and serene and to see the errors and wanderings and mists and tempests in the vale below so always that this prospect be with pity and not with swelling or pride certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a mind move in charity rest in providence and turn upon the poles of truth to pass from theological and philosophical truth to the truth of civil business it will be acknowledged even by those mat practise it not that clear and round dealing is the honour of nature and that mixture of falsehood is like allay in coin of gold and silver which may make the metal work the better but it embaseth it for these winding and crooked courses are the goings of the serpent which goeth basely upon the belly and not upon the feet there is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to be found false and perfidious and therefore mountaigny saith prettily when he enquired the reason why the word of the lie should be such a disgrace and such an odious charge saith he if it be well weighed to 
 lay that a man lieth is as much to say as mat he is brave towards god and a coward towards men for a lie faces god and shrinks from man surely the wickedness of falsehoods and breach of faith cannot possibly be so highly expressed as in mat it shall be the last peal to call the judgements of god upon the generations of men it being foretold that when christ cometh he shall not find faith upon the earth

 preface 
 
 so long as there shall exist by virtue of law and custom decrees of damnation pronounced by society artificially creating hells amid the civilization of earth and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny so long as the three great problems of the century the degradation of man through pauperism the corruption of woman through hunger the crippling of children through lack of light are unsolved so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the other words and with a still wider significance so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth books of the nature of les miserables cannot fail to be of use

 newsreel 
 paramount news brings you a special coverage of princess visit to london the first stop on her much publicised goodwill tour of european capitals she gets a royal welcome from the british as thousands cheer the gracious young member of one of oldest ruling families after three days of continuous activity and a visit to buckingham palace ann flew to amsterdam where her royal highness dedicated the new international aid building and christened an ocean liner then went to paris where she attended many official functions designed to cement trade relations between her country and the western european nations and so to rome the eternal city where the princess visit was marked by a spectacular military parade highlighted by the band of the crack piersa yeri regiment the smiling young princess showed no sign of the strain of the continuous public appearances and at her embassy that evening a formal reception and ball in her honor was given by her ambassador to italy 
 
 the embassy ballroom people fill the floor of the room a fanfare sounds the master of ceremonies appears and the people clear a path down the middle of the hall in front of him the master of ceremonies announces her royal in italian then in english 
 the orchestra starts playing as the master of ceremonies walks down the aisle princess ann resplendent in her ballgown diamond tiara and necklace appears at the door accompanied by the ambassador in formal military dress behind them follow together the countess vereberg and general provno and others as the company walks slowly down the aisle princess ann smiles and nods her head to acknowledge the guests who line their path they bow as the princess walks past them 
 as they reach the front the princess and the others step onto the dais as the orchestra finishes playing the dais is furnished with large one in the center the princess and the others stand facing the guests princess ann is about to sit when the ambassador discreetly stops her with a hand on her arm 
 as they stand waiting the guests form in a line in front the master of ceremonies announces them as they walk forward to greet her in turn

 ann 
 as the man bends gesturing with his hand in greeting 
 how do you do 
 as the last guest moves back ann looks around anxiously trying again to right her shoe resulting in her pushing it further away the ambassador then motions her to sit down as she sits back into the chair with the ambassador and the countess on either side her dress pulls back revealing the shoe 
 the orchestra starts playing a waltz ann tries as inconspicuously as possible to drag her shoe back with her foot the general standing behind her frowning motions to the countess to look at the shoe she looks down at it and closes her eyes in horror the princess stirs in her seat trying to get her shoe back fiddling with her gloves as cover a man standing behind the ambassador motions to him and he shrugs and gets up bowing and presenting his arm to the princess the princess rises and pausing for time to regather her shoe is lead onto the ballroom floor by the ambassador taking her up to dance he looks at the area in front of the eat and relieved that the shoe to be seen continues dancing with her as the other guests watch 
 later on and the dance floor is filled people princess ann dances with a short lively gentleman who rattles off rapid spanish phrases to her she listens nodding and smiling politely still later and she dances with a short elderly gentlemen they smile and nod to each other silently later again and ann dances with a somewhat remote gentlemen she almost speaks so as to strike up a conversation but thinks better of it

 a new hope 
 prologue 
 
 another galaxy another time 
 the old republic was the republic of legend greater than distance or need to note where it was or whence it came only to know thatit was therepublic 
 once under the wise rule of the senate and the protection of the jedi republic throve and grew but as often happens when wealth and power passbeyond the admirable and attain the awesome then appear those evil ones who havegreed to match

 book one 
 chapter i 
 
 well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes but i warn you if you tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news 
 it was in july and the speaker was the anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the elite 
 all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a footman that morning ran as follows 
 if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and annette scherer 
 heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa 
 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned 
 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope 
 and the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there 
 i thought fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 
 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 
 tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you know everything 
 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 
 prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct 
 in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out 
 oh speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 
 she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 
 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea 
 in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard 
 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature 
 prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron 
 anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with 
 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 
 as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and again her face clouded over with sadness 
 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 chapter 
 
 
 
 i have just returned from a visit to my solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society a perfect heaven and mr heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as i announced my name 
 mr heathcliff i said 
 a nod was the answer 
 mr lockwood your new tenant sir i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts 
 thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow anyone to inconvenience me if i could hinder in 
 the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself 
 when he saw my breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr horse and bring up some wine 
 here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order 
 no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only 
 joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent 
 wuthering heights is the name of mr dwelling wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones 
 before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date and the name hareton earnshaw i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium 
 one step brought us into the family without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof the latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses 
 the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner but mr heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living he is a gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of manifestations of mutual kindliness love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again no running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him mr heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a acquaintance to those which actuate me let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one 
 while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a sweetest of all imaginable looks and what did i do i confess it with icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate 
 i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl 
 better let the dog alone growled mr heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot not accustomed to be kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph 
 joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in peace 
 mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with gown bare arms and cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene 
 what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment 
 what the devil indeed i muttered the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers 
 they meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table the dogs do right to be vigilant take a glass of wine 
 no thank you 
 not bitten are you 
 if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter 
 countenance relaxed into a grin 
 come come he said you are flurried mr lockwood here take a little wine guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them your health sir 
 i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion i shall go notwithstanding it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him

 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo 
 i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time 
 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world 
 well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby 
 while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded 
 as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face got a treat for you after supper 
 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father 
 yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there 
 hurry and get done stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat 
 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home 
 give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but truly try to be better so he be disappointed in me 
 we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but any more if i can help it 
 try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south 
 beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home 
 mrs march broke the silence that followed words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city 
 what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the were said jo 
 i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg 
 i remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i too old for such things rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve 
 we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another out burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home 
 really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady 
 each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she got any said her mother 
 yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people 
 bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much 
 let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good hard work and we forget and do our best 
 we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty 
 look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march 
 they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them 
 at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and herr mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp 
 crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby

 mistress no other man was allowed 
 to touch her 
 she makes her way through the ornate statuary the camera comes to a stop 
 on a cracked stone face a beat and then eyes suddenly pop open 
 really a strange looking tattooed man several more of these hideous bald 
 men stand nearby they are the priests of osiris guys their 
 eyes watch vanish through the bedroom curtains 
 embraces imhotep they kiss passionately feverishly hands roam 
 over her perfect body smearing the paint the voice fills with 
 lust 
 narrator 
 but for our love we were willing to 
 risk life itself 
 and we realize that the narrator is actually imhotep himself 
 on the of the curtains the bald priests rush over and close the 
 doors but just as they do the doors suddenly burst open pharaoh angrily 
 strides in looks at the priests the following dialogue is in ancient 
 egyptian subtitled

 behind him lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back 
 pharaoh screams imhotep raises sword the hideous bald priests 
 slam the doors and bolt them tight through the curtains they see the 
 shadows of and imhotep stab away at pharaoh suddenly the 
 doors are rammed from the other side wham imhotep and 
 turn and look wham the doors are rammed again the two lovers share 
 desperate looks wham the bald priests run up and grab imhotep and try 
 and pull him towards the balcony 
 priests 
 bodyguards 
 imhotep tries to break free but rips sword out of 
 his hand and pushes him towards the balcony

 only you can resurrect me 
 face fills with despair the doors explode open men with 
 skin and strange over their bodies stride in 
 armed to the teeth these are the mumia the priests hustle imhotep out 
 onto the dark balcony just as the mumia rip through the curtains 
 points at pharaoh and hisses 
 
 my body is no longer his temple 
 she plunges the sword into her own heart out on the balcony 
 mouth opens into a horrible silent scream 
 
 for murdering pharaoh body 
 was to be cursed and it was i the high 
 priest whose duty it was to curse it 
 ext sand dunes night 
 imhotep procession across the dunes 
 mummy is carried by nubian slaves they pet her down in the sand along with 
 five jewel encrusted jars 
 imhotep 
 her body was mummified her vital 
 organs removed and placed in sacred canopic 
 jars 
 imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of pure gold this 
 is the book of the living 
 imhotep 
 the book of the living contained 
 sacred incantations that would send the evil 
 dead on a journey into the dark underworld 
 strange light suddenly flashes across body and across the 
 faces of the slaves and the egyptian soldiers suddenly 
 eyes all rise as if watching body rising then 
 one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and over 
 body now lies twisted on the ground 
 priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus the nubian 
 slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand imhotep then signals to 
 the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians killing them 
 inhotep 
 
 the slaves were killed 
 priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking 
 at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly 
 watches 
 imhotep 
 and the soldiers who killed them 
 were also slain so that no unholy person 
 should ever know the exact location of the 
 burial site 
 the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one 
 the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
 vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
 dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto 
 grave and begin digging it back up with their hands 
 ext sahara desert night 
 chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the way a 
 hearse carries mummy the map of ancient egypt fades up 
 the chariots race across the map 
 imhotep 
 but there was another book the book 
 of the dead which was never opened 
 never to be read for it contained the 
 incantations that could bring a dead body 
 back to life a most unholy thing 
 the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic they race up 
 the stone ramp and in through the city gates superimposed across the 
 screen are the words 
 kanunaptm city of the dead 
 imhotep 
 it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
 the dead inside the statue of anubis so 
 that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace 
 egypt 
 ext hamunaptra anubis site night 
 imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant 
 statue of anubis he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead 
 made of black stone 
 imhotep 
 but for my love of i 
 was willing to defy the gods 
 int underground necropolis night 
 big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of 
 this very large scary underground cemetery a detritus moat surrounds the 
 cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains skulls bob in 
 the goop the priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
 eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and forth as they 
 chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures in the middle of the circle is 
 a strange twisted altar imhotep has unwrapped gorgeous 
 lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her 
 imhotep 
 vital organs were 
 still fresh so a human sacrifice would not 
 need be made 
 as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole 
 starts to open in the detritus bog several priests look over at it 
 frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting a strange mist 
 wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through 
 them and into body one of the jars shudders the heart 
 inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist 
 beating heart and readings are reaching a crescendo 
 eyes suddenly fly open 
 imhotep 
 soul had come back from 
 the dead now all that was needed was to 
 return her organs to their rightful place 
 within her body 
 imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above breast about to 
 plunge it down the chanting swirling and beating heart climax and 
 when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests the head 
 mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks back 
 out of body and implodes back into the swirling hole 
 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals 
 a head is wedged between two strong boards his eyes widen in 
 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but 
 just before he does we quickly cut to face horrified as off 
 camera the priest screams 
 we go wide on the chamber all of priests squirm 
 inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees his arms are held 
 back his mouth is pried open 
 imhotep 
 as for me i was condemned to endure 
 the the worst of all ancient curses 
 one so horrible it had never before been 
 bestowed 
 using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls tongue out of his 
 mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it tight on 
 eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out the embalmer flings 
 tongue onto the floor the dogs attack and quickly eat 
 it 
 imhotep is wrapped al m only his mouth nostrils and eyes are 
 left free of the slimy bandages detritus muck boils inside a black 
 cauldron embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to 
 wrappings as he squirms then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone 
 sarcophagus an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin 
 wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the bucket over 
 chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles they scurry 
 across screaming face some vanish into his mouth 
 and up his nostrils 
 inhotep 
 by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
 be cursed to stay alive forever and by 
 eating me they were cursed just the same 
 the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
 ycey the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight the heavy sarcophagus lid 
 is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight once 
 again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid 
 tight 
 imhotep 
 i was to remain sealed inside my 
 sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity 
 the strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of 
 the key turning it into a little puzzle box 
 inhotep 
 they would never allow me to be 
 released for i would arise a walking 
 disease a plague upon mankind an unholy 
 with the strength of ages power 
 over the sands and the glory of 
 invincibility 
 sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the disgusting muck 
 splashes up drools down sides and then is mysteriously sucked into 
 seams vanishing clean 
 inhotep 
 and if i could raise my beloved 
 from her place in hell 
 together we would be an unstoppable 
 infection upon this world the apocalypse 
 the end 
 horrifying screans can be heard coming from inside 
 his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it the main title is 
 superimposed on the scream the mummy 
 the heavily armed mumia stand guard around grave looking down on 
 the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the god of 
 death it stares at us then begins to decay before bur very eyes aging 
 years in only seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit 
 statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert 
 ext sahara hamanaptra ruins day 
 horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg horseman 
 racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren armed 
 to the teeth superimposed across the screen are the words tee sarkra 
 
 a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires 
 scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught our hero is up on 
 the wall his kepi sits at a jaunty angle dashing and handsome this is 
 rick he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at 
 him 
 
 i knew this was gonna be a lousy day 
 a doughy little frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of 
 the wall this is beni 
 beni 
 personally i would like to surrender 
 why can we not just surrender 
 
 and gimme your bandolier 
 beni pulls off his cartridge belt hands it to 
 beni 
 then run away right now while we 
 can still make it 
 throws it on crisscrossing his own bandolier 
 
 now gimme your revolver 
 never use it anyway 
 beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to 
 beni 
 then play dead huh nobody ever 
 does that anymore 
 slides it into his belt next to his own revolver 
 
 now go find me a big stick 
 beni 
 in the desert what for 
 turns and goes with him 
 
 so i can tie it to your back you 
 appear to be without a spine 
 the horde of warriors thunders forward now a half mile out scimitars 
 rattling and beni run through the ruins 
 
 a guy like you end up in the 
 legion anyways 
 beni 
 i got caught robbing a synagogue lots 
 of good stuff in them holy places churches 
 temples mosques and guarding them 
 
 altar boys 
 beni 
 exactly i speak seven languages 
 including hebrew so my specialty was 
 synagogues how about you kill somebody 
 beni trips and accidentally tackles to the ground 
 gives him a nasty look 
 
 no but considering it 
 they get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp 
 beni 
 what then robbery extortion 
 kidnapping 
 
 none of the above thank you 
 beni 
 then what the hell are you 
 doing here 
 they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of 
 sound of charging horses is deafening gives beni a 
 big cheesy smile 
 
 i was just looking for a good time 
 and when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and 
 runs instantly stiffens 
 
 oh shit steady 
 gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding 
 the sand several more legionnaires take off 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i sayin 
 the tuaregs let loose with those horrifying screams more 
 legionnaires beni is one of them 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i doin 
 the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim steels himself cocks 
 and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the 
 sand another beat and then 
 
 fire 
 the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with a crash the 
 blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts the prone 
 legionnaires quickly begin to reload 
 
 fire 
 the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand the remaining 
 warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the hot air a third of the 
 legionnaires are killed instantly 
 
 fire 
 the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off their mounts 
 crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins 
 and through the legionnaires grabs the barrel of his rifle and 
 starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed 
 beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in 
 full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him he crawls through 
 the front gate 
 throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he gun 
 in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts 
 beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the 
 rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires 
 are shot off their feet behind him guns go empty 
 
 
 he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate four tuareg 
 warriors on massive arabians after him hurdles a stone 
 column hits the ground running he spots beni inside the temple doorway 
 trying to close the heavy sandstone door 
 
 hey beni wait up 
 beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder 
 
 what are ya doing wait up 
 runs faster beni pushes harder the four horsemen leap the big 
 column and charge after him hoofs pounding 
 
 you close that door 
 you close trat door 
 beni closes the door just as reaches it slams his body 
 into the door it budge 
 
 gonna get you for this 
 he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his life weaving 
 through the ruins the arabians getting closer and closer the pounding 
 hoofs getting louder and louder finally spins around and faces 
 his attackers the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him 
 the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off just 
 stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird 
 and when the horses go all four of them rear up two of 
 the riders are thrown to the ground the horses screech and bellow and 
 snort in fear then buck like fury and away as if the devil 
 himself had scared them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
 mounts 
 just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and 
 checks out his middle finger and then he feels the evil himself and turns 
 around the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him 
 suddenly the sand begins to shift under feet he starts to 
 back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge 
 snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes 
 drawing a picture quickly turns and runs off through the 
 ruins the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand 
 is a picture of screaming face

 the orchestra starts playing a waltz ann tries as inconspicuously as possible to drag her shoe back with her foot the general standing behind her frowning motions to the countess to look at the shoe she looks down at it and closes her eyes in horror the princess stirs in her seat trying to get her shoe back fiddling with her gloves as cover a man standing behind the ambassador motions to him and he shrugs and gets up bowing and presenting his arm to the princess the princess rises and pausing for time to regather her shoe is lead onto the ballroom floor by the ambassador taking her up to dance he looks at the area in front of the eat and relieved that the shoe to be seen continues dancing with her as the other guests watch

 flying high above an upper middle class suburb the wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the homes are traditional and coming closer to the ground we pick out a couple of male jogger 
 a different angle on the joggers at level now moving alongside them both in their thirties athletic blandly handsome they pass a street sign that reads robin hood trail 
 suddenly a man comes into view flying aboutthree feet above their heads wearing pajamas and a plaid flannel robe as he passes overhead the joggers look up and wave excitedly like children he flashes them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them behind 
 as the man flies down the street a barking dog runs alongbeneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him the man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto porches or as close as he can get seeing the flying man the boy tosses a paper high into the air the dog tears off to catch the paper the flying man laughs and shoots upward like been blown out of a cannon grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the front porch of a house with distinctive cedar shingle siding and a red front door 
 the boy on the bike watches in admiration the man slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair the dog barks the boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even higher than before and the man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it this is going to be fun and we smash cut to

 chapter 
 
 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops 
 but buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog the whole realm was his he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the sons he escorted mollie and alice the daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles on wintry nights he lay at the feet before the roaring library fire he carried the grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches among the terriers he stalked imperiously and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored for he was over all creeping crawling flying things of judge place humans included 
 his father elmo a huge st bernard had been the inseparable companion and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father he was not so weighed only one hundred and forty his mother she had been a scotch shepherd dog nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat he had a fine pride in himself was even a trifle egotistical as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles and to him as to the races the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver 
 and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of when the klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north but buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that manuel one of the helpers was an undesirable acquaintance manuel had one besetting sin he loved to play chinese lottery also in his gambling he had one besetting in a system and this made his damnation certain for to play a system requires money while the wages of a helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny 
 the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of treachery no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard on what buck imagined was merely a stroll and with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as college park this man talked with manuel and money chinked between them 
 you might wrap up the goods before you deliver them the stranger said gruffly and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around neck under the collar 
 twist it and choke him plenty said manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative 
 buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity to be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own but when the ends of the rope were placed in the hands he growled menacingly he had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command but to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath in a quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back then the rope tightened mercilessly while buck struggled in a fury his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry but his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car 
 the next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance the hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was he had traveled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car he opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnaped king the man sprang for his throat but buck was too quick for him his jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more 
 yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle taking him up for the boss to frisco a crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure him 
 concerning that ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water front 
 all i get is fifty for it he grumbled and i do it over for a thousand cold cash 
 his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle 
 how much did the other mug get the demanded 
 a hundred was the reply take a sou less so help me 
 that makes a hundred and fifty the calculated and worth it or a squarehead 
 the kidnaper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand if i get hydrophobia 
 be because you was born to hang laughed the here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added 
 dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him buck attempted to face his tormentors but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck then the rope was removed and he was flung into a crate 
 there he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate he did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the judge or the boys at least but each time it was the bulging face of the that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle and each time the joyful bark that trembled in throat was twisted into a savage growl 
 but the let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate more tormentors buck decided for they were creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars they only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands clerks in the express office took charge of him he was carted about in another wagon a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car 
 for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him when he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him they growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed he did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to for that matter and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue 
 he was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck that had given them an unfair advantage but now that it was off he would show them they would never get another rope around his neck upon that he was resolved for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him his eyes turned bloodshot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle 
 four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small back yard a stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver that was the man buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club 
 you going to take him out now the driver asked 
 sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry 
 there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance 
 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater 
 answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all will go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog and whale the stuffing outa you understand 
 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand 
 he was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club he had learned the lesson and in all his afterlife he never forgot it that club was a revelation it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused as the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated of this last buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery 
 now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them buck wondered where they went for they never came back but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected 
 yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand 
 sacredam he cried when his eyes lit upon buck dat one dam bully dog eh how much 
 three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater and seeing government money you got no kick coming eh perrault 
 perrault grinned considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal the canadian government would be no loser nor would its dispatches travel the slower perrault knew dogs when he looked at buck he knew that he was one in a in ten thousand he commented mentally 
 buck saw money pass between them and was not surprised when curly a newfoundland and he were led away by the little weazened man that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater and as curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal it was the last he saw of the warm southland curly and he were taken below by perrault and turned over to a giant called francois perrault was a french canadian and swarthy but francois was a french canadian and twice as swarthy they were a new kind of men to buck of which he was destined to see many more and while he developed no affection for them he none the less grew honestly to respect them he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair men calm and impartial in administering justice and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs 
 in the of the narwhal buck and curly joined two other dogs one of them was a big fellow from spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain and who had later accompanied a geological survey into the barrens 
 he was friendly in a treacherous sort of way smiling into face the while he meditated some underhand trick as for instance when he stole from food at the first meal as buck sprang to punish him the lash of whip sang through the air reaching the culprit first and nothing remained to buck but to recover the bone that was fair of francois he decided and the began his rise in estimation 
 the other dog made no advances nor received any also he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers he was a gloomy morose fellow ant he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone and further that there would be trouble if he were not left alone dave he was called and he ate and slept or yawned between times and took interest in nothing not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed when buck and curly grew excited with fear he raised his head as though annoyed favored them with an incurious glance yawned and went to sleep again 
 day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller and though one day was very like another it was apparent to buck that the weather was steadily growing colder at last one morning the propeller was quiet and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement he felt it as did the other dogs and knew that a change was at hand francois leashed them and brought them on deck at the first step upon the cold surface feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud he sprang back with a snort more of this white stuff was falling through the air he shook himself but more of it fell upon him he sniffed it curiously then licked some up on his tongue it bit like fire and the next instant was gone this puzzled him he tried it again with the same results the onlookers laughed uproariously and he felt ashamed he knew not why for it was his first snow

 a dark empty room 
 the door bursts open a man and woman enter drunk and giggling horny as hell no sooner is the door shut than all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouths locked together 
 he gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over instead hell with it got more urgent things to do like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts she arches moaning fumbling with his fly he slams her against the wall ripping her skirt we hear fabric tear 
 he enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall she cries out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensations running through her he carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him they fall onto the bed 
 camera pulls back exiting through the window traveling smoothly outside 
 ext cabin night 
 to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the lovers cries spilling into the night 
 and we drift down a wooded path the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls 
 and we begin to hear faint music in the woods tinny and incongruous and still we keep pulling back until 
 a car is revealed a plymouth parked in a clearing 
 int plymouth night 
 andy dufresne wire rim glasses suit under normal circumstances a respectable solid citizen hardly dangerous perhaps even meek but these circumstances are far from normal he is disheveled unshaven and very drunk a cigarette smolders in his mouth his eyes flinty and hard are riveted to the bungalow up the path 
 he can hear them fucking from here 
 he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back the radio 
 plays softly painfully romantic taunting him 
 you stepped out of a dream you are too wonderful to be what you seem 
 he opens the glove compartment pulls out an object wrapped in a rag he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully 
 revealing a revolver oily black evil 
 he grabs a box of bullets spills them everywhere all over the seats and floor clumsy he picks bullets off his lap loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim six in the chamber his gaze goes back to the bungalow 
 he shuts off the radio abrupt silence except for the distant lovers moans he takes another shot of bourbon courage then opens the door and steps from the car 
 ext plymouth night 
 his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel loose bullets scatter to the ground the bourbon bottle drops and shatters 
 he starts up the path unsteady on his feet the closer he gets the louder the lovemaking becomes louder and more frenzied the lovers are reaching a climax their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts 
 woman 
 oh god 
 andy lurches to a stop listening the woman cries out in 
 orgasm the sound slams into brain like an icepick he 
 shuts his eyes tightly wishing the sound would stop 
 it finally does dying away like a siren until all left 
 is the shallow gasping and panting of we hear 
 languorous laughter moans of satisfaction 
 woman 
 oh sooo the best i ever had 
 andy just stands and listens devastated he look like much of a killer now just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods tears streaming down his face a loaded gun held loosely at his side a pathetic figure really

 you as a fantastic coincidence mr dufresne or is it just me

 you recall lt testimony 
 he and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was

 i suspect mr answer to that would be yes i further

 he picks up a revolver spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune 
 
 a revolver holds six bullets not eight i submit to you this was not 
 a crime of passion that could at least be understood 
 if not condoned no this was revenge of a much more brutal and 
 nature consider four bullets per victim not six shots

 the republic 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 the introduction 
 
 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument 
 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 book ii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book iii 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon
