lionfish nov chapter the centaur and the sneakcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 bet you wish you given up divination now you hermione asked parvati smirking 
 
 it was breakfast time two days after the sacking of professor trelawney and parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon they were to have their first lesson with firenze that morning 
 
 not really said hermione indifferently who was reading the daily never really liked horses 
 
 she turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns 
 
 not a horse a centaur said lavender sounding shocked 
 
 a gorgeous centaur sighed parvati 
 
 either way still got four legs said hermione coolly anyway i thought you two were all upset that trelawney had gone 
 
 we are lavender assured her we went up to her office to see her we took her some daffodils not the honking ones that got nice ones 
 
 how is she asked harry 
 
 not very good poor thing said lavender sympathetically she was crying and saying rather leave the castle for ever than stay here where umbridge is and i blame her umbridge was horrible to her she 
 
 got a feeling umbridge has only just started being horrible said hermione darkly 
 
 impossible said ron who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon she get any worse than been already 
 
 you mark my words going to want revenge on dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her said hermione closing the newspaper especially another you saw the look on her face when she saw firenze 
 
 after breakfast hermione departed for her arithmancy class as harry and ron followed parvati and lavender into the entrance hall heading for divination 
 
 we going up to north tower asked ron looking puzzled as parvati bypassed the marble staircase 
 
 parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder 
 
 how expect firenze to climb that ladder in classroom eleven now it was on the noticeboard yesterday 
 
 classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the entrance hall from the opposite side to the great hall harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom when he entered it right behind ron and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing he was therefore momentarily stunned 
 
 what the 
 
 the classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft dappled green light the students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests and all looking rather nervous in the middle of the clearing where there were no trees stood firenze 
 
 harry potter he said holding out a hand when harry entered 
 
 erhi said harry shaking hands with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile ergood to see you 
 
 and you said the centaur inclining his head it was foretold that we would meet again 
 
 harry noticed there was the shadow of a bruise on chest as he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground he saw they were all looking at him in awe apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating 
 
 when the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket firenze gestured around the room 
 
 professor dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us said firenze when everyone had settled down in imitation of my natural habitat i would have preferred to teach you in the forbidden forest which wasuntil mondaymy home but that is no longer possible 
 
 pleaseer sir said parvati breathlessly raising her not been in there with hagrid not frightened 
 
 it is not a question of your bravery said firenze but of my position i cannot return to the forest my herd has banished me 
 
 herd said lavender in a confused voice and harry knew she was thinking of cows what oh 
 
 comprehension dawned on her face there are more of you she said stunned 
 
 did hagrid breed you like the thestrals asked dean eagerly 
 
 firenze turned his head very slowly to face dean who seemed to realise at once that he had said something very offensive 
 
 i meantsorry he finished in a hushed voice 
 
 centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans said firenze quietly there was a pause then parvati raised her hand again 
 
 please sir why have the other centaurs banished you 
 
 because i have agreed to work for professor dumbledore said firenze they see this as a betrayal of our kind 
 
 harry remembered how nearly four years ago the centaur bane had shouted at firenze for allowing harry to ride to safety on his back he had called him a common mule he wondered whether it had been bane who had kicked firenze in the chest 
 
 let us begin said firenze he swished his long palomino tail raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly and as he did so the light in the room dimmed so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight and stars appeared on the ceiling there were oohs and gasps and ron said audibly blimey 
 
 lie back on the floor said firenze in his calm voice and observe the heavens here is written for those who can see the fortune of our races 
 
 harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling a twinkling red star winked at him from overhead 
 
 i know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in astronomy said calm voice and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us 
 
 professor trelawney did astrology with us said parvati excitedly raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back mars causes accidents and burns and things like that and when it makes an angle to saturn like now she drew a in the air above her that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things 
 
 that said firenze calmly is human nonsense 
 
 hand fell limply to her side 
 
 trivial hurts tiny human accidents said firenze as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor these are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe and are unaffected by planetary movements 
 
 professor trelawney began parvati in a hurt and indignant voice 
 
 is a human said firenze simply and is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind 
 
 harry turned his head very slightly to look at parvati she looked very offended as did several of the people surrounding her 
 
 sybill trelawney may have seen i do not know continued firenze and harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them but she wastes her time in the main on the nonsense humans call i however am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs which is impersonal and impartial we watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there it may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing 
 
 firenze pointed to the red star directly above harry 
 
 in the past decade the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars mars bringer of battle shines brightly above us suggesting that the fight must soon break out again how soon centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves by the observation of fume and flame 
 
 it was the most unusual lesson harry had ever attended they did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor and firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this that it took centaurs years and years to become competent and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly he was nothing like any human teacher harry had ever had his priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew but rather to impress upon them that nothing not even centaurs knowledge was foolproof 
 
 not very definite on anything is he said ron in a low voice as they put out their mallowsweet fire i mean i could do with a few more details about this war about to have you 
 
 the bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle and quite convinced that he was really in the forest the class filed out looking slightly perplexed 
 
 harry and ron were on the point of following them when firenze called harry potter a word please 
 
 harry turned the centaur advanced a little towards him ron hesitated 
 
 you may stay firenze told him but close the door please 
 
 ron hastened to obey 
 
 harry potter you are a friend of are you not said the centaur 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 then give him a warning from me his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon it 
 
 his attempt is not working harry repeated blankly 
 
 and he would do better to abandon it said firenze nodding i would warn hagrid myself but i am banishedit would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now hagrid has troubles enough without a centaurs battle 
 
 hagrid attempting to do said harry nervously 
 
 firenze surveyed harry impassively 
 
 hagrid has recently rendered me a great service said firenze and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures i shall not betray his secret but he must be brought to his senses the attempt is not working tell him harry potter to you 
 
 the happiness harry had felt in the aftermath of the quibbler interview had long since evaporated as a dull march blurred into a squally april his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again 
 
 umbridge had continued attending all care of magical creatures lessons so it had been very difficult to deliver warning to hagrid at last harry had managed it by pretending lost his copy of fantastic beasts and where to find them and doubling back after class one day when repeated words hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy blackened eyes apparently taken aback then he seemed to pull himself together 
 
 nice bloke firenze he said gruffly but he don know what talkin abou on this the comin on fine 
 
 hagrid you up to asked harry seriously because got to be careful umbridge has already sacked trelawney and if you ask me on a roll if doing anything you be be 
 
 things more importan than keepin a job said hagrid though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor don worry abou me harry jus get along now a good lad 
 
 harry had no choice but to leave hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle 
 
 meanwhile as the teachers and hermione persisted in reminding them the owls were drawing ever nearer all the were suffering from stress to some degree but hannah abbott became the first to receive a calming draught from madam pomfrey after she burst into tears during herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now 
 
 if it had not been for the da lessons harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy he sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the room of requirement working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow da members and saw how far they had come indeed harry sometimes wondered how umbridge was going to react when all the members of the da received outstanding in their defence against the dark arts owls 
 
 they had finally started work on patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practise though as harry kept reminding them producing a patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a dementor 
 
 oh be such a killjoy said cho brightly watching her silvery patronus soar around the room of requirement during their last lesson before easter so pretty 
 
 not supposed to be pretty supposed to protect you said harry patiently what we really need is a boggart or something how i learned i had to conjure a patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor 
 
 but that would be really scary said lavender who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand and i it she added angrily 
 
 neville was having trouble too his face was screwed up in concentration but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip 
 
 got to think of something happy harry reminded him 
 
 trying said neville miserably who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat 
 
 harry i think doing it yelled seamus who had been brought along to his first ever da meeting by dean gone but it was definitely something hairy harry 
 
 patronus a shining silver otter was gambolling around her 
 
 they are sort of nice they she said looking at it fondly 
 
 the door of the room of requirement opened and closed harry looked round to see who had entered but there did not seem to be anybody there it was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent next thing he knew something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee he looked down and saw to his very great astonishment dobby the peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats 
 
 hi dobby he said what are wrong 
 
 the eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking the members of the da closest to harry had fallen silent everybody in the room was watching dobby the few patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist leaving the room looking much darker than before 
 
 harry potter sir squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot harry potter sir dobby has come to warn you but the have been warned not to tell 
 
 he ran at the wall harry who had some experience of dobby s habits of made to seize him but dobby merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hats hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy 
 
 happened dobby harry asked grabbing the tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself 
 
 harry potter she she 
 
 dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist harry seized that too 
 
 she dobby 
 
 but he thought he knew surely only one she could induce such fear in dobby the elf looked up at him slightly and mouthed wordlessly 
 
 umbridge asked harry horrified 
 
 dobby nodded then tried to bang his head on knees harry held him at length 
 
 what about her dobbyshe found out about thisabout usabout the da 
 
 he read the answer in the stricken face his hands held fast by harry the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor 
 
 is she coming harry asked quietly 
 
 dobby let out a howl and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor 
 
 yes harry potter yes 
 
 harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf 
 
 what are you waiting for harry bellowed run 
 
 they all pelted towards the exit at once forming a scrum at the door then people burst through harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories it was only ten to nine if they just took refuge in the library or the owlery which were both nearer 
 
 harry come on shrieked hermione from the centre of the knot of people now fighting to get out 
 
 he scooped up dobby who was still attempting to do himself serious injury and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue 
 
 dobbythis is an orderget back down to the kitchen with the other elves and if she asks you whether you warned me lie and say no said harry and i forbid you to hurt yourself he added dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him 
 
 thank you harry potter squeaked dobby and he streaked off harry glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished he started to run right there was a boys bathroom up ahead he could pretend been in there all the time if he could just reach it 
 
 aaargh 
 
 something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt someone behind him was laughing he rolled over on to his back and saw malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly vase 
 
 trip jinx potter he said hey professorprofessor got one 
 
 umbridge came bustling round the far corner breathless but wearing a delighted smile 
 
 him she said jubilantly at the sight of harry on the floor excellent draco excellent oh very goodfifty points to slytherin take him from here stand up potter 
 
 harry got to his feet glaring at the pair of them he had never seen umbridge looking so happy she seized his arm in a grip and turned beaming broadly to malfoy 
 
 you hop along and see if you can round up any more of them draco she said tell the others to look in the libraryanybody out of breathcheck the bathrooms miss parkinson can do the girls onesoff you goand you she added in her softest most dangerous voice as malfoy walked away you can come with me to the office potter 
 
 they were at the stone gargoyle within minutes harry wondered how many of the others had been caught he thought of ronmrs weasley would kill himand of how hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her owls and it had been very first meeting and neville had been getting so good 
 
 fizzing whizzbee sang umbridge the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker but umbridge did not bother to knock she strode straight inside still holding tight to harry 
 
 the office was full of people dumbledore was sitting behind his desk his expression serene the tips of his long fingers together professor mcgonagall stood rigidly beside him her face extremely tense cornelius fudge minister for magic was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire apparently immensely pleased with the situation kingsley shacklebolt and a wizard with very short wiry hair whom harry did not recognise were positioned either side of the door like guards and the freckled bespectacled form of percy weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands apparently poised to take notes 
 
 the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight all of them were alert and serious watching what was happening below them as harry entered a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their ear 
 
 harry pulled himself free of grasp as the door swung shut behind them cornelius fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face 
 
 well he said well well well 
 
 harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster his heart drummed madly inside him but his brain was oddly cool and clear 
 
 he was heading back to gryffindor tower said umbridge there was an indecent excitement in her voice the same callous pleasure harry had heard as she watched professor trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall the malfoy boy cornered him 
 
 did he did he said fudge appreciatively i must remember to tell lucius well potter i expect you know why you are here 
 
 harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes his mouth had opened and the word was when he caught sight of face dumbledore was not looking directly at harryhis eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulderbut as harry stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side 
 
 harry changed direction 
 
 yeno 
 
 i beg your pardon said fudge 
 
 no said harry firmly 
 
 you know why you are here 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 fudge looked incredulously from harry to professor umbridge harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at dumbledore who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink 
 
 so you have no idea said fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm why professor umbridge has brought you to this office you are not aware that you have broken any school rules 
 
 school rules said harry no 
 
 or ministry decrees amended fudge angrily 
 
 not that aware of said harry blandly 
 
 his heart was still hammering very fast it was almost worth telling these lies to watch fudges blood pressure rising but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them if somebody had tipped off umbridge about the da then he the leader might as well be packing his trunk right now 
 
 so news to you is it said fudge his voice now thick with anger that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school 
 
 yes it is said harry hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face 
 
 i think minister said umbridge silkily from beside him we might make better progress if i fetch our informant 
 
 yes yes do said fudge nodding and he glanced maliciously at dumbledore as umbridge left the room nothing like a good witness is there dumbledore 
 
 nothing at all cornelius said dumbledore gravely inclining his head 
 
 there was a wait of several minutes in which nobody looked at each other then harry heard the door open behind him umbridge moved past him into the room gripping by the shoulder friend marietta who was hiding her face in her hands 
 
 be scared dear be frightened said professor umbridge softly patting her on the back quite all right now you have done the right thing the minister is very pleased with you be telling your mother what a good girl been mother minister she added looking up at fudge is madam edgecombe from the department of magical transportation floo network office been helping us police the fires you know 
 
 jolly good jolly good said fudge heartily like mother like daughter eh well come on now dear look up be shy hear what got togalloping gargoyles 
 
 as marietta raised her head fudge leapt backwards in shock nearly landing himself in the fire he cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word sneak 
 
 never mind the spots now dear said umbridge impatiently just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the minister 
 
 but marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically 
 
 oh very well you silly girl tell him snapped umbridge she hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said well minister miss edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me she said that if i proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor sometimes known as the room of requirement i would find out something to my advantage i questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more 
 
 well now said fudge fixing marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look it is very brave of you my dear coming to tell professor umbridge you did exactly the right thing now will you tell me what happened at this meeting what was its purpose who was there 
 
 but marietta would not speak she merely shook her head again her eyes wide and fearful 
 
 we got a for this fudge asked umbridge impatiently gesturing at face so she can speak freely 
 
 i have not yet managed to find one umbridge admitted grudgingly and harry felt a surge of pride in jinxing ability but it matter if she speak i can take up the story from here 
 
 you will remember minister that i sent you a report back in october that potter had met a number of fellow students in the head in hogsmeade 
 
 and what is your evidence for that cut in professor mcgonagall 
 
 i have testimony from willy widdershins minerva who happened to be in the bar at the time he was heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing was quite unimpaired said umbridge smugly he heard every word potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me 
 
 oh so why he prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows what an interesting insight into our justice system 
 
 blatant corruption roared the portrait of the corpulent wizard on the wall behind desk the ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day no sir they did not 
 
 thank you fortescue that will do said dumbledore softly 
 
 the purpose of meeting with these students continued professor umbridge was to persuade them to join an illegal society whose aim was to learn spells and curses the ministry has decided are inappropriate for 
 
 i think find wrong there dolores said dumbledore quietly peering at her over the spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose 
 
 harry stared at him he could not see how dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one if willy widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the head there was simply no escaping it 
 
 oho said fudge bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again yes do hear the latest story designed to pull potter out of trouble go on then dumbledore go on 
 
 willy widdershins was lying was he or was it identical twin in the head that day or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors 
 
 percy weasley let out a hearty laugh 
 
 oh very good minister very good 
 
 harry could have kicked him then he saw to his astonishment that dumbledore was smiling gently too 
 
 cornelius i do not denyand nor i am sure does harrythat he was in the head that day nor that he was trying to recruit students to a defence against the dark arts group i am merely pointing out that dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was at that time illegal if you remember the ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after hogsmeade meeting so he was not breaking any rules at all in the head 
 
 percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy fudge remained motionless in his mouth hanging open 
 
 umbridge recovered first 
 
 all very fine headmaster she said smiling sweetly but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of educational decree number if the first meeting was not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are 
 
 well said dumbledore surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers they certainly would be if they had continued after the decree came into effect do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued 
 
 as dumbledore spoke harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought kingsley whispered something he could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side a gentle something like a draught or bird wings but looking down he saw nothing there 
 
 evidence repeated umbridge with that horrible wide smile have you not been listening dumbledore why do you think miss edgecombe is here 
 
 oh can she tell us about six months worth of meetings said dumbledore raising his eyebrows i was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight 
 
 miss edgecombe said umbridge at once tell us how long these meetings have been going on dear you can simply nod or shake your head sure that make the spots worse have they been happening regularly over the last six months 
 
 harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach this was it they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even dumbledore would be able to shift aside 
 
 just nod or shake your head dear umbridge said coaxingly to marietta come on now that the jinx 
 
 everyone in the room was gazing at the top of face only her eyes were visible between the robes and her curly fringe perhaps it was a trick of the firelight but her eyes looked oddly blank and thento utter amazementmarietta shook her head 
 
 umbridge looked quickly at fudge then back at marietta 
 
 i think you understood the question did you dear asking whether been going to these meetings for the past six months you have you 
 
 again marietta shook her head 
 
 what do you mean by shaking your head dear said umbridge in a testy voice 
 
 i would have thought her meaning was quite clear said professor mcgonagall harshly there have been no secret meetings for the past six months is that correct miss edgecombe 
 
 marietta nodded 
 
 but there was a meeting tonight said umbridge furiously there was a meeting miss edgecombe you told me about it in the room of requirement and potter was the leader was he not potter organised it potterwhy are you shaking your head girl 
 
 well usually when a person shakes their head said mcgonagall coldly they mean no so unless miss edgecombe is using a form of as yet unknown to humans 
 
 professor umbridge seized marietta pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard a split second later dumbledore was on his feet his wand raised kingsley started forwards and umbridge leapt back from marietta waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned 
 
 i cannot allow you to manhandle my students dolores said dumbledore and for the first time he looked angry 
 
 you want to calm yourself madam umbridge said kingsley in his deep slow voice you want to get yourself into trouble now 
 
 no said umbridge breathlessly glancing up at the towering figure of kingsley i mean right shackleboltii forgot myself 
 
 marietta was standing exactly where umbridge had released her she seemed neither perturbed by sudden attack nor relieved by her release she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her 
 
 a sudden suspicion connected to whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into mind 
 
 dolores said fudge with the air of trying to settle something once and for all the meeting tonightthe one we know definitely happened 
 
 yes said umbridge pulling herself together yes well miss edgecombe tipped me off and i proceeded at once to the seventh floor accompanied by certain trustworthy students so as to catch those in the meeting it appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction it does not matter however i have all their names here miss parkinson ran into the room of requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind we needed evidence and the room provided 
 
 and to horror she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the room of wall and handed it to fudge 
 
 the moment i saw name on the list i knew what we were dealing with she said softly 
 
 excellent said fudge a smile spreading across his face excellent dolores and by thunder 
 
 he looked up at dumbledore who was still standing beside marietta his wand held loosely in his hand 
 
 see what named themselves said fudge quietly army 
 
 dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from fudge he gazed at the heading scribbled by hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak then he looked up smiling 
 
 well the game is up he said simply would you like a written confession from me cornelius or will a statement before these witnesses suffice 
 
 harry saw mcgonagall and kingsley look at each other there was fear in both faces he did not understand what was going on and nor apparently did fudge 
 
 statement said fudge slowly whati 
 
 army cornelius said dumbledore still smiling as he waved the list of names before face not army army 
 
 butbut 
 
 understanding blazed suddenly in face he took a horrified step backwards yelped and jumped out of the fire again 
 
 you he whispered stamping again on his smouldering cloak 
 
 right said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 you organised this 
 
 i did said dumbledore 
 
 you recruited these students forfor your army 
 
 tonight was supposed to be the first meeting said dumbledore nodding merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me i see now that it was a mistake to invite miss edgecombe of course 
 
 marietta nodded fudge looked from her to dumbledore his chest swelling 
 
 then you have been plotting against me he yelled 
 
 right said dumbledore cheerfully 
 
 no shouted harry 
 
 kingsley flashed a look of warning at him mcgonagall widened her eyes threateningly but it had suddenly dawned on harry what dumbledore was about to do and he could not let it happen 
 
 noprofessor dumbledore 
 
 be quiet harry or i am afraid you will have to leave my office said dumbledore calmly 
 
 yes shut up potter barked fudge who was still ogling dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight well well welli came here tonight expecting to expel potter and instead 
 
 instead you get to arrest me said dumbledore smiling like losing a knut and finding a galleon it 
 
 weasley cried fudge now positively quivering with delight weasley have you written it all down everything said his confession have you got it 
 
 yes sir i think so sir said percy eagerly whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his 
 
 the bit about how been trying to build up an army against the ministry how been working to destabilise me 
 
 yes sir got it yes said percy scanning his notes joyfully 
 
 very well then said fudge now radiant with glee duplicate your notes weasley and send a copy to the daily prophet at once if we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition percy dashed from the room slamming the door behind him and fudge turned back to dumbledore you will now be escorted back to the ministry where you will be formally charged then sent to azkaban to await trial 
 
 ah said dumbledore gently yes yes i thought we might hit that little snag 
 
 snag said fudge his voice still vibrating with joy i see no snag dumbledore 
 
 well said dumbledore apologetically afraid i do 
 
 oh really 
 
 just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that i am going towhat is the am afraid i am not going to come quietly at all cornelius i have absolutely no intention of being sent to azkaban i could break out of coursebut what a waste of time and frankly i can think of a whole host of things i would rather be doing 
 
 face was growing steadily redder she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water fudge stared at dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened he made a small choking noise then looked round at kingsley and the man with short grey hair who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far the latter gave fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little away from the wall harry saw his hand drift almost casually towards his pocket 
 
 be silly dawlish said dumbledore kindly sure you are an excellent aurori seem to remember that you achieved outstanding in all your newtsbut if you attempt toerbring me in by force i will have to hurt you 
 
 the man called dawlish blinked rather foolishly he looked towards fudge again but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next 
 
 so sneered fudge recovering himself you intend to take on dawlish shacklebolt dolores and myself do you dumbledore 
 
 beard no said dumbledore smiling not unless you are foolish enough to force me to 
 
 he will not be said professor mcgonagall loudly plunging her hand inside her robes 
 
 oh yes he will minerva said dumbledore sharply hogwarts needs you 
 
 enough of this rubbish said fudge pulling out his own wand dawlish shacklebolt take him 
 
 a streak of silver light flashed around the room there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled a hand grabbed the scruff of neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off several of the portraits yelled fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air coughing in the dust harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried no then there was the sound of breaking glass frantically scuffling footsteps a groan and silence 
 
 harry struggled around to see who was him and saw professor mcgonagall crouched beside him she had forced both him and marietta out of way dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them panting slightly harry saw a very tall figure moving towards them 
 
 are you all right dumbledore asked 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall getting up and dragging harry and marietta with her 
 
 the dust was clearing the wreckage of the office loomed into view desk had been overturned all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor their silver instruments in pieces fudge umbridge kingsley and dawlish lay motionless on the floor fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them singing softly 
 
 unfortunately i had to hex kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said dumbledore in a low voice he was remarkably quick on the uptake modifying miss memory like that while everyone was looking the other way thank him for me you minerva 
 
 now they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicateyou must act as though no time has passed as though they were merely knocked to the ground they will not remember 
 
 where will you go dumbledore whispered professor mcgonagall grimmauld place 
 
 oh no said dumbledore with a grim smile i am not leaving to go into hiding fudge will soon wish never dislodged me from hogwarts i promise you 
 
 professor dumbledore harry began 
 
 he did not know what to say first how sorry he was that he had started the da in the first place and caused all this trouble or how terrible he felt that dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion but dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word 
 
 listen to me harry he said urgently you must study occlumency as hard as you can do you understand me do everything professor snape tells you and practise it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreamsyou will understand why soon enough but you must promise me 
 
 the man called dawlish was stirring dumbledore seized wrist 
 
 rememberclose your mind 
 
 but as fingers closed over skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike dumbledore to bite him to hurt him 
 
 you will understand whispered dumbledore 
 
 fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him dumbledore released harry raised his hand and grasped the long golden tail there was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone 
 
 where is he yelled fudge pushing himself up from the floor where is he 
 
 i know shouted kingsley also leaping to his feet 
 
 well he have disapparated cried umbridge you do it from inside this school 
 
 the stairs cried dawlish and he flung himself upon the door wrenched it open and disappeared followed closely by kingsley and umbridge fudge hesitated then got slowly to his feet brushing dust from his front there was a long and painful silence 
 
 well minerva said fudge nastily straightening his torn shirtsleeve afraid this is the end of your friend dumbledore 
 
 you think so do you said professor mcgonagall scornfully 
 
 fudge seemed not to hear her he was looking around at the wrecked office a few of the portraits hissed at him one or two even made rude hand gestures 
 
 better get those two off to bed said fudge looking back at professor mcgonagall with a dismissive nod towards harry and marietta 
 
 professor mcgonagall said nothing but marched harry and marietta to the door as it swung closed behind them harry heard phineas voice 
 
 you know minister i disagree with dumbledore on many counts but you cannot deny got style 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
