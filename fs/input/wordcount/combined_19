 this is rather indiscreet but so charming that one is awfully tempted to tell the story said vronsky looking at her with laughing eyes i intend to mention any names 
 but i shall guess them so much the better 
 listen then two festive young men were driving along 
 officers of your regiment of course 
 i say they were officers just two young men who had been lunching 
 in other words drinking 
 possibly they were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the gayest of moods and they catch sight of a pretty woman in a hired sleigh who overtakes them looks back at them and so it seemed to them at any rate nods to them and laughs they of course follow her galloping at full speed to their amazement the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going the fair one darts upstairs to the top floor all they got was a glimpse of rosebud lips under a short veil and of exquisite little feet 
 you tell this with such feeling that it seems to me you yourself must have been one of the two 
 but what did you tell me just now well the young men enter their apartment he was giving a farewell dinner there they certainly did take a drop too much as is always the case at farewell dinners and at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house no one knows only their valet in answer to their inquiry whether any young ladies are living on the top floor answered that there were a great many of them after dinner the two young men go into their study and write a letter to the fair unknown they composed a passionate epistle really a declaration and then carry the letter upstairs themselves so as to explain whatever might prove not altogether clear in the letter 
 why do you tell me such nasty things and then 
 they ring a maidservant opens the door they hand her the letter and assure her that both so enamored that die on the spot at the door the maid stupefied carries on the negotiations suddenly a gentleman appears with side whiskers like country sausages he is as red as a lobster and informing them that there is no one living in that flat except his wife he sends them both packing 
 how do you know he had side whiskers like sausages as you put it 
 ah do but listen recently i went to make peace between them 
 well and what was the upshot 
 the most interesting part this couple turned out to be a most happy one a government clerk and his lady the government clerk lodges a complaint whereupon i become a mediator and what a mediator i assure you talleyrand was a nobody compared to me 
 just what was the difficulty 
 ah do but listen we make fitting apologies we are in despair we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding the government clerk with the country sausages begins to melt and he too desires to express his sentiments but no sooner does he begin to express them than he gets heated and says nasty things and again obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents i agree that their action was bad but i beg of you to take into consideration the misunderstanding and their youth besides the young men had just come from their lunch you understand their repentance is heartfelt and they beg you to forgive their misbehavior the government clerk was softened once more i consent count and am ready to forgive but you must understand that my wife my wife a respectable woman is subjected to annoyances and insults and impertinences by certain milksops scou yet you understand the milksop is present and it is up to me to make peace between them again i trot out all my diplomacy and again just as the matter is about to be concluded our friend the government clerk gets heated and turns red while his country sausages bristle up and i once more exert diplomatic finesse 
 ah you must hear this story said betsy laughing to a lady who was entering the box he has made me laugh so much well bonne chance she added giving vronsky the one finger free from holding her fan and with a shrug of her shoulders letting down the bodice of her gown that had worked up so as to be fittingly and fully nude as she moved forward toward the footlights into the lights of the gas and within the ken of all 
 vronsky drove to the french theater where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment who never missed a single performance there he wanted to talk over his peacemaking which had been occupying and amusing him for the last three days petritsky whom he liked was implicated in the affair as well as another fine fellow and excellent comrade who had lately joined the regiment the young prince kedrov but mainly the interests of the regiment were involved as well 
 both culprits were in squadron the colonel of the regiment had received a call from the government clerk venden with a complaint against his officers who had insulted his wife his young wife as venden told the story he had been married half a year had been at church with her mother and suddenly feeling indisposed due to her interesting condition found that she could not remain standing and drove home in the first sleigh with the mettlesome coachman she came across it was then that the officers set off in pursuit of her she was alarmed and feeling still worse ran home up the staircase venden himself on returning from his office had heard a ring at their bell and voices had stepped out and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter he had pushed them out he was asking that the culprits be severely punished 
 you may say what you will said the colonel to vronsky whom he had invited to come and see him petritsky is becoming impossible not a week goes by without some scrape this clerk chap let matters drop go on with the thing 
 vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business and that a duel was out of the question here that everything must be done to soften this government clerk and hush the matter up the colonel had called in vronsky precisely because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man but above all one to whom the honor of the regiment was dear they talked it over and decided that petritsky and kedrov must go with vronsky to this government clerk and apologize the colonel and vronsky were both fully aware that name and insignia of were bound to go a long way toward softening the government clerk and these two influences proved in fact not without effect though the result of the mediation remained as vronsky had described uncertain 
 on reaching the french theater vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel and reported to him his success or lack of it the colonel thinking it all over decided not to go on with the matter but then for his own delectation proceeded to question vronsky about the details of his interview and for a long while could not restrain his laughter as he listened to story of how the government clerk after subsiding for a while would suddenly flare up again as he recalled the details and how vronsky at the last of conciliation had skillfully maneuvered a retreat shoving petritsky out before him 
 a disgraceful scrape but a killing one kedrov really fight this gentleman so he was awfully wrought up he asked again laughing but what do you think of claire today a wonder he went on speaking of a new french actress no matter how often you see her different each time only the french who can do that

 princess betsy drove home from the theater without waiting for the end of the last act she had just time enough to go into her dressing room sprinkle her long pale face with powder rub it off set her dress to rights and order tea in the big drawing room when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house on the bolshaia morskaia her guests dismounted at the wide entrance and the stout porter who used to read newspapers mornings behind the glass door to the edification of the noiselessly opened the immense door letting the visitors pass by him into the house 
 almost at the same instant that the hostess with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face entered at one door her guests entered at the other into the drawing room a large room with dark walls downy rugs and a brightly lighted table gleaming with the light of candles the whiteness of napery the silver of the samovar and the tea service of transparent porcelain 
 the hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves chairs were set with the aid of footmen moving almost imperceptibly about the room the party settled itself divided into two groups one round the samovar near the hostess the other at the opposite end of the drawing room round the handsome wife of an ambassador in black velvet with sharply defined black eyebrows in both groups conversation wavered as it always does for the first few minutes broken up by meetings salutations offers of tea and as it were seeking for some point in common 
 exceptionally fine as an actress one can see studied kaulbach said a diplomatist in the circle of the wife did you notice how she fell down 
 oh please let us talk about nilsson no one can possibly say anything new about her said a fat lady without eyebrows and without chignon wearing an old silk dress this was princess miaghkaia noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners and nicknamed enfant terrible princess miaghkaia was seated halfway between the two groups and listening to both took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today just as though they had conspired and i know why that phrase should be so much to their liking 
 the conversation was cut short by this observation and again a new subject had to be thought of 
 do tell us something amusing yet not spiteful said the wife a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english small talk she addressed the diplomatist who was now at a loss just what to begin upon 
 that is said to be a difficult task only that which is spiteful is supposed to be amusing he began with a smile however make the attempt give me a theme all a matter of the theme if the theme be but given easy enough to embroider it i often think that the celebrated conversationalists of the last century would find it difficult to talk cleverly now everything clever has become such a bore 
 that has been said long ago the wife interrupted him laughing 
 the conversation had begun amiably but just because it was too amiable it came to a stop again they had to have recourse to the sure remedy malicious gossip 
 you think something louis quinze about tushkevich he said glancing toward a handsome young man standing at the table 
 oh yes in the same style as the drawing room and why it is so often here 
 this conversation was kept up since it depended on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say of the relations of tushkevich with their hostess 
 round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having in the meanwhile vacillated in precisely the same way between the three inevitable topics the latest piece of public news the theater and censuring the fellow creature had finally come to rest on the last topic that is malicious gossip 
 have you heard that even the maltishcheva the mother not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color 
 impossible no just charming 
 i wonder that with her sense for after all no fool she see how funny she is 
 every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the hapless maltishcheva and the conversation crackled merrily like a blazing bonfire 
 the husband of princess betsy a corpulent man an ardent collector of engravings hearing that his wife had visitors had come into the drawing room before leaving for his club stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs he approached princess miaghkaia 
 how did you like nilsson he asked 
 oh how can you steal up on anyone like that how you startled me she responded please talk to me about the opera you know nothing about music rather come down to your own level and discuss with you your majolica and engravings come now what treasure have you been buying lately at the rag fair 
 would you like me to show you but you understand such things 
 yes show me been learning about them at those their names those bankers they have some splendid engravings they showed them to us 
 why have you been at the schutzburgs asked the hostess from behind the samovar 
 yes ma chre they asked my husband and myself to dinner and i was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand roubles princess miaghkaia said speaking loudly conscious that all were listening and very nasty sauce it was some green mess we had to ask them and i made a sauce for kopecks and everybody was very much pleased with it i afford sauces 
 unique said the lady of the house 
 amazing somebody else added 
 the effect produced by princess speeches was always the same and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately as now she said homely truths not devoid of sense in the society in which she lived such utterances had the same result as the most pungent wit princess miaghkaia could never see why it had that result but she knew it had and took advantage of it 
 since everyone had been listening while princess miaghkaia spoke and the conversation around the wife had dropped princess betsy tried to bring the whole party together and she addressed the wife 
 really you have tea do come and join us 
 no very comfortable here the wife responded with a smile and went on with the interrupted conversation 
 it was a most agreeable conversation they were censuring the karenins husband and wife 
 anna is quite changed since her stay in moscow something strange about her said one of her feminine friends 
 the great change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of alexei vronsky said the wife 
 well what of it a fable of about a man without a shadow a man deprived of his shadow as a punishment for something or other i never could understand just how this was a punishment yet a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow 
 yes but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end said friend 
 bite your tongue said princess miaghkaia suddenly karenina is a splendid woman i like her husband but her i like very much 
 why you like her husband such a remarkable man said the wife my husband says there are few statesmen like him in europe 
 and my husband tells me just the same but i believe it said princess miaghkaia if our husbands talk to us we should see the facts as they are alexei alexandrovich to my thinking is simply a fool i say it in a whisper but it really make everything clear before when i was told to consider him clever i kept looking for his ability and thought myself a fool for not seeing it but directly i said a fool though only in a whisper everything became clear that so 
 how spiteful you are today 
 not a bit no other way out of it one of us two had to be the fool and as you know one could never say that of oneself 
 no one is satisfied with his fortune and everyone is satisfied with his wit the diplomatist repeated the french saying 
 it just it princess miaghkaia turned to him promptly but the point is that i abandon anna to your mercies such a dear so charming how can she help it if all in love with her and follow her about like shadows 
 oh i had no idea of censuring her friend said in 
 if we have no shadows following us it does not prove that any right to blame her 
 and having duly disposed of friend the princess miaghkaia got up and together with the wife joined the group at the table where the general conversation had to do with the king of prussia 
 what were you gossiping so maliciously about asked betsy 
 about the karenins the princess gave us a character sketch of alexei alexandrovich said the wife with a smile as she sat down at the table 
 pity we hear it said princess betsy glancing toward the door ah here you are at last she said turning with a smile to vronsky who was entering 
 vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here he saw them all every day and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people whom one had left only a short while ago 
 where do i come from he repeated the question of the wife well no help for it i must confess from the opera bouffe i do believe seen it a hundred times and always with fresh enjoyment exquisite i know disgraceful but i go to sleep at the opera yet i sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute and enjoy it this evening 
 he mentioned a french actress and was about to tell something about her but the wife with playful trepidation cut him short 
 please tell us about that horror 
 very well i especially as everyone knows those horrors 
 and we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing like the opera chimed in princess miaghkaia

 steps were heard at the door and princess betsy knowing it was madame karenina glanced at vronsky he was looking toward the door and his face wore a strange new expression joyfully intently and at the same time timidly he gazed at the approaching figure and slowly he rose to his feet anna walked into the drawing room holding herself extremely erect as always looking straight before her and moving with her swift resolute and light step that distinguished her walk from that of other society women she crossed the few paces that separated her from her hostess shook hands with her smiled and with the same smile looked around at vronsky vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her 
 she acknowledged this only by a slight nod flushed and frowned but immediately while rapidly greeting her acquaintances and shaking the hands proffered to her she addressed princess betsy 
 i have been at countess and meant to have come here earlier but i stayed on sir john was there a most interesting man 
 oh this missionary 
 yes he told us about life in india most interestingly 
 the conversation interrupted by her coming in flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out 
 sir john yes sir john seen him he speaks well vlassieva is altogether in love with him 
 and is it true that the younger vlassieva is to marry topov 
 yes they say quite settled 
 i wonder at the parents they say a marriage of passion 
 of passion what antediluvian notions you have whoever talks of passion nowadays said the wife 
 what would you do this silly old fashion is still far from dead said vronsky 
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence 
 yes but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages is scattered like dust precisely because that passion to which recognition has been denied appears on the scene said vronsky 
 but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already like scarlatina one has to go through with it and get it over with 
 in that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love like 
 i was in love in my young days with a church clerk said the princess miaghkaia i know that it did me any good 
 no i think all jokes aside that to know love one must first make a fault and then mend it said princess betsy 
 even after marriage said the wife playfully 
 never too late to mend the diplomatist repeated the english proverb 
 just so betsy agreed one must make a mistake and rectify it what do you think about it she turned to anna who with a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips was listening to the conversation 
 i think said anna playing with the glove she had taken off i think if there are as many minds as there are heads then surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts 
 vronsky was gazing at anna and with a heart sinking was waiting for what she would say he sighed as after a danger escaped when she had uttered these words 
 anna suddenly turned to him 
 oh i have had a letter from moscow they write me that kitty very ill 
 really said vronsky knitting his brows 
 anna looked sternly at him 
 that interest you 
 on the contrary it does very much what is it exactly that they write you if may know he asked 
 anna got up and went to betsy 
 give me a cup of tea she said pausing behind her chair 
 while betsy was pouring out the tea vronsky walked up to anna 
 what is it they write you he repeated 
 i often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable though forever talking of it said anna without answering him wanted to tell you something for a long while she added and moving a few steps away she sat down at a corner table which held albums 
 i quite understand the significance of your words he said handing her the cup 
 she glanced towards the sofa beside her and he instantly sat down 
 yes wanted to tell you she said without looking at him your action was wrong wrong very wrong 
 do you suppose i know that acted wrongly but who was the cause of my doing so 
 why do you say that to me she said looking at him sternly 
 you know why he answered boldly and joyously meeting her glance and without dropping his eyes 
 it was not he but she who became confused 
 that merely proves you have no heart she said but her eyes said that she knew he had a heart and that was why she was afraid of him 
 what you spoke of just now was a mistake and not love 
 remember that i have forbidden you to utter that word that detestable word said anna with a shudder but at once she felt that by that very word forbidden she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love i have long meant to tell you this she went on looking resolutely into his eyes and all aflame from the burning flush on her cheeks come here purposely this evening knowing i should meet you i have come to tell you that this must end i have never blushed before anyone and you force me to feel guilty of something 
 he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face 
 what do you wish of me he said simply and gravely 
 i want you to go to moscow and ask for forgiveness she said 
 that is not your wish he said 
 he saw she was saying what she was forcing herself to say not what she wanted to say 
 if you love me as you say she whispered you will do this so that i may be at peace 
 his face grew radiant 
 you know that all my life to me but i know no peace and i give it to you all of myself and love yes i think of you and myself apart you and i are one to me and i see no possibility before us of peace either for me or for you i see a possibility of despair of wretchedness or else i see a possibility of happiness and what a happiness can it be impossible he added his lips barely moving yet she heard 
 she strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said but instead of that she let her eyes rest on him full of love and made no answer 
 come he thought in ecstasy when i was beginning to despair and it seemed there would be no end come she loves me she owns it 
 then do this for me never say such things to me and let us be friends she said in words but her eyes spoke quite differently 
 friends we shall never be that you know yourself whether we shall be the happiest or the most wretched of people that lies within your power 
 she would have said something but he interrupted her 
 for i ask but one thing i ask for the right to hope to suffer even as i am doing now but if even that cannot be command me to disappear and i disappear you shall not see me if my presence is painful to you 
 i want to drive you away 
 only change anything leave everything as it is said he in a shaky voice your husband 
 at that instant alexei alexandrovich did in fact walk into the room with his calm ungainly gait 
 glancing at his wife and vronsky he went up to the lady of the house and sitting down for a cup of tea began talking in his unhasty always audible voice in his habitual tone of banter as if he were teasing someone 
 your rambouillet is in full conclave he said looking round at all the party the graces and the muses 
 but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering as she called it using the english word and like a clever hostess she at once brought him around to a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription alexei alexandrovich was immediately carried away by the subject and began seriously defending the new imperial decree before princess betsy who had attacked it 
 vronsky and anna still sat at the little table 
 this is getting indecorous whispered one lady with an expressive glance at madame karenina her husband and vronsky 
 what did i tell you said friend 
 but it was not only these ladies who watched them almost everyone in the room even the princess miaghkaia and betsy herself looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle as though they found it a hindrance alexei alexandrovich was the only person who did not once look in their direction and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon 
 noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone princess betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to alexei alexandrovich and walked over to anna 
 always amazed at the clearness and precision of your language she said the most transcendent ideas seem to be within my grasp when speaking 
 oh yes said anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a word of what betsy had said she crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation 
 alexei alexandrovich after staying half an hour walked up to his wife and suggested that they go home together but she answered without looking at him that she was staying to supper alexei alexandrovich bowed himself out 
 the fat old tatar madame coachman in a glistening leather coat was with difficulty bridling the left of her pair of grays chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance a footman stood by the carriage door he had opened the hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand was unfastening the lace of her sleeve caught in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head was listening rapturously to the words vronsky murmured as he saw her down to her carriage 
 said nothing of course and i ask nothing he was saying but you know that friendship is not what i want that only one happiness in life for me that word you dislike so yes love 
 love she repeated slowly in an inner voice and suddenly at the very instant she unhooked the lace she added i like the word precisely because it means too much to me far more than you can understand and she glanced into his face 
 she gave him her hand and with her rapid springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage 
 her glance the touch of her hand had seared him he kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it and went home happy in the realization that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the two last months

 she acknowledged this only by a slight nod flushed and frowned but immediately while rapidly greeting her acquaintances and shaking the hands proffered to her she addressed princess betsy 
 i have been at countess and meant to have come here earlier but i stayed on sir john was there a most interesting man 
 oh this missionary 
 yes he told us about life in india most interestingly 
 the conversation interrupted by her coming in flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out 
 sir john yes sir john seen him he speaks well vlassieva is altogether in love with him 
 and is it true that the younger vlassieva is to marry topov 
 yes they say quite settled 
 i wonder at the parents they say a marriage of passion 
 of passion what antediluvian notions you have whoever talks of passion nowadays said the wife 
 what would you do this silly old fashion is still far from dead said vronsky 
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence 
 yes but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages is scattered like dust precisely because that passion to which recognition has been denied appears on the scene said vronsky 
 but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already like scarlatina one has to go through with it and get it over with 
 in that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love like 
 i was in love in my young days with a church clerk said the princess miaghkaia i know that it did me any good 
 no i think all jokes aside that to know love one must first make a fault and then mend it said princess betsy 
 even after marriage said the wife playfully 
 never too late to mend the diplomatist repeated the english proverb 
 just so betsy agreed one must make a mistake and rectify it what do you think about it she turned to anna who with a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips was listening to the conversation 
 i think said anna playing with the glove she had taken off i think if there are as many minds as there are heads then surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts 
 vronsky was gazing at anna and with a heart sinking was waiting for what she would say he sighed as after a danger escaped when she had uttered these words 
 anna suddenly turned to him 
 oh i have had a letter from moscow they write me that kitty very ill 
 really said vronsky knitting his brows 
 anna looked sternly at him 
 that interest you 
 on the contrary it does very much what is it exactly that they write you if may know he asked 
 anna got up and went to betsy 
 give me a cup of tea she said pausing behind her chair 
 while betsy was pouring out the tea vronsky walked up to anna 
 what is it they write you he repeated 
 i often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable though forever talking of it said anna without answering him wanted to tell you something for a long while she added and moving a few steps away she sat down at a corner table which held albums 
 i quite understand the significance of your words he said handing her the cup 
 she glanced towards the sofa beside her and he instantly sat down 
 yes wanted to tell you she said without looking at him your action was wrong wrong very wrong 
 do you suppose i know that acted wrongly but who was the cause of my doing so 
 why do you say that to me she said looking at him sternly 
 you know why he answered boldly and joyously meeting her glance and without dropping his eyes 
 it was not he but she who became confused 
 that merely proves you have no heart she said but her eyes said that she knew he had a heart and that was why she was afraid of him 
 what you spoke of just now was a mistake and not love 
 remember that i have forbidden you to utter that word that detestable word said anna with a shudder but at once she felt that by that very word forbidden she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love i have long meant to tell you this she went on looking resolutely into his eyes and all aflame from the burning flush on her cheeks come here purposely this evening knowing i should meet you i have come to tell you that this must end i have never blushed before anyone and you force me to feel guilty of something 
 he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face 
 what do you wish of me he said simply and gravely 
 i want you to go to moscow and ask for forgiveness she said 
 that is not your wish he said 
 he saw she was saying what she was forcing herself to say not what she wanted to say 
 if you love me as you say she whispered you will do this so that i may be at peace 
 his face grew radiant 
 you know that all my life to me but i know no peace and i give it to you all of myself and love yes i think of you and myself apart you and i are one to me and i see no possibility before us of peace either for me or for you i see a possibility of despair of wretchedness or else i see a possibility of happiness and what a happiness can it be impossible he added his lips barely moving yet she heard 
 she strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said but instead of that she let her eyes rest on him full of love and made no answer 
 come he thought in ecstasy when i was beginning to despair and it seemed there would be no end come she loves me she owns it 
 then do this for me never say such things to me and let us be friends she said in words but her eyes spoke quite differently 
 friends we shall never be that you know yourself whether we shall be the happiest or the most wretched of people that lies within your power 
 she would have said something but he interrupted her 
 for i ask but one thing i ask for the right to hope to suffer even as i am doing now but if even that cannot be command me to disappear and i disappear you shall not see me if my presence is painful to you 
 i want to drive you away 
 only change anything leave everything as it is said he in a shaky voice your husband 
 at that instant alexei alexandrovich did in fact walk into the room with his calm ungainly gait 
 glancing at his wife and vronsky he went up to the lady of the house and sitting down for a cup of tea began talking in his unhasty always audible voice in his habitual tone of banter as if he were teasing someone 
 your rambouillet is in full conclave he said looking round at all the party the graces and the muses 
 but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering as she called it using the english word and like a clever hostess she at once brought him around to a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription alexei alexandrovich was immediately carried away by the subject and began seriously defending the new imperial decree before princess betsy who had attacked it 
 vronsky and anna still sat at the little table 
 this is getting indecorous whispered one lady with an expressive glance at madame karenina her husband and vronsky 
 what did i tell you said friend 
 but it was not only these ladies who watched them almost everyone in the room even the princess miaghkaia and betsy herself looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle as though they found it a hindrance alexei alexandrovich was the only person who did not once look in their direction and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon 
 noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone princess betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to alexei alexandrovich and walked over to anna 
 always amazed at the clearness and precision of your language she said the most transcendent ideas seem to be within my grasp when speaking 
 oh yes said anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a word of what betsy had said she crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation 
 alexei alexandrovich after staying half an hour walked up to his wife and suggested that they go home together but she answered without looking at him that she was staying to supper alexei alexandrovich bowed himself out 
 the fat old tatar madame coachman in a glistening leather coat was with difficulty bridling the left of her pair of grays chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance a footman stood by the carriage door he had opened the hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand was unfastening the lace of her sleeve caught in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head was listening rapturously to the words vronsky murmured as he saw her down to her carriage 
 said nothing of course and i ask nothing he was saying but you know that friendship is not what i want that only one happiness in life for me that word you dislike so yes love 
 love she repeated slowly in an inner voice and suddenly at the very instant she unhooked the lace she added i like the word precisely because it means too much to me far more than you can understand and she glanced into his face 
 she gave him her hand and with her rapid springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage 
 her glance the touch of her hand had seared him he kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it and went home happy in the realization that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the two last months

 alexei alexandrovich had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with him about something but he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared as something striking and improper and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper he made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife 
 on reaching home alexei alexandrovich went to his study as he usually did seated himself in his low chair opened a book on the papacy at the place he had marked by inserting the paper knife read till one just as he usually did but from time to time he would rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna had not yet come in with a book under his arm he went upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her contrary to his usual habit he did not get into bed but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back he could not go to bed feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the situation that had just arisen 
 when alexei alexandrovich had made up his mind that he must have a talk with his wife it had seemed a very easy and simple matter but now when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself it seemed to him very complicated and difficult 
 alexei alexandrovich was not jealous jealousy according to his notions was an insult to wife and one ought to have confidence in wife why one ought to have that confidence that is to say a complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself but he had never experienced such a lack of confidence because he had confidence in her and told himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence had not broken down he still felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and fatuous and did not know what ought to be done alexei alexandrovich was standing face to face with life with the possibility of his loving someone other than himself and this seemed to him very fatuous and incomprehensible because it was of the very stuff of life all his life alexei alexandrovich had lived and worked in official spheres having to do merely with the reflections of life and every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken and that there is a chasm below that chasm was life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexei alexandrovich had lived for the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his loving someone else and he was horrified at it 
 he did not undress but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room where one lamp was burning over the carpet of the dark drawing room in which the light was reflected merely on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candles burned lighting up the portraits of her parents and feminine friends and the pretty knickknacks of her writing table every one of which he knew so well he walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turned back again 
 at each turn in his walk especially on the parquet of the dining room he halted and said to himself yes this i must decide and put a stop to i must express my view of it and my decision and he turned back again but just what shall i express and what decision he would say to himself in the drawing room and found no answer but after all he asked himself before turning into the boudoir what has occurred nothing she was talking a long while with him but what of that surely women in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy means debasing both her and myself he soliloquized as he entered her boudoir but this dictum which had always had such weight with him before had now no weight and no meaning whatsoever and from the bedroom door he turned back again but as he entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so and that if others had noticed it meant that there was something and he said to himself again in the dining room yes i must decide and put a stop to it and express my views and again at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself decide how and again he asked inwardly what has occurred and answered nothing and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawing room he was convinced that something had happened his thoughts like his body were describing a complete circle without alighting upon anything new he noticed this rubbed his forehead and sat down in her boudoir 
 there looking at her table with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter his thoughts suddenly changed he began to think of her of what her thoughts and emotions must be for the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life her ideas her desires and the thought that she could and must have a separate life of her own seemed to him so appalling that he made haste to drive it away it was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another place was a spiritual action foreign to alexei alexandrovich he looked on this spiritual action as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy 
 and the worst of it all thought he is that just now at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time when i stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies just now this stupid worry has to come falling about my ears but to be done not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them 
 i must think this over come to a decision and put it out of my mind he said aloud 
 the question of her feelings of what has passed and may be passing in her soul not my affair the affair of her conscience and falls under the head of religion he said to himself feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred 
 and so alexei alexandrovich said to himself questions as to her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience with which i can have nothing to do my duty is clearly defined as the head of the family i am a person bound in duty to guide her and consequently in part the person responsible i am bound to point out the danger i perceive to warn her even to use my authority i ought to speak plainly to her 
 and everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in alexei head thinking over what he would say he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption with so little to show for it but in spite of that the form and consistency of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report i must speak on and express fully the following points first an explanation of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum secondly an explanation of the religious significance of marriage thirdly if need be a reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son fourthly a reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself and interlacing his fingers the palms downward alexei alexandrovich stretched his hands and the joints of the fingers cracked 
 this gesture this bad habit the joining of his hands cracking his fingers always soothed him and gave precision to his thoughts so needful to him now there was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door alexei alexandrovich halted in the middle of the room 
 a step was heard mounting the stairs alexei alexandrovich ready for his speech stood squeezing his crossed fingers waiting for their crack to come again one joint cracked 
 already from the sound of light steps on the stairs he was aware that she was close and though he was satisfied with his speech he felt frightened because of the explanation confronting him

 anna came in with her head bent playing with the tassels of her hood her face was glowing with a vivid glow but this glow was not one of joyousness it recalled the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on seeing her husband anna raised her head and smiled as though she had just waked up 
 not in bed what a miracle she said throwing off her hood and without stopping she went on into the dressing room late alexei alexandrovich she said from behind the door 
 anna i must have a talk with you 
 with me she said wonderingly she came out from the door and looked at him why what is it what about she asked sitting down well talk if so necessary but it would be better to go to sleep 
 anna was saying whatever came to her tongue and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy she felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her 
 anna i must warn you he began 
 warn me she said of what 
 she looked at him so simply so brightly that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him it meant a great deal to see now that she did not care to notice his state of mind that she did not care to say a word about herself he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were now closed against him more than that he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that but seemed to be saying straightforwardly to him yes it is closed now which is as it should be and will be so in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have who returning home finds his own house locked up but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexei alexandrovich 
 i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with quiet intervals attracted attention 
 he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look and as he talked he felt all the uselessness and futility of his words 
 always like that she answered as though completely misapprehending him and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase one time you like my being dull and another time you like my being lively i dull does that offend you 
 alexei alexandrovich shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack 
 oh please do that i dislike it so she said 
 anna is this you said alexei alexandrovich quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his hands 
 but what is it all about she said with such genuine and droll wonder what do you want of me 
 alexei alexandrovich paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against some imaginary barrier 
 this is what i meant to say to you he went on coldly and composedly and i beg you to hear me to the end i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be guided by it but there are certain rules of decency which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i who observed it but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what one would desire 
 i positively understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he care she thought but other people noticed it and what upsets him not well alexei alexandrovich she added and getting up was about to pass through the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her 
 his face was gloomy and forbidding as anna had never seen it before she stopped and bending her head back and to one side began taking out her hairpins with her hand 
 well listening what does follow she said calmly and ironically and indeed i am listening even with interest for i should like to understand what it is all about 
 she spoke and marveled at the confident calm and natural tone in which she spoke and at the choice of the words she used 
 to enter into all the details of your feelings i have no right and besides i regard that as useless and even harmful began alexei alexandrovich rummaging in our souls we often bring up something that might have otherwise lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience but i am in duty bound to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement 
 i understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins 
 anna for sake speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken but believe me that which i am saying i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you 
 for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the phrase i love threw her into revolt again she thought love can he love if he heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he even know what love is 
 alexei alexandrovich i really do not understand she said define what it is you consider 
 pardon let me say all i have to say i love you but i am not speaking of myself the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself it may very well be i repeat that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them then i beg you to think a little and if your heart prompts you to speak out to me 
 alexei alexandrovich was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared 
 i have nothing to say and besides she said suddenly with difficulty repressing a smile really time to be in bed 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and without saying more went into the bedroom 
 when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and forgot about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexei alexandrovich seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after a pause of one or two breaths the snore sounded again with a new tranquil rhythm 
 late late she whispered with a smile a long while she lay without moving and with open eyes whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness

 this is what i meant to say to you he went on coldly and composedly and i beg you to hear me to the end i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be guided by it but there are certain rules of decency which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i who observed it but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what one would desire 
 i positively understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he care she thought but other people noticed it and what upsets him not well alexei alexandrovich she added and getting up was about to pass through the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her 
 his face was gloomy and forbidding as anna had never seen it before she stopped and bending her head back and to one side began taking out her hairpins with her hand 
 well listening what does follow she said calmly and ironically and indeed i am listening even with interest for i should like to understand what it is all about 
 she spoke and marveled at the confident calm and natural tone in which she spoke and at the choice of the words she used 
 to enter into all the details of your feelings i have no right and besides i regard that as useless and even harmful began alexei alexandrovich rummaging in our souls we often bring up something that might have otherwise lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience but i am in duty bound to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement 
 i understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins 
 anna for sake speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken but believe me that which i am saying i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you 
 for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the phrase i love threw her into revolt again she thought love can he love if he heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he even know what love is 
 alexei alexandrovich i really do not understand she said define what it is you consider 
 pardon let me say all i have to say i love you but i am not speaking of myself the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself it may very well be i repeat that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them then i beg you to think a little and if your heart prompts you to speak out to me 
 alexei alexandrovich was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared 
 i have nothing to say and besides she said suddenly with difficulty repressing a smile really time to be in bed 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and without saying more went into the bedroom 
 when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and forgot about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexei alexandrovich seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after a pause of one or two breaths the snore sounded again with a new tranquil rhythm 
 late late she whispered with a smile a long while she lay without moving and with open eyes whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness

 from that time a new life began for alexei alexandrovich and for his wife nothing special happened anna went out into society as she had always done was particularly often at princess and met vronsky everywhere alexei alexandrovich saw this but was powerless to do anything all his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate made up of a sort of amused perplexity outwardly everything was the same but their inner relations were completely changed alexei alexandrovich a man of great power in the world of politics felt himself helpless in this matter like an ox with head bent submissively he waited the fall of the poleax which he felt was lifted over him every time he began to think about it he felt that he must try once more that by kindness tenderness and persuasion there was still hope of saving her of bringing her back to herself and every day he was on the verge of talking to her but every time he began he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit which had taken possession of her had possession of him too and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that which he had meant to use involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of bantering at anyone who should say what he was saying and in that tone it was impossible to say to her what the occasion demanded

 that which to vronsky had been for almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life replacing all his old desires that which to anna had been an impossible terrible and for that very reason a more entrancing dream of happiness that desire had been fulfilled he stood before her pale his lower jaw quivering and besought her to be calm without himself knowing how or why 
 anna anna he said with a quivering voice anna for sake 
 but the louder he spoke the lower she cast down her once proud and gay but now head and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting down on the floor at his feet she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her 
 my god forgive me she said sobbing pressing his hands to her bosom 
 she felt so sinful so guilty that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness and as now there was no one in her life but him to him too she addressed her prayer for forgiveness looking at him she had a physical sense of her humiliation and she could say nothing more and he felt as a murderer must feel when he beholds the body he has robbed of life that body robbed by him of life was their love the first stage of their love there was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame shame at her spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him but in spite of all the horror before the body of his victim he must hack it to pieces hide the body must use what the murderer had gained by his murder 
 and as the murderer with fury and as it were with passion falls on the body and drags it and hacks at it so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses she held his hand and did not stir yes these kisses that is what has been bought by this shame yes and this one hand which will always be mine the hand of my accomplice she lifted up that hand and kissed it he sank on his knees and tried to see her face but she hid it and said nothing at last as though making an effort over herself she got up and pushed him away her face was still as beautiful but it was only the more pitiful for that 
 all is over she said i have nothing but you remember that 
 i can never forget what is my whole life for one instant of this happiness 
 happiness she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him for sake not a word not a word more 
 she rose quickly and moved away from him 
 not a word more she repeated and with a look of chill despair incomprehensible to him she parted from him she felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame of rapture and of horror at this stepping into a new life and she did not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words but later too and the next day and the day after she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of those feelings indeed she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul 
 she said to herself no just now i think of it later on when i am calmer but this calm for thoughts never came every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her and what she ought to do a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away 
 later later she said when i am calmer 
 but in her dreams when she had no control over her thoughts her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunted her almost every night she dreamed that both were husbands at once that both were lavishing caresses on her alexei alexandrovich was weeping kissing her hands and saying how happy we are now and alexei vronsky was there too and he too was her husband and she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her was explaining to them laughing that this was ever so much simpler and that now both of them were happy and contented but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare and she would awake from it in terror

 chapter 
 
 levin put on his big boots and for the first time a cloth overcoat instead of his fur cloak and went out to look after his farm stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes and stepping one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud 
 spring is the time of plans and projects and as he came out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects first of all he went to the cattle the cows had been let out into their paddock and their smooth sides were already glossy with their new sleek spring coats they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow and the calves to be let into the paddock the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girls picking up their petticoats ran splashing through the mud with bare legs still white not yet brown from the sun waving brushwood in their hands chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring 
 after admiring the increase of that year which were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a cow and daughter at three months old was as big as a yearling levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks but it appeared that since the paddock had not been used during the winter the racks made in the autumn were broken he sent for the carpenter who according to his orders ought to have been at work at the threshing machine but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows which ought to have been repaired before lent this was very annoying to levin it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years the racks as he ascertained being not wanted in winter had been carried to the cart horses stable and there broken as they were of light construction only meant for foddering calves moreover it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters had not been put into repair and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field levin sent for his bailiff but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff beaming all over like everything that day in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan came out of the barn twisting a bit of straw in his hands 
 why the carpenter at the threshing machine 
 oh i meant to tell you yesterday the harrows want repairing here time they got to work in the fields 
 but what were they doing in the winter then 
 but what did you want the carpenter for 
 where are the racks for the calves paddock 
 i ordered them to be got ready what would you have with those people said the bailiff with a wave of his hand 
 not those people but this bailiff said levin getting angry why what do i keep you for he cried but bethinking himself that this would not help matters he stopped short in the middle of a sentence and merely sighed well what do you say can sowing begin he asked after a pause 
 behind turkino tomorrow or next day they might begin 
 and the clover 
 sent vassilii and mishka sowing it only i know if manage to get through so slushy 
 how many dessiatinas 
 six 
 why not sow all cried levin 
 that they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas not in all the twenty was still more annoying to him clover as he knew both from books and from his own experience never did well except when it was sown as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this done 
 no one to send what would you do with such people three turned up and semion 
 well you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter 
 and so i have as it is 
 where are the peasants then 
 five are making compote which meant compost and four are shifting the oats for fear of being touched konstantin dmitrich 
 levin knew very well that touching meant that his english seed oats were already spoiled again they had not done as he had ordered 
 why but i told you during lent to put in pipes he cried 
 be put out we shall get it all done in time 
 levin made an angry gesture and went into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats were not yet spoiled but the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary and arranging for this to be done and taking two laborers from there for sowing clover levin got over the vexation his bailiff had caused him indeed it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry 
 ignat he called to the coachman who with his sleeves tucked up was washing the carriage wheels saddle 
 which sir 
 well let it be kolpik 
 yes sir 
 while they were saddling his horse levin again called the bailiff who was hanging about in sight to make it up with him and began talking to him about the spring operations before them and his plans for the farming 
 the wagons were to begin carting manure earlier so as to get all done before the early mowing and the plowing of the outlying land was to go on without a break so as to let it lie black fallow and furrowed and the moving to be all done by hired labor not on 
 the bailiff listened attentively and obviously made an effort to approve of his projects but still he had that look levin knew so well that always irritated him a look of hopelessness and despondency that look said all very well but as god wills 
 nothing mortified levin so much as that tone but it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had they had all taken that attitude to his plans and so now he was not angered by it but mortified and felt all the more roused to struggle against this apparently elemental force continually ranged against him for which he could find no other name than as god wills 
 if we can manage it konstantin dmitrich said the bailiff 
 why you manage it 
 we positively must have fifteen laborers more and they turn up there were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer 
 levin was silent again he was brought face to face with that opposing force he knew that however much they tried they could not hire more than forty perhaps or laborers for a reasonable sum some forty had been taken on and there were no more but still he could not help struggling against it 
 send to sury to chefirovka if they come we must look for them 
 send to be sure said vassilii fiodorovich despondently but then there are the horses not good for much 
 get some more i know of course levin added laughing you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as possible but this year not going to let you have things your own way see to everything myself 
 why i think you take much rest as it is it cheers us up to work under the eye 
 so sowing clover behind the birch dale go and have a look at them he said mounting the little bay cob kolpik who was led up by the coachman 
 you get across the stream konstantin dmitrich the coachman shouted 
 all right go by the forest 
 and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity ambling easily snorting over the pools and asking as it were for guidance 
 if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open country swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he rode through his forest over the crumbling wasted snow still left in parts and covered with dissolving tracks he rejoiced over every tree with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots when he came out of the forest in the immense plain before him his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horse and colt trampling down his young grass he told a peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he met on the way and asked well ipat shall we soon be sowing we must get the plowing done first konstantin dmitrich answered ipat the farther he rode the happier he became and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders so that the snow should not lie under them to divide them up into six fields of tillage and three for pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land and then three hundred dessiatinas of wheat one hundred of potatoes and one hundred and fifty of clover and not a dessiatina exhausted 
 absorbed in such dreams carefully keeping his horse by the hedges so as not to trample his young winter fields he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover a telega with the seed in it was standing not at the edge but in the middle of the tillage and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse both the laborers were sitting in the hedge probably smoking a pipe turn and turn about the earth in the telega with which the seed was mixed was not crushed to powder but crusted together or adhering in clods seeing the master the laborer vassilii went toward the telega while mishka set to work sowing this was not as it should be but with the laborers levin seldom lost his temper when vassilii came up levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge 
 never mind sir spring up again responded vassilii 
 please argue said levin but do as told 
 yes sir answered vassilii and he took the head what a sowing konstantin dmitrich he said ingratiatingly only a work to get about a fellow drags thirty pounds of earth at every step 
 why is it you have earth not sifted said levin 
 well we crumble it up answered vassilii taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms 
 vassilii was not to blame for their having fired up his telega with unsifted earth but still it was annoying 
 levin had already more than once tried a way he knew for stifling his anger and turning all that seemed dark right again and he tried that way now he watched how mishka strode along swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot and getting off his horse he took the sieve from vassilii and started sowing himself 
 where did you stop 
 vassilii pointed to the mark with his foot and levin went forward as best he could scattering the seed on the land walking was as difficult as on a bog and by the time levin had ended the row he was in a great heat and stopping gave the sieve over to vassilii 
 well master when here mind you scold me for this row said vassilii 
 eh said levin cheerily already feeling the effect of his method 
 why see in the summertime look different look you where i sowed last spring how i did work at it i do my best konstantin dmitrich see as i would for my own father i like botchwork myself nor would i let another man do it good for the master is good for us too it does heart good said vassilii pointing to look over yonder 
 a lovely spring vassilii 
 why a spring such as even the old men remember the like of i was up home my father there has sown wheat too three osminas of it he was saying you tell it from rye 
 have you been sowing wheat long 
 why sir it was you taught us the year before last you gave me two measures we sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas 
 well mind you crumble up the clods said levin going toward his horse and keep an eye on mishka and if a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every dessiatina 
 thank you kindly we are very well content sir with your treatment as it is 
 levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last clover was and the one which was plowed ready for the spring corn 
 the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent it had revived already and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last wheat the horse sank in up to the pasterns and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the ground over the plowland the riding was utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice and in the thawing furrows he sank in deep at each step the plowland was in splendid condition in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing everything was capital everything was cheering levin rode back across the streams hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across and startled two ducks there must be woodcock here too he thought and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper who confirmed his theory about the woodcock 
 levin went home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening

 chapter 
 
 levin put on his big boots and for the first time a cloth overcoat instead of his fur cloak and went out to look after his farm stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes and stepping one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud 
 spring is the time of plans and projects and as he came out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects first of all he went to the cattle the cows had been let out into their paddock and their smooth sides were already glossy with their new sleek spring coats they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow and the calves to be let into the paddock the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girls picking up their petticoats ran splashing through the mud with bare legs still white not yet brown from the sun waving brushwood in their hands chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring 
 after admiring the increase of that year which were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a cow and daughter at three months old was as big as a yearling levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks but it appeared that since the paddock had not been used during the winter the racks made in the autumn were broken he sent for the carpenter who according to his orders ought to have been at work at the threshing machine but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows which ought to have been repaired before lent this was very annoying to levin it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years the racks as he ascertained being not wanted in winter had been carried to the cart horses stable and there broken as they were of light construction only meant for foddering calves moreover it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters had not been put into repair and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field levin sent for his bailiff but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff beaming all over like everything that day in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan came out of the barn twisting a bit of straw in his hands 
 why the carpenter at the threshing machine 
 oh i meant to tell you yesterday the harrows want repairing here time they got to work in the fields 
 but what were they doing in the winter then 
 but what did you want the carpenter for 
 where are the racks for the calves paddock 
 i ordered them to be got ready what would you have with those people said the bailiff with a wave of his hand 
 not those people but this bailiff said levin getting angry why what do i keep you for he cried but bethinking himself that this would not help matters he stopped short in the middle of a sentence and merely sighed well what do you say can sowing begin he asked after a pause 
 behind turkino tomorrow or next day they might begin 
 and the clover 
 sent vassilii and mishka sowing it only i know if manage to get through so slushy 
 how many dessiatinas 
 six 
 why not sow all cried levin 
 that they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas not in all the twenty was still more annoying to him clover as he knew both from books and from his own experience never did well except when it was sown as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this done 
 no one to send what would you do with such people three turned up and semion 
 well you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter 
 and so i have as it is 
 where are the peasants then 
 five are making compote which meant compost and four are shifting the oats for fear of being touched konstantin dmitrich 
 levin knew very well that touching meant that his english seed oats were already spoiled again they had not done as he had ordered 
 why but i told you during lent to put in pipes he cried 
 be put out we shall get it all done in time 
 levin made an angry gesture and went into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats were not yet spoiled but the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary and arranging for this to be done and taking two laborers from there for sowing clover levin got over the vexation his bailiff had caused him indeed it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry 
 ignat he called to the coachman who with his sleeves tucked up was washing the carriage wheels saddle 
 which sir 
 well let it be kolpik 
 yes sir 
 while they were saddling his horse levin again called the bailiff who was hanging about in sight to make it up with him and began talking to him about the spring operations before them and his plans for the farming 
 the wagons were to begin carting manure earlier so as to get all done before the early mowing and the plowing of the outlying land was to go on without a break so as to let it lie black fallow and furrowed and the moving to be all done by hired labor not on 
 the bailiff listened attentively and obviously made an effort to approve of his projects but still he had that look levin knew so well that always irritated him a look of hopelessness and despondency that look said all very well but as god wills 
 nothing mortified levin so much as that tone but it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had they had all taken that attitude to his plans and so now he was not angered by it but mortified and felt all the more roused to struggle against this apparently elemental force continually ranged against him for which he could find no other name than as god wills 
 if we can manage it konstantin dmitrich said the bailiff 
 why you manage it 
 we positively must have fifteen laborers more and they turn up there were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer 
 levin was silent again he was brought face to face with that opposing force he knew that however much they tried they could not hire more than forty perhaps or laborers for a reasonable sum some forty had been taken on and there were no more but still he could not help struggling against it 
 send to sury to chefirovka if they come we must look for them 
 send to be sure said vassilii fiodorovich despondently but then there are the horses not good for much 
 get some more i know of course levin added laughing you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as possible but this year not going to let you have things your own way see to everything myself 
 why i think you take much rest as it is it cheers us up to work under the eye 
 so sowing clover behind the birch dale go and have a look at them he said mounting the little bay cob kolpik who was led up by the coachman 
 you get across the stream konstantin dmitrich the coachman shouted 
 all right go by the forest 
 and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity ambling easily snorting over the pools and asking as it were for guidance 
 if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open country swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he rode through his forest over the crumbling wasted snow still left in parts and covered with dissolving tracks he rejoiced over every tree with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots when he came out of the forest in the immense plain before him his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horse and colt trampling down his young grass he told a peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he met on the way and asked well ipat shall we soon be sowing we must get the plowing done first konstantin dmitrich answered ipat the farther he rode the happier he became and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders so that the snow should not lie under them to divide them up into six fields of tillage and three for pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land and then three hundred dessiatinas of wheat one hundred of potatoes and one hundred and fifty of clover and not a dessiatina exhausted

 as he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house 
 yes someone from the railway station he thought just the time to be here from the moscow train who could it be what if brother nikolai he did say i may go to the waters or i may come down to you he felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute that his brother presence should come to his happy mood of spring but he felt ashamed of the feeling and at once he opened as it were the arms of his soul and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation he now hoped with all his heart that it was his brother he spurred on his horse and as he rode out from behind the acacias he saw a hired troika from the railway station and a gentleman in a fur coat it was not his brother oh if it were only some pleasant person one could talk to a little he thought 
 ah cried levin joyfully flinging up both his hands a delightful visitor ah how glad i am to see you he shouted recognizing stepan arkadyevich 
 i shall find out for certain whether married or when going to be married he thought 
 and on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all 
 expect me did you said stepan arkadyevich getting out of the sleigh splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose on his cheek and on his eyebrows but radiant with health and good spirits come primarily to see you he said embracing and kissing him secondly to have some stand shooting and thirdly to sell the forest at ergushovo 
 delightful what a spring having how ever did you get along in a sleigh 
 in a wagon it would have been worse still konstantin dmitrievich answered the driver who knew him 
 well very very glad to see you said levin with a genuine smile of childlike delight 
 levin led his friend to the guest room where stepan things were also carried a bag a gun in a case a satchel for cigars leaving him there to wash and change his clothes levin went off to the countinghouse to speak about the plowing and the clover agathya mikhailovna always very anxious for the credit of the house met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner 
 do just as you like only let it be as soon as possible he said and went to the bailiff 
 when he came back stepan arkadyevich washed and combed came out of his room with a beaming smile and they went upstairs together 
 well i am glad i managed to get away to you now i shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here no really i envy you what a house how splendid it all is so bright so cheerful said stepan arkadyevich forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather as on this day and your old nurse is simply charming a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable perhaps but for your severe monastic style it does very well 
 stepan arkadyevich imparted to him many interesting bits of news especially interesting to levin was the news that his brother sergei ivanovich was intending to spend the summer with him in the country 
 not one word did stepan arkadyevich say in reference to kitty and the shcherbatskys he merely gave him greetings from his wife levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and rejoiced exceedingly over his guest as always happened with him during his solitude a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him which he could not communicate to those about him and now he poured out upon stepan arkadyevich his poetic joy over the spring and his failures and plans for the land and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading and the idea of his own book the basis of which really was though he was unaware of it himself a criticism of all the old books on agriculture stepan arkadyevich always charming understanding everything at the slightest reference was particularly charming on this visit and levin noticed in him a special tenderness as it were and a new tone of respect that flattered him 
 the efforts of agathya mikhailovna and the cook to have the dinner particularly good only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course eating a great deal of bread and butter salt goose and salted mushrooms and in finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little patties with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevich was accustomed to very different dinners he thought everything excellent the herb brandy and the bread and the butter and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms and the nettle soup and the chicken in white sauce and the white crimean wine everything was excellent and marvelous 
 splendid splendid he said lighting a fat cigar after the roast i feel as if coming to you i had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer and so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture of course an ignorant outsider but i should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too 
 yes but wait a bit not talking of political economy talking of the science of agriculture it ought to be like the natural sciences and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic ethnographical 
 at that instant agathya mikhailovna came in with jam 
 oh agathya fiodorovna said stepan arkadyevich kissing the tips of his plump fingers what salt goose what herb brandy what do you think it time to start kostia he added 
 levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare treetops of the forest 
 yes time he said kouzma get ready the wide droshky and he ran downstairs 
 stepan arkadyevich going down carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands and opening it began to get ready his expensive gun kouzma who already scented a big tip never left stepan side and put on him both his stockings and boots a task which stepan arkadyevich readily left to him 
 kostia give orders that if the merchant riabinin comes i told him to come today to be shown in and asked to wait for me 
 why do you mean to say selling the forest to riabinin 
 yes do you know him 
 to be sure i do i have had to do business with him positively and definitively 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed positively and definitively were the favorite words 
 yes wonderfully funny the way he talks she knows where her going he added patting laska who hung about levin whining and licking his hands his boots and his gun 
 the droshky was already at the steps when they went out 
 i told them to bring the droshky round though not far to go or would you rather walk 
 no better drive said stepan arkadyevich getting into the droshky he sat down tucked the rug round him and lighted a cigar how is it you smoke a cigar is a sort of thing not exactly a pleasure but the crown and outward sign of pleasure come this is life how splendid it is this is how i should like to live 
 why who prevents you said levin smiling 
 no a lucky man got everything you like you like horses and you have them dogs you have them shooting you have it farming you have it 
 perhaps because i rejoice in what i have and fret for what i said levin thinking of kitty 
 stepan arkadyevich comprehended looked at him but said nothing 
 levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing with his tact that he dreaded conversation about the shcherbatskys and so saying nothing about them but now levin was longing to find out about that which was tormenting him so yet had not the courage to begin 
 come tell me how things are going with you said levin bethinking himself that it was not good of him to think only of himself 
 stepan eyes sparkled merrily 
 you admit i know that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had ration of bread to your mind a crime but i count life as life without love he said taking question in his own way what am i to do made that way and really one does so little harm to anyone and gives oneself so much pleasure 
 what is there something new then queried levin 
 yes my boy there is there do you see you know the type of women women such as one sees in dreams well these women are sometimes to be met with in reality and these women are terrible woman you know is such a subject that no matter how much you study it always perfectly new 
 well then it would be better not to study it 
 no some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth not in the finding of it 
 levin listened in silence and in spite of all the efforts he made he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women

 the place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reaching the copse levin got out of the droshky and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch he took off his full overcoat fastened his belt again and worked his arms to see if they were free 
 gray old laska who had followed them sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears the sun was setting behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch trees dotted about in the aspen copse stood out clearly with their hanging twigs and their buds swollen almost to bursting 
 from the thickest parts of the copse where the snow still remained came the faint sound of narrow winding streamlets of water running away tiny birds twittered and now and then fluttered from tree to tree 
 in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last leaves stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of grasses 
 imagine one can hear and see the grass growing levin said to himself noticing a wet aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood listened and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listening all alert sometimes at the sea of bare treetops that stretched on the slope below him sometimes at the darkening sky covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with a slow sweep of its wings another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hooted not far off and laska starting stepped cautiously a few steps forward and putting her head on one side began to listen intently beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo twice she uttered her usual call and then became hoarse hurried and broke down 
 imagine the cuckoo already said stepan arkadyevich coming out from behind a bush 
 yes i hear it answered levin reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice which sounded disagreeable to himself now coming 
 stepan figure again went behind the bush and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette 
 tchk tchk came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevich cocking his gun 
 that cry asked oblonsky drawing attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice in play 
 oh you know it a buck hare but enough talking listen here it comes almost shrieked levin cocking his gun 
 they heard a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well known to the sportsman two seconds later another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be heard 
 levin looked about him to right and to left and there just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens he saw the flying bird it was flying straight toward him the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sounded close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen and at the very instant when levin was taking aim behind the bush where oblonsky stood there was a flash of red lightning the bird dropped like an arrow and darted upward again again came the red flash and the sound of a blow and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air the bird paused stopped still an instant and fell with a heavy splash to the slushy ground 
 can i possibly have missed it shouted stepan arkadyevich who could not see for the smoke 
 here it is said levin pointing to laska who with one ear pricked up wagging the tip of her shaggy tail was coming slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and seemingly smiling was bringing the dead bird to her master well glad you were successful said levin who at the same time had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the woodcock 
 it was a bad shot from the right barrel responded stepan arkadyevich loading his gun sh here it comes 
 the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again two woodcocks playing and chasing one another and only whistling not crying flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen there was the report of four shots and like swallows the woodcocks turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight 
 the stand shooting was capital stepan arkadyevich shot two more birds and levin two of which one was not found it began to get dark venus bright and silvery shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees and high up in the east twinkled the red fires of somber arcturus over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again the woodcocks had ceased flying but levin resolved to stay a little longer till venus which he saw below a branch of birch should be above it and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus had risen above the branch and the chariot of the great bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he waited 
 it time to go home said stepan arkadyevich 
 it was quite still now in the copse and not a bird was stirring 
 stay a little while answered levin 
 as you like 
 they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another 
 stiva said levin unexpectedly how is it you tell me whether your married yet or when going to be 
 levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied could affect him but he had never dreamed of the answer which stepan arkadyevich made 
 never thought of being married and thinking of it but very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad positively afraid she may not live 
 what cried levin very ill what is wrong with her how is she 
 while they were speaking laska with ears pricked up was looking upward at the sky and reproachfully at them 
 what a time they have chosen to gab she was thinking there it comes here it is yes sure enough miss it thought laska 
 but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which as it were smote on their ears and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed and two bangs sounded at the very same instant the woodcock flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket bending down the delicate shoots 
 splendid together cried levin and he ran with laska into the thicket to look for the woodcock 
 oh yes what was it that was unpleasant he recollected yes ill well it be helped very sorry he thought 
 found it she a clever girl he said taking the warm bird from mouth and packing it into the almost full gamebag got it stiva he shouted

 on the way home levin asked all the details of illness and of the shcherbatskys plans and though he would have been ashamed to admit it he was pleased at what he heard he was pleased that there was still hope and still more pleased that she who had made him suffer should be suffering so much but when stepan arkadyevich began to speak of the causes of illness and mentioned name levin cut him short 
 i have no right whatever to know family matters and to tell the truth no interest in them either 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a barely perceptible smile catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in face which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before 
 have you quite settled about the forest with riabinin asked levin 
 yes all settled the price is magnificent thousand eight straightaway and the rest in six years been bothering about it for ever so long no one would give more 
 then as good as given away your forest for nothing said levin gloomily 
 how do you mean for nothing said stepan arkadyevich with a smile knowing that nothing would be right in eyes now 
 because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles the dessiatina answered levin 
 oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevich playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we are better at it than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that afraid of this crying off in fact you know not timber forest said stepan arkadyevich hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts but for the most part firewood and it run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina and paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina 
 levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina he says those words without understanding them himself 
 i attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but so positive you know all the lore of the forest difficult have you counted the trees 
 how count the trees said stepan arkadyevich laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper count sands of seas and rays of stars though could some higher power 
 oh well the higher power of riabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your worth five hundred a dessiatina paid down while giving you two hundred by installments so that in fact making him a present of thirty thousand 
 come let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevich piteously why was it none would give it then 
 why because he has an understanding with the merchants bought them off had to do with all of them i know them not merchants you know speculators he look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a worth for twenty kopecks 
 well enough of it out of temper 
 not in the least said levin gloomily as they drove up to the house 
 at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps in the trap sat the chubby tightly belted overseer who served riabinin as coachman riabinin himself was already in the house and met the friends in the hall riabinin was a tall thinnish man with mustache and a projecting chin and prominent eyes he was dressed in a blue coat with buttons below the waist at the back and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf with big galoshes drawn over them he mopped his face with his handkerchief and wrapping himself in his coat which sat extremely well as it was he greeted them with a smile holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevich as though he wanted to catch something 
 so here you are said stepan arkadyevich giving him his hand capital 
 i did not venture to disregard your commands though the road was extremely bad i positively covered the whole way at a walk but i am here on time konstantin dmitrich my respects he turned to levin trying to seize his hand too but levin scowling made as though he did not notice his hand and took out the woodcocks your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray added riabinin looking contemptuously at the woodcocks a great delicacy i suppose and he shook his head disapprovingly as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle 
 would you like to go into my study levin said in french to stepan arkadyevich scowling morosely go into my study you can talk there 
 quite so wherever you please said riabinin with supercilious dignity as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything 
 on entering the study riabinin looked about as it was a habit of his as though seeking a holy image but when he had found it he did not cross himself he scanned the bookcases and bookshelves and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the woodcocks he smiled superciliously and shook his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game either were worth the candle 
 well have you brought the money asked oblonsky sit down 
 oh trouble about the money come to see you to talk it over 
 what is there to talk over but do sit down 
 i mind if i do said riabinin sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his armchair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself you must knock it down a bit prince it would be a sin otherwise as for the money it is ready definitively to the last kopeck as for money down be no hitch there 
 levin who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard was just going out of the door but catching the words he stopped 
 why got the forest for nothing as it is he said he came to me too late or have fixed the price for him 
 riabinin got up and in silence with a smile he looked up at levin 
 konstantin dmitrievich is very close he said with a smile turning to stepan arkadyevich definitively no dealing with him i was bargaining for some wheat of him and a pretty price i offered too 
 why should i give you mine for nothing i pick it up off the ground nor did i steal it either 
 mercy on us nowadays positively no chance at all of stealing with the definitively open courts and everything done in style nowadays no question of stealing we are just talking things over like gentlemen his asking too much for the forest i make both ends meet over it i must ask for a little concession 
 but is the thing settled between you or it if settled useless haggling but if it said levin buy the forest 
 the smile vanished at once from face a hawklike greedy cruel expression was left upon it with rapid bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat revealing a large shirt bronze waistcoat buttons and a watch chain and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook 
 here you are the forest is mine he said crossing himself quickly and holding out his hand take the money my forest way of doing business he haggle over every copper he added scowling and waving the pocketbook 
 i be in a hurry if i were you said levin 
 come really said oblonsky in surprise given my word you know 
 levin went out of the room slamming the door riabinin looked toward the door and shook his head with a smile 
 all youthfulness definitively nothing but childishness why buying it upon my honor simply believe me for the glory of it that riabinin and no one else should have bought the copse of oblonsky and as to the profits why i must make what god gives my witness if you would kindly sign the title deed 
 within an hour the merchant carefully stroking his wrapper down and hooking up his coat with the agreement in his pocket seated himself in his tightly covered trap and drove homeward 
 ugh these gentlefolk he said to the overseer they are all made alike a fine lot 
 so responded the overseer handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron but can i congratulate you on the purchase mikhail ignatich 
 well well

 oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevich playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we are better at it than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that afraid of this crying off in fact you know not timber forest said stepan arkadyevich hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts but for the most part firewood and it run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina and paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina 
 levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina he says those words without understanding them himself 
 i attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but so positive you know all the lore of the forest difficult have you counted the trees 
 how count the trees said stepan arkadyevich laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper count sands of seas and rays of stars though could some higher power 
 oh well the higher power of riabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your worth five hundred a dessiatina paid down while giving you two hundred by installments so that in fact making him a present of thirty thousand 
 come let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevich piteously why was it none would give it then 
 why because he has an understanding with the merchants bought them off had to do with all of them i know them not merchants you know speculators he look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a worth for twenty kopecks 
 well enough of it out of temper 
 not in the least said levin gloomily as they drove up to the house 
 at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps in the trap sat the chubby tightly belted overseer who served riabinin as coachman riabinin himself was already in the house and met the friends in the hall riabinin was a tall thinnish man with mustache and a projecting chin and prominent eyes he was dressed in a blue coat with buttons below the waist at the back and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf with big galoshes drawn over them he mopped his face with his handkerchief and wrapping himself in his coat which sat extremely well as it was he greeted them with a smile holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevich as though he wanted to catch something 
 so here you are said stepan arkadyevich giving him his hand capital 
 i did not venture to disregard your commands though the road was extremely bad i positively covered the whole way at a walk but i am here on time konstantin dmitrich my respects he turned to levin trying to seize his hand too but levin scowling made as though he did not notice his hand and took out the woodcocks your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray added riabinin looking contemptuously at the woodcocks a great delicacy i suppose and he shook his head disapprovingly as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle 
 would you like to go into my study levin said in french to stepan arkadyevich scowling morosely go into my study you can talk there 
 quite so wherever you please said riabinin with supercilious dignity as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything 
 on entering the study riabinin looked about as it was a habit of his as though seeking a holy image but when he had found it he did not cross himself he scanned the bookcases and bookshelves and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the woodcocks he smiled superciliously and shook his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game either were worth the candle 
 well have you brought the money asked oblonsky sit down 
 oh trouble about the money come to see you to talk it over 
 what is there to talk over but do sit down 
 i mind if i do said riabinin sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his armchair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself you must knock it down a bit prince it would be a sin otherwise as for the money it is ready definitively to the last kopeck as for money down be no hitch there 
 levin who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard was just going out of the door but catching the words he stopped 
 why got the forest for nothing as it is he said he came to me too late or have fixed the price for him 
 riabinin got up and in silence with a smile he looked up at levin 
 konstantin dmitrievich is very close he said with a smile turning to stepan arkadyevich definitively no dealing with him i was bargaining for some wheat of him and a pretty price i offered too 
 why should i give you mine for nothing i pick it up off the ground nor did i steal it either 
 mercy on us nowadays positively no chance at all of stealing with the definitively open courts and everything done in style nowadays no question of stealing we are just talking things over like gentlemen his asking too much for the forest i make both ends meet over it i must ask for a little concession 
 but is the thing settled between you or it if settled useless haggling but if it said levin buy the forest 
 the smile vanished at once from face a hawklike greedy cruel expression was left upon it with rapid bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat revealing a large shirt bronze waistcoat buttons and a watch chain and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook 
 here you are the forest is mine he said crossing himself quickly and holding out his hand take the money my forest way of doing business he haggle over every copper he added scowling and waving the pocketbook 
 i be in a hurry if i were you said levin 
 come really said oblonsky in surprise given my word you know 
 levin went out of the room slamming the door riabinin looked toward the door and shook his head with a smile 
 all youthfulness definitively nothing but childishness why buying it upon my honor simply believe me for the glory of it that riabinin and no one else should have bought the copse of oblonsky and as to the profits why i must make what god gives my witness if you would kindly sign the title deed 
 within an hour the merchant carefully stroking his wrapper down and hooking up his coat with the agreement in his pocket seated himself in his tightly covered trap and drove homeward 
 ugh these gentlefolk he said to the overseer they are all made alike a fine lot 
 so responded the overseer handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron but can i congratulate you on the purchase mikhail ignatich 
 well well

 stepan arkadyevich went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance the business of the forest was over the money in his pocket their shooting had been excellent and stepan arkadyevich was in the happiest frame of mind and therefore felt especially anxious to dissipate the that had come upon levin he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun 
 levin certainly was out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming guest he could not control his mood the aftereffects of the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him 
 kitty was not married and was ill and ill from love for a man who had slighted her this offense as it were rebounded upon him vronsky had slighted her and she had slighted him levin consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin and therefore he was his enemy but all this levin did not think of he vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him but he fell foul of everything that presented itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practised upon oblonsky and concluded in his house exasperated him 
 well finished he said meeting stepan arkadyevich upstairs would you like supper 
 well i say no to it what an appetite i get in the country wonderful why you offer riabinin something 
 oh damn him 
 still how you do treat him said oblonsky you even shake hands with him why not shake hands with him 
 because i shake hands with a waiter and a a hundred times better than he is 
 what a reactionist you are really what about the amalgamation of classes said oblonsky 
 anyone who likes it is welcome to it but it sickens me 
 a downright reactionist i see 
 really i have never considered what i am i am konstantin levin and nothing else 
 and konstantin levin very much out of temper said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes i am out of temper and do you know why because excuse me of your stupid sale 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own 
 come enough about that he said when did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale it was worth much more but when one wants to sell no one will give anything no i see a grudge against that unlucky riabinin 
 maybe i have and do you know why say again that a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which i belong and in spite of the amalgamation of classes glad to belong and their impoverishment is not due to living in luxury that would be nothing living in good style the proper thing for noblemen only the nobles who know how to do it now the peasants about us buy land and i mind that the gentleman does nothing while the peasant works and supplants the idle man as it should be and i welcome the peasant but i do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of i know what to call it innocence here a polish lessee bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a lady who lives in nice and there a merchant leases land worth ten roubles in rent the dessiatina for one rouble here for no kind of reason made that cheat a present of thirty thousand roubles 
 well what should i have done counted every tree 
 of course they must be counted you count them but riabinin did children will have means of livelihood and education while yours like as not 
 well you must excuse me but something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the done and an end of it and here come some fried eggs my favorite dish and agathya mikhailovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy 
 stepan arkadyevich sat down at the table and began jollying agathya mikhailovna assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper 
 well you praise it at any rate said agathya mikhailovna but konstantin dmitrievich no matter what you give him even a crust of bread will just eat it and walk away 
 though levin tried to control himself he was gloomy and silent he wanted to put one question to stepan arkadyevich but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevich had gone down to his room undressed again washed and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills had got into bed but levin still lingered in his room talking of various trifling matters and not daring to ask what he wanted to know 
 how wonderfully they make the soap he said gazing at a piece of soap he was unwrapping which agathya mikhailovna had placed in readiness for the guest but a brand which oblonsky did not use just look why a work of art 
 yes brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays said stepan arkadyevich with a moist and blissful yawn the theater for instance and the entertainments he yawned the electric light everywhere 
 yes the electric light said levin yes oh and vronsky now he asked suddenly laying down the soap 
 vronsky said stepan arkadyevich checking his yawn in peterburg he left soon after you did and been once in moscow since and do you know kostia tell you the truth he went on leaning his elbow on the table and with his hand propping up his handsome ruddy face in which his humid sleepy eyes shone like stars your own fault you took fright at the sight of your rival but as i told you at the time i say which had the better chance why you fight it out i told you at the time that he yawned inwardly without opening his mouth 
 does he know or he that i did propose levin wondered gazing at him yes something humbugging something diplomatic in his face and feeling he was blushing he looked stepan arkadyevich straight in the face without speaking 
 if there was anything on her side at that time it was nothing but a superficial attraction pursued oblonsky his being such a perfect aristocrat you know and his future position in society had an influence not with her but with her mother 
 levin scowled the humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received but he was at home and the walls of home are a support 
 wait wait he began interrupting oblonsky you talk of his being an aristocrat but allow me to ask what it consists of that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which i can be looked down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but i a man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother god knows whom she mixed up with no excuse me but i consider myself aristocratic and people like me who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family of the highest degree of breeding talent and intellect of course are another matter and have never curried favor with anyone never depended on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and i know many such you think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest while you make riabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get from the government your liferent and i know what while i shall not and so i prize come to me from my ancestors or has been won by hard work we are aristocrats and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful ones of this earth and who can be bought for twenty kopecks 
 well but whom are you attacking i agree with you said stepan arkadyevich sincerely and genially though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twenty kopecks levin was reckoning him as well animation gave him genuine pleasure whom are you attacking a good deal of what you say is not true about vronsky of course but i talk about that i tell you straight out if i were you i should go back with me to moscow and 
 no i know whether you know it or not but i care and i tell you i did propose and was rejected and katerina alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence 
 why what nonsense 
 but we talk about it please forgive me if been nasty said levin now that he had opened his heart he became as he had been in the morning not angry with me stiva please be angry he said and smiling he took his hand 
 of course not not a bit nor is there any reason to be glad spoken openly and do you know stand shooting in the morning is usually good why not go i might go without sleeping straight from shooting to the station

 although all inner life was absorbed in his passion his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests the interests of his regiment took an important place in life both because he was fond of the regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him they were not only fond of vronsky in his regiment they respected him too and were proud of him proud that this man with his immense wealth his brilliant education and abilities and the path open before him to every kind of success distinction and ambition had disregarded all that and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart vronsky was aware of his comrades view of him and in addition to his liking for that sort of life he felt bound to keep up that reputation 
 it need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself and he closed the mouths of any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his liaison but in spite of that his love was known to all the town everyone guessed with more or less certainty at his relations with madame karenina the majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted position of karenin and the consequent transparency to society of their liaison 
 the greater number of the young women who envied anna and had long been weary of having her called righteous rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn they were already making ready their handfuls of mud to cast at her when the right moment arrived the greater number of the people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society 
 mother on hearing of his liaison was at first pleased by it because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society she was pleased too that madame karenina who had so taken her fancy and had talked so much of her son was after all just like all the other pretty and decent women according to the countess ideas but she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career simply in order to remain in the regiment where could be constantly seeing madame karenina she heard that great personages were displeased with him on this account and she changed her opinion she was vexed too that from all she could learn of this liaison it was not that brilliant graceful worldly liaison which she would have welcomed but a sort of desperate passion so she was told which might well lead him into follies she had not seen him since his abrupt departure from moscow and she sent her elder son to bid him to come to her 
 this elder brother too was displeased with his younger brother he did not distinguish what sort of love his might be big or little passionate or passionless pure or impure he kept a ballet girl himself though he was the father of a family so he was rather indulgent but he knew that this love displeased those whom it was necessary to please and therefore he did not approve of his conduct 
 besides the service and society vronsky had another great interest horses he was passionately fond of horses 
 that year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers vronsky had put his name down bought a thoroughbred english mare and in spite of his love he was looking forward to the races with intense though reserved excitement 
 these two passions did not interfere with one another on the contrary he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him

 on the day of the races at krasnoe selo vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment he had no need to be strict with himself as his weight was exactly the required one but still he had to avoid gaining flesh and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes he sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat resting both elbows on the table and while waiting for the steak he had ordered was looking over a french novel that lay open on his plate he was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out he was thinking 
 he was thinking of promise to see him today after the races but he had not seen her for three days and as her husband had just returned from abroad he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not and he did not know how to find out he had had his last interview with her at his cousin summer villa he visited the summer villa of the karenins as rarely as possible now he wanted to go there and he pondered the question of how to do it 
 of course i shall say betsy has sent me to ask whether coming to the races of course go he decided lifting his head from the book and as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her his face lighted up 
 send to my house and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quickly as they can he said to the servant who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish and moving the dish up toward him he began eating 
 from the adjoining billiard room came the sound of balls clicking of talk and laughter two officers appeared at the entrance door one a young fellow with a weak delicate face who had lately joined the regiment from the corps of pages the other a plump elderly officer with a bracelet on his wrist and little eyes lost in fat 
 vronsky glanced at them frowned and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them he proceeded to eat and read at the same time 
 what fortifying yourself for your work said the plump officer sitting down beside him 
 as you see responded vronsky knitting his brows wiping his mouth and without looking at the officer 
 so not afraid of getting fat said the latter turning a chair round for the young officer 
 what said vronsky angrily making a wry face of disgust and showing his heavy teeth 
 not afraid of getting fat 
 waiter sherry said vronsky without replying and moving the book to the other side of him he went on reading 
 the plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer 
 you choose what to drink he said handing him the card and looking at him 
 rhine wine please said the young officer stealing a timid glance at vronsky and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache seeing that vronsky did not turn round the young officer got up 
 go into the billiard room he said 
 the plump officer rose submissively and they moved toward the door 
 at that moment there walked into the room the tan and captain iashvin nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers he went up to vronsky 
 ah here he is he cried bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet vronsky looked round angrily but his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of calm and firm friendliness 
 it aliosha said the captain in his loud baritone have a bite and drink one tiny glass 
 oh not very hungry 
 there go the inseparables iashvin dropped glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room and he bent his long legs swathed in tight riding breeches and sat down in the chair too low for him so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle why you turn up at theater at krasnoe selo yesterday numerova at all bad where were you

 ah responded iashvin 
 iashvin a gambler and a rake a man not merely without any principles but of immoral principles iashvin was greatest friend in the regiment vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish and to do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it and for his great strength of character which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers commanding both fear and respect and also at cards when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the english club vronsky respected and liked iashvin particularly because he felt iashvin liked him not for his name and his money but for himself and of all men he was the only one with whom vronsky would have liked to speak of his love he felt that iashvin in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling was the only man who could so he fancied comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life moreover he felt certain that iashvin as it was took no delight in gossip and scandal and interpreted his feeling rightly that is to say knew and believed that this passion was not a joke not a pastime but something more serious and important 
 vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion but he was aware that he knew all about it and that he put the right interpretation on it and he was glad to see this in his eyes 
 ah yes he said to the announcement that vronsky had been at the tverskys and his black eyes shining he plucked at his left mustache and began twisting it into his mouth a bad habit he had

 on the day of the races at krasnoe selo vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment he had no need to be strict with himself as his weight was exactly the required one but still he had to avoid gaining flesh and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes he sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat resting both elbows on the table and while waiting for the steak he had ordered was looking over a french novel that lay open on his plate he was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out he was thinking 
 he was thinking of promise to see him today after the races but he had not seen her for three days and as her husband had just returned from abroad he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not and he did not know how to find out he had had his last interview with her at his cousin summer villa he visited the summer villa of the karenins as rarely as possible now he wanted to go there and he pondered the question of how to do it 
 of course i shall say betsy has sent me to ask whether coming to the races of course go he decided lifting his head from the book and as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her his face lighted up 
 send to my house and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quickly as they can he said to the servant who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish and moving the dish up toward him he began eating 
 from the adjoining billiard room came the sound of balls clicking of talk and laughter two officers appeared at the entrance door one a young fellow with a weak delicate face who had lately joined the regiment from the corps of pages the other a plump elderly officer with a bracelet on his wrist and little eyes lost in fat 
 vronsky glanced at them frowned and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them he proceeded to eat and read at the same time 
 what fortifying yourself for your work said the plump officer sitting down beside him 
 as you see responded vronsky knitting his brows wiping his mouth and without looking at the officer 
 so not afraid of getting fat said the latter turning a chair round for the young officer 
 what said vronsky angrily making a wry face of disgust and showing his heavy teeth 
 not afraid of getting fat 
 waiter sherry said vronsky without replying and moving the book to the other side of him he went on reading 
 the plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer 
 you choose what to drink he said handing him the card and looking at him 
 rhine wine please said the young officer stealing a timid glance at vronsky and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache seeing that vronsky did not turn round the young officer got up 
 go into the billiard room he said 
 the plump officer rose submissively and they moved toward the door 
 at that moment there walked into the room the tan and captain iashvin nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers he went up to vronsky 
 ah here he is he cried bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet vronsky looked round angrily but his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of calm and firm friendliness 
 it aliosha said the captain in his loud baritone have a bite and drink one tiny glass 
 oh not very hungry 
 there go the inseparables iashvin dropped glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room and he bent his long legs swathed in tight riding breeches and sat down in the chair too low for him so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle why you turn up at theater at krasnoe selo yesterday numerova at all bad where were you 
 i was late at the tverskys said vronsky

 where are you off to asked iashvin oh here is your troika he added seeing the carriage drive up 
 to the stables and got to see briansky too about the horses said vronsky 
 vronsky had as a fact promised to call at some ten verstas from peterhof and to bring him money owing for some horses and he hoped to have time to get that in too but his comrades were at once aware that that was not the only place he was going 
 petritsky still humming winked and made a pout with his lips as though he would say oh yes we know your briansky 
 mind not late was only comment and to change the conversation my roan is he doing all right he inquired looking out of the window at the shaft horse which he had sold to vronsky

 quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers

 the temporary stable a wooden booth had been put up close to the racecourse and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day he had not yet seen her there during the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself but had put her in the charge of the trainer and so now he absolutely did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday or was in today he had scarcely got out of his carriage when his stableboy groom recognizing the carriage some way off called the trainer a englishman in high boots and a short jacket except for a tuft below his chin came to meet him walking with the uncouth gait of a jockey turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side 
 well vronsky asked in english 
 all right sir the voice responded somewhere far down in his throat better not go in he added touching his hat put a muzzle on her and the fidgety better not go in excite the mare 
 no going in i want to look at her 
 come along then said the englishman frowning and speaking with his mouth shut and with swinging elbows he went on in front with his disjointed gait 
 they went into the little yard in front of the shed the stableboy on duty spruce and smart in his holiday attire met them with a broom in his hand and followed them in the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls and vronsky knew that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse had been brought there and must be standing among them even more than his mare vronsky longed to see gladiator whom he had never seen but vronsky knew that by the etiquette of the racecourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse but improper even to ask questions about him just as he was passing along the passage the boy opened the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs he knew that this was gladiator but with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another open letter he turned round and went into stall 
 the stall belonging to mak i never can say the name is here said the englishman over his shoulder pointing his thumb toward stall 
 makhotin yes my most serious rival said vronsky 
 if you were riding him said the englishman bet on you 
 more nervous while the other is more powerful said vronsky smiling at the compliment to his riding 
 in a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck said the englishman 
 of pluck that is energy and courage vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough what was of far more importance he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this pluck than he had 
 you think i want more sweating down 
 oh no answered the englishman please speak loud the fidgety he added nodding toward the horse box before which they were standing and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw 
 he opened the door and vronsky went into the horse box dimly lighted by one little window in the horse box stood a dark bay mare with a muzzle on shifting her feet on the fresh straw looking round him in the twilight of the horse box vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare was an animal of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a point of view she was all over though her chest was extremely prominent in front it was narrow her hindquarters were a little drooping and in her forelegs and still more in her hind legs there was a noticeable curvature the muscles of both hind legs and forelegs were not very thick but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side she looked altogether except across the shoulders apparently pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten that quality was blood the blood that tells as the english expression has it the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews covered with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they were hard as bone her head with prominent bright spirited eyes broadened out at the open nostrils that showed the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there was a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she was one of those creatures which seem devoid of speech only because the mechanism of their mouths does not allow of it 
 to vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment as he looked at her 
 directly vronsky went toward her she drew in a deep breath and turning back her prominent eye tin the white looked bloodshot she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side shaking her muzzle and shifting lightly from one leg to the other 
 there you see how fidgety she is said the englishman 
 whoa darling whoa said vronsky going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her 
 but the nearer he came the more excited she grew only when he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter while the muscles quivered under her soft delicate coat vronsky patted her strong neck straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side and moved his face near her dilated nostrils transparent as a wing she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils started pricked up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip toward vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remembering the muzzle she shook it and again began restlessly stamping her shapely legs one after the other 
 calm down darling calm down he said patting her again over her hindquarters and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition he went out of the horse box 
 the excitement had infected vronsky he felt that his heart was throbbing and that he too like the mare longed to move to bite it was both fearful and delicious 
 well i rely on you then he said to the englishman six on the ground 
 all right said the englishman oh where are you going my lord he asked suddenly using the title my lord which he scarcely ever used 
 vronsky in amazement raised his head and stared as he knew how to stare not into the eyes but at his forehead astounded at the impertinence of his question but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer but as a jockey he answered 
 got to go to i shall be home within an hour 
 how often asked that question today he said to himself and he blushed a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him and as though he too knew where vronsky was going he added 
 the great thing is to keep quiet before a race said he get out of temper or upset about anything 
 all right answered vronsky smiling and jumping into his carriage he told the man to drive to peterhof 
 before he had driven many paces away the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke and there was a heavy downpour of rain 
 what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his letter and his note and read them through 
 yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer to me than life and this is incomprehensible and why it annoys them whatever our destiny is or may be we have made it ourselves and we do not complain of it he said in the word we linking himself with anna no they must needs teach us how to live they an idea of what happiness is they know that without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all he thought 
 he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they all these people were right he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigues do pass leaving no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant memories he felt all the torture of his own position and hers all the difficulty in store for them conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world in concealing their love in lying and deceiving and in lying deceiving feigning and continually thinking of others when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love 
 he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which were so against his natural bent he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his relations with anna this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexei alexandrovich or for himself or for the whole world he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling now too he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts 
 yes she was unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she does not show it yes we must put an end to it he decided 
 and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position and the sooner the better abandon everything must we she and i and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love he said to himself

 what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his letter and his note and read them through 
 yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer to me than life and this is incomprehensible and why it annoys them whatever our destiny is or may be we have made it ourselves and we do not complain of it he said in the word we linking himself with anna no they must needs teach us how to live they an idea of what happiness is they know that without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all he thought 
 he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they all these people were right he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigues do pass leaving no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant memories he felt all the torture of his own position and hers all the difficulty in store for them conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world in concealing their love in lying and deceiving and in lying deceiving feigning and continually thinking of others when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love 
 he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which were so against his natural bent he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his relations with anna this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexei alexandrovich or for himself or for the whole world he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling now too he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts 
 yes she was unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she does not show it yes we must put an end to it he decided 
 and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position and the sooner the better abandon everything must we she and i and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love he said to himself

 the shower did not last long and by the time vronsky arrived his shaft horse trotting at full speed and dragging the off horses galloping through the mud with their reins hanging loose the sun had peeped out again the roofs of the summer villas and the old lime trees in the gardens on both sides of the high street sparkled with wet brilliance and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water he thought no more of shower spoiling the racecourse but was now rejoicing because thanks to the rain he would be sure to find her at home and alone as he knew that alexei alexandrovich who had lately returned from a watering place had not moved from peterburg 
 hoping to find her alone vronsky alighted as he always did to avoid attracting attention before crossing the bridge and walked to the house he did not go up the steps to the street door but went into the court 
 has your master come he asked a gardener 
 no sir the mistress is at home but will you please go to the front door there are servants there the gardener answered open the door 
 no go in from the garden 
 and feeling satisfied that she was alone and wanting to take her by surprise since he had not promised to be there today and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races he walked holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path bordered with flowers to the terrace that looked out upon the garden vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of his position he thought of nothing but that he would see her directly not in imagination but living all of her as she was in reality he was just going in stepping on his whole foot so as not to make a noise up the worn steps of the terrace when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her her son with his questioning and as he fancied hostile eyes 
 this boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom when he was present both vronsky and anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand they had made no agreement about this it had been settled of itself they would have felt it as wounding themselves to deceive the child in his presence they talked like acquaintances but in spite of this caution vronsky often saw the intent bewildered glance fixed upon him and a strange shyness uncertainty at one time there was friendliness at another coldness and reserve in the manner to him as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond the significance of which he could not understand 
 as a matter of fact the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation and he tried painfully yet was unable to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he saw distinctly that his father his governess his nurse all not merely disliked vronsky but looked on him with horror and aversion though they never said anything about him while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend 
 what does it mean who is he how ought i to love him if i know my fault either stupid or a naughty boy thought the child and this was what caused his dubious inquiring sometimes hostile expression and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky found so irksome this presence always and infallibly called up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late this presence called up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one but that to arrest his motion is not in his power that every instant is carrying him farther and farther away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is tantamount to admitting his certain ruin 
 this child with his innocent outlook upon life was the compass that showed them the point at which they had departed from what they knew yet did not want to know 
 this time seriozha was not at home and she was completely alone she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son who had gone out for a stroll and had been caught in the rain she had sent out a manservant and a maid to look for him and was sitting here waiting for them dressed in a white gown deeply embroidered she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers and did not hear him bending her curly dark head she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet and both her lovely hands with the rings he knew so well clasped the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hands struck vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stood still gazing at her in ecstasy but directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her she was aware of his presence pushed away the watering pot and turned her flushed face toward him 
 the matter are you unwell he said to her in french going up to her he would have run to her but remembering that there might be outsiders he looked round toward the balcony door and reddened as he always reddened feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard 
 no quite well she said getting up and squeezing his outstretched hand tightly i did not expect thee 
 my god what cold hands he said 
 you startled me she said alone and expecting seriozha out for a walk come from this direction 
 but in spite of her efforts to be calm her lips were quivering 
 forgive me for coming but i pass the day without seeing you he went on speaking french as he always did to avoid using the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between them and the dangerously intimate singular 
 forgive for what so glad 
 but ill or worried he went on without letting go her hands and bending over her what were you thinking of 
 always of the same thing she said with a smile 
 she spoke the truth if ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of she could have answered truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she was thinking just when he came upon her of this why was it she wondered that to others to betsy for instance she knew of her secret connection with tushkevich all this was so easy while to her it was such torture today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations she asked him about the races he answered her questions and seeing that she was agitated trying to calm her he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races 
 shall i tell him or not she thought looking into his calm affable eyes he is so happy so absorbed in his races that he understand as he should he understand all the significance of this event to us 
 but you told me what you were thinking of when i came in he said interrupting his narrative pray tell me 
 she did not answer and bending her head a little she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows her eyes shining under their long lashes her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked he saw it and his face expressed that utter subjection that slavish devotion which had done so much to win her 
 i see something has happened do you suppose i can be at peace knowing you have a trouble i am not sharing tell me for sake he repeated imploringly 
 yes i be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the significance of it better not tell why put him to the proof she thought still staring at him in the same way and feeling that her hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more 
 for sake he repeated taking her hand 
 shall i tell you 
 yes yes yes 
 i am pregnant she said softly and slowly 
 the leaf in her hand shook more violently but she did not take her eyes off him watching how he would take it he turned pale would have said something but stopped he dropped her hand and his head sank on his breast yes he realizes all the significance of the fact she thought and gratefully she pressed his hand 
 but she was mistaken in thinking he realized the significance of the news as she a woman realized it on hearing it he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he realized that the turning point he had been longing for had come now that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affected him in the same way he looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness kissed her hand got up and in silence paced up and down the terrace 
 yes he said going up to her resolutely neither you nor i have looked on our relations as a passing amusement and now our fate is sealed it is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he spoke to the deception in which we are living 
 put an end put an end how alexei she said softly 
 she was calmer now and her face lighted up with a tender smile 
 leave your husband and make our life one 
 it is one as it is she answered scarcely audibly 
 yes but completely completely 
 but how alexei tell me how she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own situation is there any way out of such a situation am i not the wife of my husband 
 there is a way out of every situation we must take our stand he said better than the situation in which living of course i see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband 
 oh not over my husband she said with a plain smile i know him i think of him he exist 
 not speaking sincerely i know you you worry about him too 
 oh he even know she said and suddenly a hot flush came over her face her cheeks her brow her neck crimsoned and tears of shame came into her eyes but let us not even talk of him

 vronsky had several times already though not so resolutely as now tried to bring her to consider her position and every time he had been confronted by the same superficiality and frivolity with which she met his appeal now it was as though there were something in this which she could not or would not face as though directly she began to speak of this she the real anna retreated somehow into herself and another strange and unaccountable woman came out whom he did not love and whom he feared and who was in opposition to him but today he was resolved to have it out 
 whether he knows or not said vronsky in his usual calm and firm tone whether he knows or not has nothing to do with us we cannot you cannot stay like this especially now 
 to be done according to you she asked with the same frivolous irony she who had so feared he would take her condition too frivolously was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step 
 tell him everything and leave him 
 very well let us suppose i do that she said do you know what the result of that would be i can tell you it all beforehand and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes that had been so tender a minute before eh you love another man and have entered into a criminal liaison with him mimicking her husband she threw an emphasis on the word criminal as alexei alexandrovich did i warned you of the results in the religious the civil and the domestic aspects you have not listened to me now i cannot let you disgrace my name and my son she had meant to say but about her son she could not jest disgrace my name and and more in the same style she added in general terms say in his official manner and with all distinctness and precision that he cannot let me go but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal and he will calmly and punctiliously act in accordance with his words what will happen not a man but a machine and a spiteful machine when angry she added recalling alexei alexandrovich as she spoke with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him forgiving him nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him 
 but anna said vronsky in a soft and persuasive voice trying to soothe her we absolutely must tell him at any rate and then be guided by the line he takes 
 what run away 
 and why not run away i see how we can keep on like this and not for my sake i see that you suffer 
 yes run away and become your mistress she said angrily 
 anna he said with reproachful tenderness 
 yes she went on become your mistress and complete the ruin of 
 again she would have said my son but she could not utter that word 
 vronsky could not understand how she with her strong and truthful nature could endure this state of deceit and not long to get out of it but he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word son which she could not utter when she thought of her son and his future attitude to his mother who had abandoned his father she felt such terror at what she had done that she no longer reasoned but being a woman could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances and words so that everything should remain as it always had been and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son 
 i beg you i entreat you she said suddenly taking his hand and speaking in quite a different tone sincere and tender never speak to me of that 
 but anna 
 never leave it to me i know all the baseness all the horror of my position but not so easy to decide as you think therefore leave it to me and do what i say never speak to me of it do you promise me no no promise 
 i promise everything but i be at peace especially after what you have told me i be at peace when you be at peace 
 i she repeated yes i am worried sometimes but that will pass if you will never talk about this when you talk about it only then it worries me 
 i understand he said 
 i know she interrupted him how hard it is for your truthful nature to lie and i grieve for you i often think how could you ruin your whole life for me 
 i was just thinking the very same thing he said how could you sacrifice everything for my sake i forgive myself because unhappy 
 i unhappy she said coming closer to him and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love i am like a hungry man who has been given food he may be cold and dressed in rags and ashamed but he is not unhappy i unhappy no this is my happiness 
 she could hear the sound of her voice coming toward them and glancing swiftly round the terrace she got up impulsively her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well with a rapid movement she raised her lovely hands covered with rings took his head looked into his face with a protracted gaze and putting up her face with smiling parted lips swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes and thrust him away she would have gone but he held her back 
 when he murmured in a whisper gazing in ecstasy at her 
 tonight at one she whispered and with a heavy sigh she walked with her light swift step to meet her son 
 seriozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden and he and his nurse had taken shelter in a bower 
 well au revoir she said to vronsky i must soon be getting ready for the races betsy promised to fetch me

 chapter 
 
 when vronsky had looked at his watch on the karenins balcony he had been so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that although he saw the hands on the face of his watch he could not take in what time it was he came out onto the highroad and walked picking his way carefully through the mud to his carriage he was so completely absorbed in his feeling for anna that he did not even think what it was and whether he had time to go to he preserved as often happens only the external faculty of memory that points out each step one has to take one after the other he went up to his coachman who was dozing on the box in the shadow already lengthening of a thick lime tree he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses and waking the coachman he jumped into the carriage and told him to drive to it was only after driving nearly seven verstas that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch and realize that it was half past five and that he was late 
 there were several races set for that day the body guards race then the officers race then the race and then the race for which he was entered he could still be in right time for his race but if he went to he could be only in full time and he would arrive when the whole court would be in their places that would be a pity but he had promised briansky to come and so he decided to drive on telling the coachman not to spare the horses 
 he reached spent five minutes there and galloped back this rapid drive calmed him all that was painful in his relations with anna all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation had slipped out of his mind he was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race of his being in time after all and now and then the thought of the happiness of this assignation flashed across his imagination like a dazzling light 
 the excitement of the approaching race gained upon him more and more as he drove farther and farther into the atmosphere of the races overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of peterburg 
 there was no longer anyone at home at his quarters all were at the races and his valet was looking out for him at the gate while he was changing his clothes his valet told him that the second race had begun already that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him and a boy had twice run up from the stables 
 dressing without hurry he never hurried himself and never lost his vronsky drove to the sheds from the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages and people on foot soldiers surrounding the racecourse and pavilions swarming with people the second race was apparently going on for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing going toward the stable he met the chestnut gladiator being led to the racecourse in a blue and orange horsecloth with what looked like huge ears edged with blue 
 cord he asked the stableboy 
 in the stable putting on the saddle 
 in the open horse box stood saddled ready they were just going to lead her out 
 not too late 
 all right all right said the englishman upset yourself 
 vronsky once more took in at one glance the beautiful lines of his favorite mare who was quivering all over and with an effort he tore himself from the sight of her and went out of the stable he went toward the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention the race was just finishing and all eyes were fixed on the cavalry guard in front and the light hussar behind urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post from the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post and a group of soldiers and officers of the cavalry guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race and the tall cavalry guard who came in first leaning over the saddle let go the reins of his panting gray stallion that looked dark with sweat 
 the stallion stiffening out his legs with an effort stopped his rapid course and the officer of the cavalry guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep and just managed to smile a crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him 
 vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of upper world which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions he knew that madame karenina was there and betsy and his wife and he purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his attention but he was continually met and stopped by acquaintances who told him about the previous races and kept asking him why he was so late 
 at the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes and all attention was directed to that point elder brother alexandre a colonel with the shoulder knot came up to him he was not tall though as broadly built as alexei and handsomer and rosier than he he had a red nose and an open tipsy face 
 did you get my note he said never any finding you 
 alexandre vronsky in spite of his dissolute life and particularly his drunken habits for which he was notorious was quite one of the court circle 
 now as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him he kept a smiling countenance as though he were jesting with his brother about something of little moment 
 i got it and i really make out what you are worrying yourself about said alexei 
 worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you here and that you were seen in peterhof on monday 
 there are matters which only concern those directly interested in them and the matter you are so worried about is of that nature 
 yes but if so one does not belong in the service one does not 
 i beg you not to meddle and that is all 
 alexei frowning face turned pale and his prominent lower jaw quivered which happened rarely with him being a man of very warm heart he was seldom angry but when he was angry and when his chin quivered then as alexandre vronsky knew he was dangerous alexandre vronsky smiled gaily 
 i only wanted to give you letter answer it and worry about anything just before the race bonne chance he added smiling and he moved away from him but after him another friendly greeting brought vronsky to a standstill 
 so you recognize your friends how are you mon cher said stepan arkadyevich as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the peterburg brilliance as he was in moscow his face rosy and his whiskers sleek and glossy i came up yesterday and delighted because i shall see your triumph when shall we meet 
 come tomorrow to the messroom said vronsky and squeezing him by the sleeve of his greatcoat with apologies he moved away to the center of the racecourse where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase 
 the horses who had run in the last race were being led home steaming and exhausted by the stableboys and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance for the most part english racers wearing horsecloths and looking with their bellies like strange huge birds on the right was led in lean and beautiful lifting up her elastic rather long pasterns as though moved by springs not far from her they were taking the caparison off the gladiator the strong exquisite perfectly correct lines of the stallion with his superb hindquarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his hoofs attracted attention in spite of himself he would have gone up to his mare but he was again detained by an acquaintance 
 oh karenin said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting looking for his wife and in the middle of the pavilion you see her 
 no i answered vronsky and without even glancing round toward the pavilion where his friend was pointing out madame karenina he went up to his mare 
 vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle about which he had to give some direction when the entrants were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting seventeen officers looking serious and severe many with pale faces met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers vronsky drew number the cry was heard mount 
 feeling that with the others riding in the race he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became dilatory and calm in his movements cord in honor of the races had put on his best clothes a black coat buttoned up a stiffly starched collar which propped up his cheeks a black bowler and hessian boots he was calm and dignified as ever and was with his own hands holding by both reins standing straight in front of her was still trembling as though in a fever her eye full of fire glanced sideways at vronsky vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle girth the mare glanced aslant at him drew up her lip and twitched her ear the englishman puckered up his lips intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling 
 get up you feel so excited 
 vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals he knew that he would not see them during the race two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start galtsin a friend of and one of his more formidable rivals was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount a little hussar of the life guards in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop crouched up like a cat over the porridge in imitation of english jockeys prince kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the grabovsky stud while an english groom led her by the bridle vronsky and all his comrades knew kuzovlev and his peculiarity of weak nerves and terrible vanity they knew that he was afraid of everything afraid of riding a line horse but now just because it was terrible because people broke their necks and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle and an ambulance with a cross on it and a sister of mercy he had made up his mind to take part in the race their eyes met and vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod only one he did not see his chief rival makhotin on gladiator 
 be in a hurry said cord to vronsky and remember one thing hold her in at the fences and urge her on let her go as she likes 
 all right all right said vronsky taking the reins 
 if you can lead the race but lose heart till the last minute even if behind 
 before the mare had time to move vronsky stepped with an agile vigorous movement into the stirrup and lightly and firmly placed his compacted body on the creaking leather of the saddle getting his right foot in the stirrup he with habitual moving smoothed the double reins between his fingers and cord let go as though she did not know which foot to put first started dragging at the reins with her long neck and as though she were on springs shaking her rider from side to side cord quickened his step following him the excited mare trying to deceive her rider pulled at the reins first on one side and then the other and vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her 
 they were just reaching the stream on their way to the starting point several of the riders were in front and several behind when suddenly vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the behind him and he was overtaken by makhotin on his gladiator makhotin smiled showing his long teeth but vronsky looked at him angrily he did not like him and regarded him now as his most formidable rival he was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his mare started into a gallop her left foot forward made two bounds and fretting at the tightened reins passed into a jolting trot bumping her rider up and down cord too scowled and followed vronsky almost ambling

 when vronsky had looked at his watch on the karenins balcony he had been so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that although he saw the hands on the face of his watch he could not take in what time it was he came out onto the highroad and walked picking his way carefully through the mud to his carriage he was so completely absorbed in his feeling for anna that he did not even think what it was and whether he had time to go to he preserved as often happens only the external faculty of memory that points out each step one has to take one after the other he went up to his coachman who was dozing on the box in the shadow already lengthening of a thick lime tree he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses and waking the coachman he jumped into the carriage and told him to drive to it was only after driving nearly seven verstas that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch and realize that it was half past five and that he was late 
 there were several races set for that day the body guards race then the officers race then the race and then the race for which he was entered he could still be in right time for his race but if he went to he could be only in full time and he would arrive when the whole court would be in their places that would be a pity but he had promised briansky to come and so he decided to drive on telling the coachman not to spare the horses 
 he reached spent five minutes there and galloped back this rapid drive calmed him all that was painful in his relations with anna all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation had slipped out of his mind he was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race of his being in time after all and now and then the thought of the happiness of this assignation flashed across his imagination like a dazzling light 
 the excitement of the approaching race gained upon him more and more as he drove farther and farther into the atmosphere of the races overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of peterburg 
 there was no longer anyone at home at his quarters all were at the races and his valet was looking out for him at the gate while he was changing his clothes his valet told him that the second race had begun already that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him and a boy had twice run up from the stables 
 dressing without hurry he never hurried himself and never lost his vronsky drove to the sheds from the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages and people on foot soldiers surrounding the racecourse and pavilions swarming with people the second race was apparently going on for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing going toward the stable he met the chestnut gladiator being led to the racecourse in a blue and orange horsecloth with what looked like huge ears edged with blue 
 cord he asked the stableboy 
 in the stable putting on the saddle 
 in the open horse box stood saddled ready they were just going to lead her out 
 not too late 
 all right all right said the englishman upset yourself

 there were seventeen officers in all riding in this race the racecourse was a large ring in the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion on this course nine obstacles had been arranged the stream a big and solid barrier two arsheenes high just before the pavilion a dry ditch a ditch full of water a precipitous slope an irish barricade one of the most difficult obstacles consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or possibly be killed then two more ditches filled with water and one dry one and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion but the race began not in the ring but a hundred arsheenes away from it and in that part of the course was the first obstacle a stream three arsheenes in breadth which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred 
 three times they were ranged ready to start but each time some horse thrust itself out of line and they had to begin again the starter colonel sestrin was beginning to lose his temper when at last for the fourth time he shouted away and the riders started 
 every eye every opera glass was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start 
 off starting was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation 
 and little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view in the very first minute the close group of horsemen spread out and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another to the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them 
 excited and overnervous had lost the first moment and several horses had started before her but before reaching the stream vronsky who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle easily overtook three and there were left in front of him chestnut gladiator whose hindquarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of vronsky and in front of all the dainty mare diana bearing the more dead than alive kuzovlev 
 for the first instant vronsky was not master either of himself or his mare up to the first obstacle the stream he could not guide the motions of his mare 
 gladiator and diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant at a stroke they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side darted after them easily as if flying but at the very moment when vronsky felt himself in the air he suddenly saw almost under his hoofs kuzovlev who was floundering with diana on the further side of the stream kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap and the mare had fallen together with him over her head those details vronsky learned later at the moment all he saw was that just under him where must alight legs or head might be in the way but drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping like a falling cat and clearing the other mare alighted beyond her 
 oh you darling flashed through head 
 after crossing the stream vronsky had complete control of his mare and began holding her in intending to cross the great barrier behind makhotin and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about two hundred sazhenes that followed it 
 the great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion the czar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them at him and at makhotin a length ahead of him as they drew near the devil as the solid barrier was called vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare the ground racing to meet him and the back and white legs of gladiator beating time swiftly before him and keeping always the same distance ahead gladiator rose with no sound of knocking against anything with a wave of his short tail he disappeared from sight 
 bravo cried a voice 
 at the same instant under eyes right before him flashed the palings of the barrier without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it the palings vanished and he heard only a crash behind him the mare excited by keeping ahead had risen too soon before the barrier and grazed it with one of her hind hoofs but her pace never changed and vronsky feeling a spatter of mud in his face realized that he was once more the same distance from gladiator once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away 
 at the very moment when vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake makhotin herself understanding his thoughts without any incitement on his part gained considerably and began getting alongside of makhotin on the most favorable side close to the inner rope makhotin would not let her pass that side vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side when shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side shoulder beginning by now to be dark with sweat was even with back for a few bounds they moved evenly but before the obstacle they were approaching vronsky began working at the reins anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle and swiftly passed makhotin just upon the declivity he caught a glimpse of his face as he flashed by he even fancied that he smiled vronsky passed makhotin but he was immediately aware of him close upon him and he never ceased hearing just behind him the hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of gladiator 
 the next two obstacles the watercourse and the barrier were easily crossed but vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of gladiator closer upon him he urged on his mare and to his delight felt that she easily quickened her pace and the thud of hoofs was again heard at the same distance away 
 vronsky was at the head of the race just as he wanted to be and as cord had advised and now he felt sure of being the winner his excitement his delight and his tenderness for grew keener and keener he longed to look round but he did not dare do this and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so as to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that gladiator still kept there remained only one obstacle the most difficult if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first he was flying toward the irish barricade and he both together saw the barricade in the distance and both the man and the mare had a hesitation he saw the uncertainty in the ears and lifted the whip but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless the mare knew what was wanted she quickened her pace and rose rhythmically just as he had fancied she would and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush which carried her far beyond the ditch and with the same rhythm without effort with the same leg forward fell back into her pace again 
 bravo vronsky he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were his friends and his regiment comrades who were standing at the obstacle he could not fail to recognize voice though he did not see him 
 o my sweet he said inwardly to as he listened for what was happening behind cleared it he thought catching the thud of hoofs behind him there remained only the last ditch filled with water and two arsheenes wide vronsky did not even look at it but anxious to come in a long way ahead began sawing away at the reins lifting the head and letting it go in time with her paces he felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength not her neck and shoulders merely were wet but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane her head her sharp ears and her breath came in short sharp gasps but he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining two hundred sazhenes it was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace she flew over the ditch as though not noticing it she flew over it like a bird but at the same instant vronsky to his horror felt that failing to keep up with the pace he had he did not know how made an abominable unpardonable move in recovering his seat in the saddle all at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened he could not yet make out what had happened when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him and makhotin passed at a swift gallop vronsky was touching the ground with one foot and his mare was sinking on that foot he just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side gasping painfully and making vain efforts to rise with her delicate soaking neck she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird the clumsy movement made by vronsky had broken her back but that he only knew much later at that moment he knew only that makhotin had flown swiftly by while he stood staggering alone on the muddy motionless ground and lay gasping before him bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eye still unable to realize what had happened vronsky tugged at his reins again she struggled all over like a fish and her shoulders making the wings of the saddle crackle she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back she quivered all over and again fell on her side with his face hideous with passion pale his lower jaw trembling vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein she did not stir but thrusting her nose into the ground she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes 
 groaned vronsky clutching at his head ah what have i done he cried the race lost and my fault shameful unpardonable and the poor darling ruined mare ah what have i done 
 a crowd of men a doctor and his assistant the officers of his regiment ran up to him to his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt the mare had broken her back and it was decided to shoot her vronsky could not answer questions could not speak to anyone he turned and without picking up his fallen cap walked away from the racecourse unconscious of where he was going he felt utterly wretched for the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune misfortune beyond remedy and caused by his own fault 
 iashvin overtook him with his cap and led him home and half an hour later vronsky had regained his but the memory of that race remained for long in his heart the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life

 o my sweet he said inwardly to as he listened for what was happening behind cleared it he thought catching the thud of hoofs behind him there remained only the last ditch filled with water and two arsheenes wide vronsky did not even look at it but anxious to come in a long way ahead began sawing away at the reins lifting the head and letting it go in time with her paces he felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength not her neck and shoulders merely were wet but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane her head her sharp ears and her breath came in short sharp gasps but he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining two hundred sazhenes it was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace she flew over the ditch as though not noticing it she flew over it like a bird but at the same instant vronsky to his horror felt that failing to keep up with the pace he had he did not know how made an abominable unpardonable move in recovering his seat in the saddle all at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened he could not yet make out what had happened when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him and makhotin passed at a swift gallop vronsky was touching the ground with one foot and his mare was sinking on that foot he just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side gasping painfully and making vain efforts to rise with her delicate soaking neck she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird the clumsy movement made by vronsky had broken her back but that he only knew much later at that moment he knew only that makhotin had flown swiftly by while he stood staggering alone on the muddy motionless ground and lay gasping before him bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eye still unable to realize what had happened vronsky tugged at his reins again she struggled all over like a fish and her shoulders making the wings of the saddle crackle she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back she quivered all over and again fell on her side with his face hideous with passion pale his lower jaw trembling vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein she did not stir but thrusting her nose into the ground she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes 
 groaned vronsky clutching at his head ah what have i done he cried the race lost and my fault shameful unpardonable and the poor darling ruined mare ah what have i done 
 a crowd of men a doctor and his assistant the officers of his regiment ran up to him to his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt the mare had broken her back and it was decided to shoot her vronsky could not answer questions could not speak to anyone he turned and without picking up his fallen cap walked away from the racecourse unconscious of where he was going he felt utterly wretched for the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune misfortune beyond remedy and caused by his own fault 
 iashvin overtook him with his cap and led him home and half an hour later vronsky had regained his but the memory of that race remained for long in his heart the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life

 the external relations of alexei alexandrovich and his wife had remained unchanged the sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever as in former years at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering place for the sake of his health being deranged every year with his strenuous winter work and just as always he returned in july and at once fell to his usual work with increased energy just as always too his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town while he remained in peterburg 
 from the date of their conversation after the party at princess he had never spoken again to anna of his suspicions and his jealousies and that habitual tone of his of bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife he was a little colder to his wife he simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight conversation which she had repelled in his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation but nothing more you would not be open with me he seemed to say mentally addressing her so much the worse for you now you may beg as you please but i be open with you so much the worse for you he said mentally like a man who after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say oh very well then you shall burn for this 
 this man so subtle and astute in official life did not realize all the insanity of such an attitude to his wife he did not realize it because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings toward his family that is his wife and son he who had been such a considerate father had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son and adopted to him just the same bantering tone as he used with his wife aha young man was the greeting with which he met him 
 alexei alexandrovich asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year but he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings toward his wife and son and his thoughts about them which became more terrible the longer they lay there if anyone had had the right to ask alexei alexandrovich what he thought of his behavior the mild and peaceable alexei alexandrovich would have made no answer but he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject it was precisely for this reason that there came into alexei face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his health alexei alexandrovich did not want to think at all about his behavior and feelings and he actually succeeded in not thinking about them at all 
 alexei permanent summer villa was in peterhof and the countess lidia ivanovna used to spend the summer there close to anna and constantly seeing her that year countess lidia ivanovna declined to settle in peterhof did not call once at anna and had hinted to alexei alexandrovich about the unsuitability of close intimacy with betsy and vronsky alexei alexandrovich had sternly cut her short roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion and from that time began to avoid countess lidia ivanovna he did not want to see and did not see that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife he did not want to understand and did not understand why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at tsarskoe where betsy was staying and not far from the camp of regiment he did not allow himself to think about it and he did not think about it but all the same though he never admitted it to himself and had no proofs nor even suspicious evidence at the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband and he was profoundly miserable about it 
 how often during those eight years of happy life with his wife had alexei alexandrovich looked at other faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself how can people descend to that how is it they put an end to such a hideous situation but now when the misfortune had come upon himself he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the situation that he would not recognize it at all would not recognize it just because it was too awful too unnatural 
 since his return from abroad alexei alexandrovich had been twice at their country villa once he dined there another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends but he had not once stayed the night there as it had been his habit to do in previous years 
 the day of the races had been a very busy day for alexei alexandrovich but when sketching out the day in the morning he made up his mind to go immediately after his early dinner to their summer villa to see his wife and from there to the races which all the court were to witness and at which he was bound to be present he was going to see his wife because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances and besides on that day as it was the fifteenth he had to give his wife some money for her expenses according to their usual arrangement 
 with his habitual control over his thoughts though he thought all this about his wife he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her 
 that morning was a very full one for alexei alexandrovich the evening before countess lidia ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in china who was staying in peterburg and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view and likely to be useful alexei alexandrovich had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening and finished it in the morning then people began arriving with petitions and then came the reports interviews appointments dismissals apportionment of rewards pensions payments papers the workday round as alexei alexandrovich called it that always took up so much time then there was a private business of his own a visit from the doctor and from the steward who managed his property the steward did not take up much time he simply gave alexei alexandrovich the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs which was not altogether satisfactory as during that year owing to increased expenses more had been paid out than usual and there was a deficit but the doctor a celebrated peterburg doctor who was an intimate acquaintance of alexei alexandrovich had taken up a great deal of time alexei alexandrovich had not expected him that day and was surprised at his visit and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health listened to his breathing and tapped at his liver alexei alexandrovich did not know that his friend lidia ivanovna noticing that he was not as well as usual that year had begged the doctor to go and examine him do this for my sake the countess lidia ivanovna had said to him 
 i will do it for the sake of russia countess replied the doctor 
 a priceless man said the countess lidia ivanovna 
 the doctor was extremely dissatisfied with alexei alexandrovich he found the liver considerably enlarged and the digestive powers weakened while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect he prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible and as far as possible less mental strain and above all no worry in other words just what was as much out of alexei power as abstaining from breathing then he withdrew leaving in alexei alexandrovich an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him and that there was no chance of curing it 
 as he was coming away the doctor chanced to meet on the steps an acquaintance of his sludin who was head clerk in alexei office they had been comrades at the university and though they rarely met they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends and hence there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin 
 how glad i am been seeing him said sludin not well and i fancy well what do you think of him 
 tell you said the doctor beckoning over head to his coachman to bring the carriage round just this said the doctor taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it if you strain the strings and then try to break them find it a difficult job but strain a string to its very utmost and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it and with his close assiduity his conscientious devotion to his work strained to the utmost and some outside burden weighing on him and that not a light one concluded the doctor raising his eyebrows significantly will you be at the races he added as he came down to his carriage yes yes to be sure it does waste a lot of time the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of he had not caught 
 directly after the doctor who had taken up so much time came the celebrated traveler and alexei alexandrovich by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it 
 at the same time with the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to peterburg with whom alexei alexandrovich had to have some conversation after his departure he had to finish the daily routine of business with his head clerk and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain personage on a matter of grave and serious import alexei alexandrovich hardly managed to be back by five his dinner hour and after dining with his head clerk he invited him to drive with him to his summer villa and to the races

 anna was upstairs standing before the looking glass and with assistance pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance 
 too early for betsy she thought and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and protruded from it the black hat of alexei alexandrovich and the ears that she knew so well how unlucky can he be going to stay the night she wondered and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that without dwelling on it for a moment she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she had come to know of late she abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking hardly knowing what she was saying 
 ah how lovely of you she said giving her husband her hand and with a smile greeting sludin who was like one of the family staying the night i hope was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter and now go together only a pity promised betsy coming for me 
 alexei alexandrovich knit his brows at name 
 oh not going to separate the inseparables he said in his usual bantering tone going with mikhail vassilyevich even the doctors order me to walk walk and fancy myself at the springs again 
 no hurry said anna would you like tea 
 she rang 
 bring in tea and tell seriozha that alexei alexandrovich is here well tell me how have you been mikhail vassilyevich not been to see me before look how lovely it is out on the terrace she said turning first to one and then to the other 
 she spoke very simply and naturally but too much and too fast she was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look which mikhail vassilyevich turned on her that he was as it were keeping watch on her 
 mikhail vassilyevich promptly went out on the terrace 
 she sat down beside her husband 
 you look quite well she said 
 yes he said the been with me today and wasted an hour of my time i feel that some one of our friends must have sent him my so precious 
 come what did he say 
 she questioned him about his health and what he had been doing and tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her 
 all this she said brightly rapidly and with a peculiar brilliance in her eyes but alexei alexandrovich did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers he heard only her words and gave them only the direct sense they bore and he answered simply though jestingly there was nothing remarkable in all this conversation but never after could anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame 
 seriozha came in preceded by his governess if alexei alexandrovich had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which seriozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother but he would not see anything and he did not see it 
 ah the young man grown really getting quite a man how are you young man 
 and he gave his hand to the scared child 
 seriozha had been shy of his father before and now ever since alexei alexandrovich had taken to calling him young man and since that insolvable question had occurred to him as to whether vronsky were friend or foe he avoided his father he looked round toward his mother as though seeking refuge it was only with his mother that he was at ease meanwhile alexei alexandrovich was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the governess and seriozha was so miserably uncomfortable that anna saw he was on the point of tears 
 anna who had flushed a little the instant her son had come in noticing that seriozha was uncomfortable got up hurriedly took alexei hand from her shoulder and kissing the boy led him out onto the terrace and quickly came back 
 time to start though said she glancing at her watch how is it betsy come 
 yes said alexei alexandrovich and getting up he folded his hands and cracked his fingers come to bring you some money too for nightingales we know live on fairy tales he said you want it i expect 
 no i yes i do she said without looking at him and crimsoning to the roots of her hair but come back here after the races i suppose 
 oh yes answered alexei alexandrovich and the glory of peterhof princess tverskaia he added looking out of the window at the english harnessed carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high what elegance charming well let us be starting too then 
 princess tverskaia did not get out of her carriage but her liveryman in spatterdashes a cape and black high hat jumped off at the entrance 
 going said anna and kissing her son she went up to alexei alexandrovich and held out her hand to him it was ever so lovely of you to come 
 alexei alexandrovich kissed her hand 
 well au revoir then come back for some tea be delightful she said and went out radiant and gay but as soon as he was out of sight she became aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched and she shuddered with repulsion

 chapter 
 
 when alexei alexandrovich reached the racecourse anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside betsy in that pavilion where the highest society had gathered she caught sight of her husband in the distance two men her husband and her lover were the two centers of her existence and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their proximity she was aware of her husband approaching a long way off and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving she watched his progress toward the pavilion saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow now exchanging friendly nonchalant greetings with his equals now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world and taking off his big round hat that pressed down the tips of his ears all these ways of his she knew and all were hateful to her nothing but ambition nothing but desire to get on all there is in his soul she thought as for his lofty ideals love of culture religion they are only so many tools for getting on 
 from his glances toward the ladies pavilion he was staring straight at her but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin ribbons feathers parasols and flowers she saw that he was looking for her but she purposely avoided noticing him 
 alexei alexandrovich princess betsy called to him sure you see your wife here she is 
 he smiled his chilly smile 
 so much splendor here that eyes are dazzled he said and he went into the pavilion he smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her and greeted the princess and other acquaintances giving to each what was due that is to say jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men below near the pavilion was standing an adjutant general of whom alexei alexandrovich had a high opinion noted for his intelligence and culture alexei alexandrovich entered into conversation with him 
 there was an interval between the races and so nothing hindered conversation the adjutant general expressed his disapproval of races alexei alexandrovich replied defending them anna heard his high measured tones without losing one word and every word struck her as false and stabbed her ears with pain 
 when the steeplechase was beginning she bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted and at the same time she heard that loathsome voice of her husband she was in an agony of terror for vronsky but a still greater agony was the as it seemed to her stream of her shrill voice with its familiar intonations 
 a wicked woman a lost woman she thought but i like lying i endure falsehood while as for him her husband falsehood is the breath of life to him he knows all about it he sees it all what does he care if he can talk so calmly if he were to kill me if he were to kill vronsky i might respect him no all he wants is falsehood and propriety anna said to herself not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband and how she would have liked to see him behave she did not understand either that alexei peculiar loquacity that day so exasperating to her was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness as a child that has been hurt hops about putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain in the same way alexei alexandrovich needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in and with the continual iteration of his name would force themselves on his attention and it is as natural for a child to hop about as it was natural for him to talk well and cleverly he was saying 
 danger in the races to officers to cavalrymen is an essential element in the race if england can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men sport has in my opinion a great value and as is always the case we see nothing but what is most superficial 
 not superficial said princess tverskaia one of the officers they say has broken two ribs 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled his smile which uncovered his teeth but revealed nothing more 
 admit princess that not superficial he said but internal but not the point and he turned again to the general with whom he talked seriously we forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men who have chosen that career and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side it forms an integral part of the duties of an officer low sports such as prize fighting or spanish bullfights are a sign of barbarity but specialized trials of skill are a sign of development 
 no i come another time too upsetting said princess betsy it anna 
 it is upsetting but one tear oneself away said another lady if been a roman woman i should never have missed a single circus 
 anna said nothing and keeping her opera glass up gazed always at the same spot 
 at that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion breaking off what he was saying alexei alexandrovich got up hurriedly though with dignity and bowed low to the general 
 not racing the officer asked chaffing him 
 my race is a harder one alexei alexandrovich responded deferentially 
 and though the answer meant nothing the general looked as though he had heard a witty remark from a witty man and fully relished la pointe de la sauce 
 there are two aspects alexei alexandrovich resumed those who take part and those who look on and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator i admit but 
 any bets princess sounded stepan voice from below addressing betsy your favorite 
 anna and i are for kuzovlev replied betsy 
 for vronsky a pair of gloves 
 done 
 but it is a pretty sight it 
 alexei alexandrovich paused while the others were talking near him but he began again directly 
 i admit that manly sports do not he made an attempt to continue 
 but at that moment the racers started and all conversation ceased alexei alexandrovich also fell silent and everyone stood up and turned toward the stream alexei alexandrovich took no interest in the race and so he did not watch the racers but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes his eyes rested upon anna 
 her face was white and stern she was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man her hand had convulsively clutched her fan and she held her breath he looked at her and hastily turned away scrutinizing other faces 
 but this lady too and others very much moved as well very natural alexei alexandrovich told himself he tried not to look at her but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her he examined that face again trying not to read what was so plainly written on it and against his own will with horror read in it what he did not want to know 
 the first fall at the stream agitated everyone but alexei alexandrovich saw distinctly on pale triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen when after makhotin and vronsky had cleared the worst barrier the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public alexei alexandrovich saw that anna did not even notice it and had some difficulty in realizing what they were saying around her but more and more often and with greater persistence he watched her anna wholly engrossed as she was with the sight of vronsky racing became aware of her cold eyes fixed upon her from aside 
 she glanced round for an instant looked inquiringly at him and with a slight frown turned away again 
 ah i care she seemed to say to him and she did not once glance at him again 
 the race was an unlucky one and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half had been thrown and hurt toward the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation which was intensified by the fact that the czar was displeased

 when alexei alexandrovich reached the racecourse anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside betsy in that pavilion where the highest society had gathered she caught sight of her husband in the distance two men her husband and her lover were the two centers of her existence and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their proximity she was aware of her husband approaching a long way off and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving she watched his progress toward the pavilion saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow now exchanging friendly nonchalant greetings with his equals now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world and taking off his big round hat that pressed down the tips of his ears all these ways of his she knew and all were hateful to her nothing but ambition nothing but desire to get on all there is in his soul she thought as for his lofty ideals love of culture religion they are only so many tools for getting on 
 from his glances toward the ladies pavilion he was staring straight at her but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin ribbons feathers parasols and flowers she saw that he was looking for her but she purposely avoided noticing him 
 alexei alexandrovich princess betsy called to him sure you see your wife here she is 
 he smiled his chilly smile 
 so much splendor here that eyes are dazzled he said and he went into the pavilion he smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her and greeted the princess and other acquaintances giving to each what was due that is to say jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men below near the pavilion was standing an adjutant general of whom alexei alexandrovich had a high opinion noted for his intelligence and culture alexei alexandrovich entered into conversation with him 
 there was an interval between the races and so nothing hindered conversation the adjutant general expressed his disapproval of races alexei alexandrovich replied defending them anna heard his high measured tones without losing one word and every word struck her as false and stabbed her ears with pain

 chapter 
 
 everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered the lions and gladiators will be the next thing and everyone was feeling horrified so that when vronsky fell to the ground and anna moaned aloud there was nothing very much out of the way in it but afterward a change came over face which really went beyond decorum she utterly lost her head she began fluttering like a caged bird at one moment wanting to get up and move away and at the next turning to betsy 
 let us go let us go she said 
 but betsy did not hear her she was bending down talking to a general who had come up to her 
 alexei alexandrovich went up to anna and courteously offered her his arm 
 let us go if you like he said in french but anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband 
 broken his leg too so they say the general was saying this surpasses everything 
 without answering her husband anna lifted her opera glass and gazed toward the place where vronsky had fallen but it was so far off and there was such a crowd of people about it that she could make out nothing she put down the opera glass and would have moved away but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the czar anna craned forward listening 
 stiva stiva she cried to her brother 
 but her brother did not hear her again she would have moved away 
 once more i offer you my arm if you want to be going said alexei alexandrovich reaching for her hand 
 she drew back from him with aversion and without looking at his face answered 
 no no leave me alone stay 
 she saw now that from the place of accident an officer was running across the course toward the pavilion betsy waved her handkerchief to him the officer brought the news that the rider was not killed but that the back of the horse had been broken 
 on hearing this anna sat down hurriedly and hid her face in her fan alexei alexandrovich saw that she was weeping and could not control her tears nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom alexei alexandrovich stood so as to screen her giving her time to recover herself 
 for the third time i offer you my arm he said to her after a short interval turning to her anna gazed at him and did not know what to say princess betsy came to her rescue 
 no alexei alexandrovich i brought anna and i promised to take her home put in betsy 
 excuse me princess he said smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face but i see that not very well and i wish her to come home with me 
 anna looked about her in a frightened way got up submissively and laid her hand on her arm 
 send to him and find out and let you know betsy whispered to her 
 as they left the pavilion alexei alexandrovich as always talked to those he met and anna had as always to talk and answer but she was utterly beside herself and moved hanging on her arm as though in a dream 
 is he killed or not is it true will he come or not shall i see him today she was thinking 
 she took her seat in her carriage in silence and in silence drove out of the press of carriages in spite of all he had seen alexei alexandrovich still did not allow himself to consider his real condition he merely saw the outward symptoms he saw that she was behaving unbecomingly and considered it his duty to tell her so but it was very difficult for him not to say more to tell her nothing but that he opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved unbecomingly but he could not help saying something utterly different 
 what an inclination we all have though for these cruel spectacles he said i observe 
 eh i understand said anna contemptuously 
 he was offended and at once began to say what he had meant to say 
 i am obliged to tell you he began 
 so now we are to have it out she thought and she felt frightened 
 i am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today he said to her in french 
 in what way has my behavior been unbecoming she said aloud turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face not with the bright expression that seemed covering something but with a look of determination under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she was feeling 
 be careful he said pointing to the open window opposite the coachman 
 he got up and pulled up the window 
 what did you consider unbecoming she repeated 
 the despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders 
 he waited for her to retort but she was silent looking straight before her 
 i have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you there was a time when i spoke of your inward attitude but i am not speaking of that now now i speak only of your external attitude you have behaved improperly and i would wish it not to occur again 
 she did not hear half of what he was saying she felt before him and was thinking whether it was true that vronsky was not killed was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt but that the back of the horse had been broken she merely smiled with a forced smile when he finished and made no reply because she had not heard what he said alexei alexandrovich had begun to speak boldly but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of the dismay she was feeling infected him too he saw the smile and a strange misapprehension came over him 
 she is smiling at my suspicions yes she will tell me directly what she told me before that there is no foundation for my suspicions that the whole thing is absurd 
 at that moment when the revelation of everything was hanging over him there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless so terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe anything but the expression of her face scared and gloomy did not now promise even deception 
 possibly i was mistaken said he if so i beg your pardon 
 no you were not mistaken she said slowly looking desperately into his frigid face you were not mistaken i was in despair nor could i help being in despair i am listening to you but i am thinking of him i love him i am his mistress i bear you afraid of you and i hate you you can do what you like to me 
 and dropping back into the corner of the carriage she broke into sobs hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich did not stir and kept looking straight before him but his whole face suddenly bore the solemn rigidity of the dead and his expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home on reaching the house he turned his head to her still with the same expression 
 very well but i expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time his voice shook as i may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you 
 he got out first and helped her to get out before the servants he pressed her hand took his seat in the carriage and drove back to peterburg 
 immediately afterward a footman came from princess betsy and brought anna a note 
 i sent to alexei to find out how he is and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt but in despair 
 so he will be here she thought what a good thing i told him all 
 she glanced at her watch she had still three hours to wait and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame 
 my god how light it is dreadful but i do love to see his face and i do love this fantastic light my husband oh yes well thank god at an end with him

 chapter 
 
 in the little german watering place to which the shcherbatskys had betaken themselves as in all places indeed where people are gathered together the usual process as it were of the crystallization of society went on assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost definitely and unalterably takes the special form of the crystal of snow so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his or her peculiar place 
 frst shcherbatsky samt gemahlin und tochter by the apartments they took and from their name and from the friends they made were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them 
 there was visiting the watering place that year a real german frstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever princess shcherbatsky wished above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite kitty made a low and graceful curtsy in the very simple that is to say very elegant frock that had been ordered for her from paris the german princess said i hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face and for the shcherbatskyg certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing the shcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady and of a german countess and her son wounded in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister yet inevitably the shcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady marya eugenyevna rtishcheva and her daughter whom kitty disliked because she had fallen ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty had known from childhood and had always seen in uniform and epaulets and who now with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there was no getting rid of him when all this was so firmly established kitty began to be very much bored especially as the prince went off to carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother she took no interest in the people she knew feeling that nothing fresh would come of them her chief mental interest in the watering place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know it was characteristic of kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible especially so in those she did not know and now as she made surmises as to who people were what were their relations to one another and what they were like kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters and found confirmation in her observations 
 of these people the one that attracted her most was a russian girl who had come to the watering place with an invalid russian lady madame stahl as everyone called her madame stahl belonged to the highest society but she was so ill that she could not walk and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage but it was not so much from as from pride so princess shcherbatskaia interpreted it that madame stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there the russian girl looked after madame stahl and besides that she was as kitty observed on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill and there were many of them at the springs and was solicitous over them in the most natural way this russian girl was not as kitty gathered related to madame stahl nor was she a paid attendant madame stahl called her varenka and other people called her mademoiselle varenka apart from the interest kitty took in this relations with madame stahl and with other unknown persons kitty as often happened felt an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her 
 of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth but she was as it were a creature without youth she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty if her features were criticized separately she was handsome rather that plain in spite of the sickly hue of her face hers would have been a good figure too if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head which was too large for her medium height but she was not likely to be attractive to men she was like a fine flower already past its bloom and without fragrance though the petals were still unwithered moreover she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality and the consciousness of her own attractiveness 
 she always seemed absorbed in work beyond a doubt and so it seemed as if she could take no interest in anything outside it it was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the great attraction of mademoiselle varenka kitty felt that in her in her manner of life she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking interest in life a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men which so revolted kitty and appeared to her now as a shameful exhibition of goods in search of a purchaser the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend the more convinced she was that this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance 
 the two girls used to meet several times a day and every time they met eyes said who are you what are you are you really the exquisite creature i imagine you to be but for goodness sake suppose her eyes added that i would force my acquaintance on you i simply admire you and like you i like you too and very very sweet and i should like you better still if i had time answered the eyes of the unknown girl kitty saw indeed that she was always busy either she was taking the children of a russian family home from the springs or fetching a shawl for a sick lady and wrapping her up in it or trying to interest an irritable invalid or selecting and buying teacakes for someone 
 soon after the arrival of the shcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention these were a tall man with a stooping figure and huge hands in an old coat too short for him with black simple and yet terrible eyes and a woman very badly and tastelessly dressed recognizing these persons as russians kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them but the princess having ascertained from the kurliste that this was nikolai levin and marya nikolaevna explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was and all her fancies about these two people vanished not so much from what her mother told her as from the fact that it was brother this pair suddenly seemed to kitty in the highest degree unpleasant this levin with his continual twitching of his head aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust 
 it seemed to her that his big terrible eyes which persistently pursued her expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt and she tried to avoid meeting him

 there was visiting the watering place that year a real german frstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever princess shcherbatsky wished above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite kitty made a low and graceful curtsy in the very simple that is to say very elegant frock that had been ordered for her from paris the german princess said i hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face and for the shcherbatskyg certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing the shcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady and of a german countess and her son wounded in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister yet inevitably the shcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady marya eugenyevna rtishcheva and her daughter whom kitty disliked because she had fallen ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty had known from childhood and had always seen in uniform and epaulets and who now with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there was no getting rid of him when all this was so firmly established kitty began to be very much bored especially as the prince went off to carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother she took no interest in the people she knew feeling that nothing fresh would come of them her chief mental interest in the watering place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know it was characteristic of kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible especially so in those she did not know and now as she made surmises as to who people were what were their relations to one another and what they were like kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters and found confirmation in her observations 
 of these people the one that attracted her most was a russian girl who had come to the watering place with an invalid russian lady madame stahl as everyone called her madame stahl belonged to the highest society but she was so ill that she could not walk and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage but it was not so much from as from pride so princess shcherbatskaia interpreted it that madame stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there the russian girl looked after madame stahl and besides that she was as kitty observed on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill and there were many of them at the springs and was solicitous over them in the most natural way this russian girl was not as kitty gathered related to madame stahl nor was she a paid attendant madame stahl called her varenka and other people called her mademoiselle varenka apart from the interest kitty took in this relations with madame stahl and with other unknown persons kitty as often happened felt an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her 
 of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth but she was as it were a creature without youth she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty if her features were criticized separately she was handsome rather that plain in spite of the sickly hue of her face hers would have been a good figure too if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head which was too large for her medium height but she was not likely to be attractive to men she was like a fine flower already past its bloom and without fragrance though the petals were still unwithered moreover she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality and the consciousness of her own attractiveness 
 she always seemed absorbed in work beyond a doubt and so it seemed as if she could take no interest in anything outside it it was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the great attraction of mademoiselle varenka kitty felt that in her in her manner of life she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking interest in life a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men which so revolted kitty and appeared to her now as a shameful exhibition of goods in search of a purchaser the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend the more convinced she was that this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance 
 the two girls used to meet several times a day and every time they met eyes said who are you what are you are you really the exquisite creature i imagine you to be but for goodness sake suppose her eyes added that i would force my acquaintance on you i simply admire you and like you i like you too and very very sweet and i should like you better still if i had time answered the eyes of the unknown girl kitty saw indeed that she was always busy either she was taking the children of a russian family home from the springs or fetching a shawl for a sick lady and wrapping her up in it or trying to interest an irritable invalid or selecting and buying teacakes for someone 
 soon after the arrival of the shcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention these were a tall man with a stooping figure and huge hands in an old coat too short for him with black simple and yet terrible eyes and a woman very badly and tastelessly dressed recognizing these persons as russians kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them but the princess having ascertained from the kurliste that this was nikolai levin and marya nikolaevna explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was and all her fancies about these two people vanished not so much from what her mother told her as from the fact that it was brother this pair suddenly seemed to kitty in the highest degree unpleasant this levin with his continual twitching of his head aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust 
 it seemed to her that his big terrible eyes which persistently pursued her expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt and she tried to avoid meeting him

 it was a foul day it had been raining all the morning and the invalids with their parasols had flocked into the arcades 
 kitty was walking there with her mother and the moscow colonel smart and jaunty in his european coat bought at frankfort they were walking on one side of the arcade trying to avoid levin who was walking on the other side varenka in her dark dress in a black hat with a turndown brim was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind frenchwoman and every time she met kitty they exchanged friendly glances 
 mamma i speak to her said kitty watching her unknown friend and noticing that she was going up to the spring and that they might come there together 
 oh if you want to so much find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself answered her mother what do you see in her out of the way a companion most probably if you like make acquaintance with madame stahl i used to know her added the princess lifting her head haughtily 
 kitty knew that the princess was offended because madame stahl had apparently avoided making her acquaintance kitty did not insist 
 how wonderfully sweet she is she said gazing at varenka just as she handed a glass to the frenchwoman look how natural and sweet it all is 
 so funny to see your engouements said the princess no better go back she added noticing levin coming toward them with his companion and a german doctor to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily 
 they turned to go back when suddenly they heard not merely noisy talk but actual shouting levin stopping short was shouting at the doctor and the doctor too was excited a crowd gathered about them the princess and kitty beat a hasty retreat while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was up 
 a few minutes later the colonel overtook them 
 what was it inquired the princess 
 scandalous and disgraceful answered the colonel the one thing to be dreaded is meeting russians abroad that tall gentleman was abusing the doctor flinging all sorts of insults at him because he treating him quite as he liked and he began waving his stick at him simply scandalous 
 oh how unpleasant said the princess well and how did it end 
 luckily at that point that miss the one in the mushroom hat intervened she is a russian lady i think said the colonel 
 mademoiselle varenka kitty asked joyously 
 yes yes she came to the rescue before anyone else she took the man by the arm and led him away 
 there mamma said kitty yet you wonder why enthusiastic about her 
 the next day as she watched her unknown friend kitty noticed that mademoiselle varenka was already on the same terms with levin and his companion as with her other proteges she went up to them entered into conversation with them and served as interpreter for the woman who could not speak any foreign language 
 kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make acquaintance with varenka and disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of madame stahl who thought fit to give herself airs she made inquiries about varenka and having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there could he no harm even if little good in the acquaintance she herself approached varenka and made acquaintance with her 
 choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring while varenka had stopped outside the the princess approached her 
 allow me to make your acquaintance she said with her dignified smile my daughter has lost her heart to you she said possibly you do not know me i am 
 that feeling is more than reciprocal princess varenka answered hurriedly 
 what a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot said the princess 
 varenka flushed a little 
 i remember i think i did anything she said 
 why you saved that levin from disagreeable consequences 
 yes sa compagne called me and i tried to pacify him very ill and was dissatisfied with the doctor used to looking after such invalids 
 yes heard you live at mentone with your aunt i think madame stahl i used to know her 
 no not my aunt i call her maman but i am not related to her i was brought up by her answered varenka flushing a little again 
 this was so simply said and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face that the princess saw why kitty had taken such a fancy to varenka 
 well and this levin going to do asked the princess 
 going away answered varenka 
 at that instant kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight because her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend 
 see kitty your intense desire to make friends with mademoiselle 
 varenka varenka put in smiling what everyone calls me 
 kitty blushed with pleasure and slowly without speaking squeezed her new hand which did not respond to her pressure but lay motionless in her hand the hand did not respond to her pressure but the face of mademoiselle varenka glowed with a soft glad though rather mournful smile that showed large but handsome teeth 
 i have long wished for this too she said 
 but but you are so busy 
 oh no not at all busy answered varenka but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little russian girls children of an invalid ran up to her 
 varenka calling they cried 
 and varenka went after them

 chapter 
 
 the particulars which the princess had learned in regard to past and her relations with madame stahl were as follows 
 madame stahl of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament when after her separation from her husband she gave birth to her only child the child had died almost immediately and the family of madame stahl knowing her sensibility and fearing the news would kill her had substituted another child a baby born the same night and in the same house in peterburg the daughter of the chief cook of the imperial household this was varenka madame stahl learned later on that varenka was not her own child but she went on bringing her up especially as very soon afterward varenka had not a relation of her own living 
 madame stahl had now been living without a break more than ten years abroad in the south never leaving her couch and some people said that madame stahl had made her social position as a philanthropic highly religious woman other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures which she represented herself to be no one knew what her faith was catholic protestant or orthodox but one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects 
 varenka lived with her all the while abroad and everyone who knew madame stahl knew and liked mademoiselle varenka as everyone called her 
 having learned all these facts the princess found nothing to object to in her intimacy with varenka more especially as breeding and education were of the best she spoke french and english extremely well and what was of the most weight brought a message from madame stahl expressing her regret that she had been prevented by her from making the acquaintance of the princess 
 after getting to know varenka kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend and every day she discovered new virtues in her 
 the princess hearing that varenka had a good voice asked her to come and sing to them in the evening 
 kitty plays and we have a piano not a good one true but you will give us so much pleasure said the princess with her affected smile which kitty disliked particularly just then because she noticed that varenka had no inclination to sing varenka came however in the evening and brought a roll of music with her the princess had invited marya eugenyevna and her daughter and the colonel 
 varenka seemed quite unaffected by the presence of persons whom she did not know and she went directly to the piano she could not accompany herself but she could sing music at sight very well kitty who played well accompanied her 
 you have an extraordinary talent the princess said to her after varenka had sung the first song excellently 
 marya eugenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration 
 look said the colonel looking out of the window what an audience has collected to listen to you 
 there actually was a considerable crowd under the windows 
 i am very glad it gives you pleasure varenka answered simply 
 kitty looked with pride at her friend she was enchanted by her talent and her voice and her face but most of all by her manner by obviously thinking nothing of her singing and being quite unmoved by their praise she seemed only to be asking am i to sing again or is that enough 
 if it had been i thought kitty how proud i should have been how delighted i should have been to see that crowd under the windows but utterly unmoved by it her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please maman what is there about her what is it gives her the power to look down on everything to be calm independently of everything how i should like to know it and to learn it from her thought kitty gazing into her serene face the princess asked varenka to sing again and varenka sang another song also smoothly distinctly and well standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin hand 
 the next song in the book was an italian one kitty played the opening bars and looked round at varenka 
 skip that said varenka flushing a little 
 kitty let her eyes rest on face with a look of dismay and inquiry 
 very well the next one she said hurriedly turning over the pages and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song 
 no answered varenka with a smile laying her hand on the music no have that one and she sang it just as quietly as coolly and as well as the others 
 when she had finished they all thanked her again and went off to tea kitty and varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house 
 am i right that you have some reminiscences connected with that song said kitty tell me she added hastily only say if right 
 no why not tell you said varenka simply and without waiting for a reply she went on yes it brings up memories once painful ones i cared for someone once and i used to sing him that song 
 kitty with big eyes gazed silently sympathetically at varenka 
 i cared for him and he cared for me but his mother was opposed and he married another girl living now not far from us and i see him sometimes you think i had a love story too she said and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which kitty felt must once have glowed all over her 
 i think so why if i were a man i could never care for anyone else after knowing you only i understand how he could to please his mother forget you and make you unhappy he had no heart 
 oh no a very good man and not unhappy quite the contrary very happy well we be singing any more now she added turning toward the house 
 how good you are how good you are cried kitty and stopping her she kissed her if i could only be even a little like you 
 why should you be like anyone lovely as you are said varenka smiling her gentle weary smile 
 no not lovely at all come tell me stop a minute sit down said kitty making her sit down again beside her tell me it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love that he cared for it 
 but he disdain it i believe he cared for me but he was a dutiful son 
 yes but if it been on account of his mother if it had been his own doing said kitty feeling she was giving away her secret and that her face burning with the flush of shame had betrayed her already 
 in that case he would have done wrong and i should not have regretted him answered varenka evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her but of kitty 
 but the humiliation said kitty the humiliation one can never forget never she said remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music 
 where is the humiliation why you did nothing wrong 
 worse than wrong shameful 
 varenka shook her head and laid her hand on 
 why shameful about it she said you tell a man who care for you that you loved him did you 
 of course not i never said a word but he knew it no no there are looks there are ways i forget it if i live a hundred years 
 why so i understand the whole point is whether you love him now or not said varenka who called everything by its name 
 i hate him i forgive myself 
 why what for 
 the shame the humiliation 
 oh if everyone were as sensitive as you are said varenka there a girl who been through the same and all so unimportant 
 why what is important said kitty looking into her face with inquisitive wonder 
 oh so much important said varenka smiling 
 why what 
 oh so much more important answered varenka not knowing what to say but at that instant they heard the voice from the window kitty cold either get a shawl or come indoors 
 it really is time to go in said varenka getting up i have to go on to madame she asked me to 
 kitty held her by the hand and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her what is it what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquility you know tell me but varenka did not even know what eyes were asking her she merely thought that she had to go to see madame berthe too that evening and to make haste home in time for tea at twelve she went indoors collected her music and saying to everyone was about to go 
 allow me to see you home said the colonel 
 yes how can you go alone at night like this chimed in the princess anyway send parasha 
 kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort 
 no i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me she said taking her hat and kissing kitty once more without saying what was important she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her that calm and dignity so much to be envied

 chapter 
 
 kitty made the acquaintance of madame stahl too and this acquaintance together with her friendship with varenka did not merely exercise a great influence on her it also comforted her in her mental distress she found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance a world having nothing in common with her past an exalted noble world from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly it was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life this life was disclosed in religion but a religion having nothing in common with that one which kitty had known from childhood and which found expression in masses and evening services at the home where one might meet friends and in learning by heart slavonic texts with the priest this was a lofty mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings which one could not merely believe because one was told to believe but which one could love 
 kitty found all this out not from words madame stahl talked to kitty as to a charming child that one regards with pleasure as one regards the memory of youth and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith and that in the sight of compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately talked of other things but in every gesture of madame stahl in every word in every heavenly as kitty called it look and above all in the whole story of her life which she heard from varenka kitty recognized that something that was important of which till then she had known nothing 
 yet elevated as madame character was touching as was her story and exalted and moving as was her speech kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her she noticed that when questioning her about her family madame stahl had smiled contemptuously which was not in accord with christian meekness kitty noticed too that when she had found a catholic priest with her madame stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp shade and had smiled in a peculiar way trivial as these two observations were they perplexed her and she had her doubts as to madame stahl but on the other hand varenka alone in the world without friends or relations with a melancholy disappointment in the past desiring nothing regretting nothing was just that perfection of which kitty dared hardly dream in varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others and one will be calm happy and good and that was what kitty longed to be seeing now clearly what was most important kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her from accounts of the doings of madame stahl and other people whom she mentioned kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life she would like madame niece aline of whom varenka had talked to her a great deal seek out those who were in trouble wherever she might be living help them as far as she could giving them the gospel she would read the gospel to the sick to the criminals to the dying the idea of reading the gospel to criminals as aline did particularly fascinated kitty but all these were secret dreams of which kitty did not talk either to her mother or to varenka 
 while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale however kitty even then at the springs where there were so many people ill and unhappy readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of varenka 
 at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the influence of her engouement as she called it for madame stahl and still more for varenka she saw that kitty did not merely imitate varenka in her conduct but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking of talking of blinking her eyes but later on the princess noticed that apart from this adoration some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter 
 the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that madame stahl had given her a thing she had never done before that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under protection and especially one poor family that of a sick painter petrov kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family all this was well enough and the princess had nothing to say against it especially as wife was a perfectly respectable woman and that the german princess noticing devotion praised her calling her an angel of consolation all this would have been very well if there had been no exaggeration but the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes and so indeed she told her 
 il ne faut jamais rien outrer she said to her 
 her daughter made her no reply but in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity was concerned what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten and give shirt if coat were taken but the princess disliked this exaggeration and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother she concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother but simply because she was her mother she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother 
 how is it anna not been to see us for so long the princess said one day referring to madame petrov asked her but she seems put out about something 
 no not noticed it maman said kitty flushing hotly 
 is it long since been to see them 
 we intend making an excursion to the mountains tomorrow answered kitty 
 well you may go answered the princess gazing at her embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment 
 that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the excursion for the morrow and the princess noticed again that kitty reddened 
 kitty you had some misunderstanding with the petrovs said the princess when they were left alone why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us 
 kitty answered that nothing had happened between them and that she could not tell why anna pavlovna seemed displeased with her kitty answered perfectly truthfully she did not know the reason anna pavlovna had changed toward her but she guessed it she guessed at something which she could not tell her mother which she did not put into words to herself it was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken 
 again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family she remembered the simple delight expressed on the round face of anna pavlovna at their meetings she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him and to get him out of doors the devotion of the youngest boy who used to call her my kitty and would not go to bed without her how lovely it all was then she recalled the thin terribly thin figure of petrov with his long neck in his brown coat his scant curly hair his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to kitty at first and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence she recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him as for all consumptive people and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him she recalled the timid softened look with which he gazed at her and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness and later of a sense of her own goodness which she had felt at it how lovely it all was but all that was at first now a few days ago everything was suddenly spoiled anna pavlovna had met kitty with affected cordiality and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband 
 could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of anna coolness 
 yes she mused there was something unnatural about anna pavlovna and utterly unlike her good nature when she said angrily the day before yesterday there he will keep waiting for you he drink his coffee without you though grown so dreadfully weak 
 yes perhaps too she like it when i gave him the rug it was all so simple but he took it so awkwardly and was so long thanking me that i felt awkward too and then that portrait of me he did so well and most of all that look of confusion and tenderness yes yes it kitty repeated to herself with horror no it be it to be so much to be pitied she said to herself directly after

 chapter 
 
 before the end of the water cure prince shcherbatsky who had gone on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to russian friends to get a breath of russian atmosphere as he said came back to his wife and daughter 
 the views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed the princess thought everything delightful and in spite of her established position in russian society she tried abroad to be like a european fashionable lady which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical russian gentlewoman and so she was affected which did not altogether suit her the prince on the contrary thought everything foreign detestable got sick of european life kept to his russian habits and purposely tried to show himself abroad less european than he was in reality 
 the prince returned thinner with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks but in the most cheerful frame of mind his good humor was even greater when he saw kitty completely recovered the news of friendship with madame stahl and varenka and the reports the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him but this unpleasant news was all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him and more so than ever since his course of carlsbad waters 
 the day after his arrival the prince in his long overcoat with his russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor 
 it was a lovely morning the tidy cheerful houses with their little gardens the sight of the german waitresses working away merrily and bright sun did heart good but the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous german life kitty was no longer struck by this contrast the bright sun the brilliant green of the foliage the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence for which she watched but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june morning and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion and above all the appearance of the robust waitresses seemed something unseemly and monstrous in conjunction with these slowly moving cadavers gathered together from all parts of europe 
 in spite of his feeling of pride and as it were of the return of youth when he walked with his favorite daughter on his arm he felt awkward and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy stout and fat limbs he felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd 
 present present me to your new friends he said to his daughter squeezing her hand with his elbow i like even your horrid soden for making you so well again only melancholy very melancholy here that 
 kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met of some with whom she was acquainted and some with whom she was not at the very entrance of the garden they met the blind lady madame berthe with her guide and the prince was delighted to see the old face light up when she heard voice she at once began talking to him with the exaggerated politeness of the french applauding him for having such a delightful daughter extolling kitty to the skies before her face and calling her a treasure a pearl and a consoling angel 
 well the second angel then said the prince smiling she calls mademoiselle varenka angel number one 
 oh mademoiselle varenka a real angel allez madame berthe assented 
 in the arcade they met varenka herself she was walking rapidly toward them carrying an elegant red bag 
 here is papa come kitty said to her 
 varenka made simply and naturally as she did everything a movement between a bow and curtsy and immediately began talking to the prince without shyness naturally as she talked to everyone 
 of course i know you i know you very well the prince said to her with a smile in which kitty detected with joy that her father liked her friend where are you off to in such haste 
 here she said turning to kitty she has not slept all night and the doctor advised her to go out taking her her work 
 so angel number one said the prince when varenka had gone on 
 kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of varenka but that he could not do it because he liked her 
 come so we shall see all your friends he went on even madame stahl if she deigns to recognize me 
 why did you know her papa kitty asked apprehensively catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the eyes at the mention of madame stahl 
 i used to know her husband and her too a little before joined the pietists 
 what is a pietist papa asked kitty dismayed to find that what she prized so highly in madame stahl had a name 
 i quite know myself i only know that she thanks god for everything for every misfortune and thanks god too that her husband died and rather droll as they get on together that what a piteous face he asked noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long fleshless legs this man lifted his straw hat showed his scanty curly hair and high forehead painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat 
 petrov an artist answered kitty blushing and his wife she added indicating anna pavlovna who as though on purpose at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path 
 poor fellow and what a fine face he has said the prince why you go up to him he wanted to speak to you 
 well let us go then said kitty turning round resolutely how are you feeling today she asked petrov 
 petrov got up leaning on his stick and looked shyly at the prince 
 this is my daughter said the prince let me introduce myself 
 the painter bowed and smiled showing his strangely dazzling white teeth 
 we expected you yesterday princess he said to kitty 
 he staggered as he said this and then repeated the motion trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional 
 i meant to come but varenka said that anna pavlovna sent word you were not going 
 not going said petrov blushing and immediately beginning to cough and his eyes sought his wife aneta aneta he said loudly and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck 
 anna pavlovna came up 
 so you sent word to the princess that we going he whispered to her angrily losing his voice 
 good morning princess said anna pavlovna with an assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner very glad to make your acquaintance she said to the prince long been expected prince 
 why did you send word to the princess that we going the artist whispered hoarsely again still more angrily obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to 
 oh mercy on us i thought we going his wife answered crossly 
 what when he coughed and waved his hand 
 the prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter 
 ah ah he sighed deeply oh poor things 
 yes papa answered kitty and you must know three children no servant and scarcely any means he gets something from the academy she went on briskly trying to drown the distress that queer change in anna manner toward her had aroused in her oh madame stahl said kitty indicating an invalid carriage where propped on pillows something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade this was madame stahl behind her stood the gloomy robust german workman who pushed the carriage close by was standing a swedish count whom kitty knew by name several invalids were lingering near the low carriage staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity 
 the prince walked up to her and kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his eyes he walked up to madame stahl and addressed her with extreme courtesy and charm in that excellent french which so few speak nowadays 
 i know if you remember me but i must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter he said taking off his hat and not putting it on again 
 prince alexandre shcherbatsky said madame stahl lifting upon him her heavenly eyes in which kitty discerned a look of annoyance delighted i have taken a great fancy to your daughter 
 you are still in weak health 
 yes used to it said madame stahl and she introduced the prince to the swedish count 
 you are scarcely changed at all the prince said to her ten or eleven years since i had the honor of seeing you 
 yes god sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it often one wonders what is the goal of this life the other side she said angrily to varenka who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her satisfaction 
 to do good probably said the prince with a twinkle in his eye 
 that is not for us to judge said madame stahl perceiving the shade of expression on the face so you will send me that book dear count very grateful to you she said to the young swede 
 ah cried the prince catching sight of the moscow colonel standing near and with a bow to madame stahl he walked away with his daughter and the moscow colonel who joined them 
 our aristocracy prince the moscow colonel said with ironical intention he cherished a grudge against madame stahl for not making his acquaintance 
 the same as ever replied the prince 
 did you know her before her illness prince to say before she took to her bed 
 yes she took to her bed before my eyes said the prince 
 they say ten years since she has stood on her feet 
 she stand up because her legs are too short she has a very bad figure 
 papa not possible cried kitty 
 what wicked tongues say my darling and your varenka is to endure still he added oh these invalid ladies 
 oh no papa kitty objected warmly varenka worships her and then she does so much good ask anyone everyone knows her and aline stahl 
 perhaps so said the prince squeezing her hand with his elbow but better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows 
 kitty did not answer not because she had nothing to say but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father but strange to say although she had made up her mind so firmly not to be influenced by her views not to let him into her inmost sanctuary she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl which she had carried for a whole month in her heart had vanished never to return just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some fallen garment all that was left was a woman with short legs who lay down because she had a bad figure and worried patient varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking and by no effort of her imagination could kitty bring back the former madame stahl

 perhaps so said the prince squeezing her hand with his elbow but better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows 
 kitty did not answer not because she had nothing to say but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father but strange to say although she had made up her mind so firmly not to be influenced by her views not to let him into her inmost sanctuary she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl which she had carried for a whole month in her heart had vanished never to return just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some fallen garment all that was left was a woman with short legs who lay down because she had a bad figure and worried patient varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking and by no effort of her imagination could kitty bring back the former madame stahl

 kitty was glad of all this but she could not be lighthearted she could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his view of her friends and of the life that had so attracted her to this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the petrovs which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning everyone was but kitty could not feel and this increased her distress she felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood when she had been shut in her room as a punishment and had heard her sisters merry laughter outside

 kitty scowling more than ever kept silent and varenka went on speaking alone trying to soften or soothe her and seeing a storm coming she did not know whether of tears or of words 
 so better not go you understand you be offended 
 and it serves me right and it serves me right kitty cried quickly snatching the parasol out of hand and avoiding looking at her face 
 varenka felt inclined to smile looking at her childish fury but she was afraid of wounding her 
 how does it serve you right i understand she said 
 it serves me right because it was all sham because it was all done on purpose and not from the heart what business had i to interfere with outsiders and so come about that the cause of a quarrel and that done what nobody asked me to do because it was all a sham a sham a sham 
 a sham with what object said varenka gently 
 oh so idiotic so hateful there was no need whatever for me nothing but sham she said opening and shutting the parasol 
 but with what object 
 to seem better to people to myself to god to deceive everyone no now i descend to that one could be bad but anyway not a liar not a cheat 
 but who is a cheat said varenka reproachfully you speak as if 
 but kitty was in one of her gusts of fury and she would not let her finish

 but not speaking of other people speaking of myself 
 kitty they heard her voice come here show papa your necklace 
 kitty with a haughty air without making peace with her friend took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother 
 the matter why are you so red her mother and father said to her with one voice 
 nothing she answered be back directly and she ran back 
 still here she thought what am i to say to her oh dear what have i done what have i said why was i rude to her what am i to do what am i to say to her thought kitty and she stopped in the doorway 
 varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at a table examining the parasol spring which kitty had broken she lifted her head 
 varenka forgive me do forgive me whispered kitty going up to her i remember what i said i 
 i really mean to hurt you said varenka smiling 
 peace was made but with her coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for kitty she did not give up everything she had learned but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be her eyes were it seemed opened she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount moreover she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow of sick and dying people in which she had been living the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air to russia to ergushovo where as she knew from letters her sister dolly had already gone with her children 
 but her affection for varenka did not wane parting kitty begged her to come to them in russia

 book minette chapter i 
 chapter ii 
 
 the lowest depths 
 there disinterestedness vanishes 
 the demon is vaguely outlined each one is for himself 
 the i in the eyes howls seeks fumbles and gnaws 
 the social ugolino is in this gulf 
 the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires they are almost unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration 
 they have two mothers both ignorance and misery 
 they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfaction appetite 
 they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger 
 from suffering these spectres pass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy creation logic of darkness that which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest of matter man there becomes a dragon 
 to be hungry to be is the point of departure to be is the point reached from that vault lacenaire emerges 
 we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical excavation 
 there as we have just said all is pure noble dignified honest 
 there assuredly one might be misled but error is worthy of veneration there so thoroughly does it imply heroism 
 the work there effected taken as a whole has a name 
 progress 
 the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths hideous depths 
 there exists beneath society we insist upon this point and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated the great cavern of evil 
 this cavern is below all and is the foe of all 
 it is hatred without exception 
 this cavern knows no philosophers its dagger has never cut a pen 
 its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand 
 never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper 
 babeuf is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to schinderhannes 
 this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything 
 of everything 
 including the upper superior mines which it execrates it not only undermines in its hideous swarming the actual social order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it undermines civilization it undermines revolution it undermines progress its name is simply theft prostitution murder assassination it is darkness and it desires chaos 
 its vault is formed of ignorance 
 all the others those above it have but one suppress it it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by their contemplation of the absolute 
 destroy the cavern ignorance and you destroy the lair crime 
 let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written the only social peril is darkness 
 humanity is identity 
 all men are made of the same clay there is no difference here below at least in predestination the same shadow in front the same flesh in the present the same ashes afterwards 
 but ignorance mingled with the human paste blackens it 
 this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil

 chapter x 
 
 after her funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was asking for orders about their departure this was before his talk with dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace 
 the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward she lay on the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which had shown itself during her illness she wished to pray but did not dare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god she lay for a long time in that position 
 the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays shone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped unconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got up and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening 
 yes you can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one will hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill 
 someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides is it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she thought 
 princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking of the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice 
 your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot think of yourself but with my love for you i must do so has alpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked 
 princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go or where to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it not all the same she thought and did not reply 
 you know chere marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are in danger are surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move now if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knows 
 princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about 
 oh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatych did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing nothing and want to 
 spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow but i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle bourienne because you will agree chere marie to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible 
 mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not printed on ordinary russian paper of general telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford them proper protection she handed this to the princess 
 i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued and and am sure that all due respect would be shown you 
 princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs 
 from whom did you get this she asked 
 they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing 
 princess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince study 
 dunyasha send alpatych or dronushka or somebody to me she said and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing mademoiselle voice we must go at once at once she said appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french 
 if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general rameau for protection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they the french would settle in this house m le general rameau would occupy prince study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of bogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor the soldiers would violate my newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow thought princess mary not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother for herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince study trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered her position 
 the demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by her death all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown force and took possession of her 
 agitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael ivanovich and now for tikhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the other maids could not say in how far mademoiselle statement was correct alpatych was not at home he had gone to the police neither could the architect michael ivanovich who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own he now replied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be got from his answers the old valet tikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princess questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her 
 at length dron the village elder entered the room and with a deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost 
 princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him 
 dronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her dronushka now since our misfortune she began but could not go on 
 we are all in hands said he with a sigh 
 they were silent for a while 
 dronushka alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn to is true as they tell me that i even go away 
 why you go away your excellency you can go said dron 
 i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy dear friend i can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning 
 dron paused he looked askance at princess mary and said there are no horses i told yakov alpatych so 
 why are there none asked the princess 
 all scourge said dron what horses we had have been taken for the army or have died this is such a year not a case of feeding horses we may die of hunger ourselves as it is some go three days without eating nothing been ruined 
 princess mary listened attentively to what he told her 
 the peasants are ruined they have no bread she asked 
 dying of hunger said dron not a case of carting 
 but why you tell me dronushka it possible to help them do all i can 
 to princess mary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the rich could refrain from helping the poor she had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as corn which was sometimes given to the peasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give she was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the peasants needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord 
 but we have grain belonging to my brother she said 
 the grain is all safe replied dron proudly our prince did not order it to be sold 
 give it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you leave in my name said she 
 dron made no answer but sighed deeply 
 give them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all i give this order in my name and tell them that what is ours is theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so 
 dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking 
 discharge me little mother for sake order the keys to be taken from me said he i have served years and have done no wrong discharge me for sake 
 princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants
