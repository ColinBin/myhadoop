 the fir tree 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far down in the forest where the warm sun and the fresh air 
 made a sweet grew a pretty little and yet 
 it was not happy it wished so much to be tall like its companions 
 the pines and firs which grew around it the sun shone and the soft 
 air fluttered its leaves and the little peasant children passed by 
 prattling merrily but the heeded them not sometimes the 
 children would bring a large basket of raspberries or strawberries 
 wreathed on a straw and seat themselves near the and say 
 is it not a pretty little tree which made it feel more unhappy than 
 before and yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller 
 every year for by the number of joints in the stem of a we 
 can discover its age still as it grew it complained oh how i 
 wish i were as tall as the other trees then i would spread out my 
 branches on every side and my top would the wide world 
 i should have the birds building their nests on my boughs and when 
 the wind blew i should bow with stately dignity like my tall companions the tree was so discontented that it took no pleasure in the warm sunshine the birds or the rosy clouds that floated over 
 it morning and evening sometimes in winter when the snow lay 
 white and glittering on the ground a hare would come springing along and jump right over the little tree and then how mortified it would feel two winters passed and when the third arrived the tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it yet it 
 remained unsatisfied and would exclaim oh if i could but keep on 
 growing tall and old there is nothing else worth caring for in the 
 world in the autumn as usual the came and cut down 
 several of the tallest trees and the young which was now 
 grown to its full height shuddered as the noble trees fell to the 
 earth with a crash after the branches were lopped off the trunks 
 looked so slender and bare that they could scarcely be recognized 
 
 then they were placed upon wagons and drawn by horses out of the 
 forest where were they going what would become of them the 
 young wished very much to know so in the spring when the 
 swallows and the storks came it asked do you know where those trees were taken did you meet them 
 
 the swallows knew nothing but the stork after a little 
 reflection nodded his head and said yes i think i do i met 
 several new ships when i flew from egypt and they had fine masts that smelt like fir i think these must have been the trees i assure you 
 they were stately very stately 
 
 oh how i wish i were tall enough to go on the sea said the 
 what is the sea and what does it look like 
 
 it would take too much time to explain said the stork flying 
 quickly away 
 
 rejoice in thy youth said the sunbeam rejoice in thy fresh 
 growth and the young life that is in thee 
 
 and the wind kissed the tree and the dew watered it with tears 
 but the regarded them not 
 
 drew near and many young trees were cut down some even smaller and younger than the who enjoyed neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home these young trees which were chosen for their beauty kept their branches and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of the forest 
 
 where are they going asked the they are not taller 
 than i am indeed one is much less and why are the branches not 
 cut off where are they going 
 
 we know we know sang the sparrows we have looked in at the 
 windows of the houses in the town and we know what is done with them 
 
 they are dressed up in the most splendid manner we have seen them 
 standing in the middle of a warm room and adorned with all sorts of 
 beautiful things honey cakes gilded apples playthings and many 
 hundreds of wax tapers 
 
 and then asked the trembling through all its 
 branches and then what happens 
 
 we did not see any more said the sparrows but this was enough 
 for us 
 
 i wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen to me 
 thought the it would be much better than crossing the 
 sea i long for it almost with pain oh when will christmas be 
 here i am now as tall and well grown as those which were taken away last year oh that i were now laid on the wagon or standing in the warm room with all that brightness and splendor around me 
 something better and more beautiful is to come after or the trees 
 would not be so decked out yes what follows will be grander and more splendid what can it be i am weary with longing i scarcely know how i feel 
 
 rejoice with us said the air and the sunlight enjoy thine own 
 bright life in the fresh air 
 
 but the tree would not rejoice though it grew taller every day 
 and winter and summer its foliage might be seen in the 
 forest while passers by would say what a beautiful tree 
 
 a short time before christmas the discontented was the 
 first to fall as the axe cut through the stem and divided the 
 pith the tree fell with a groan to the earth conscious of pain and 
 faintness and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness in 
 sorrow at leaving its home in the forest it knew that it should never 
 again see its dear old companions the trees nor the little bushes 
 and flowers that had grown by its side perhaps not 
 even the birds neither was the journey at all pleasant the tree 
 first recovered itself while being unpacked in the courtyard of a 
 house with several other trees and it heard a man say we only want one and this is the prettiest 
 
 then came two servants in grand livery and carried the 
 into a large and beautiful apartment on the walls hung pictures 
 and near the great stove stood great china vases with lions on the 
 lids there were rocking chairs silken sofas large tables covered 
 with pictures books and playthings worth a great deal of money at 
 least the children said so then the was placed in a large 
 tub full of sand but green baize hung all around it so that no 
 one could see it was a tub and it stood on a very handsome carpet 
 how the trembled what was going to happen to him now some young ladies came and the servants helped them to adorn the tree 
 
 on one branch they hung little bags cut out of colored paper and each bag was filled with sweetmeats from other branches hung gilded apples and walnuts as if they had grown there and above and all round were hundreds of red blue and white tapers which were fastened on the branches dolls exactly like real babies were placed under the green leaves the tree had never seen such things before and at the very top was fastened a glittering star made of tinsel oh it was very beautiful 
 
 this evening they all exclaimed how bright it will be 
 oh that the evening were come thought the tree and the tapers 
 lighted then i shall know what else is going to happen will the 
 trees of the forest come to see me i wonder if the sparrows will peep 
 in at the windows as they fly shall i grow faster here and keep on 
 all these ornaments summer and winter but guessing was of very 
 little use it made his bark ache and this pain is as bad for a 
 slender as headache is for us at last the tapers were 
 lighted and then what a glistening blaze of light the tree presented 
 it trembled so with joy in all its branches that one of the candles 
 fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them help help 
 exclaimed the young ladies but there was no danger for they 
 quickly extinguished the fire after this the tree tried not to 
 tremble at all though the fire frightened him he was so anxious 
 not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments even while their 
 brilliancy dazzled him and now the folding doors were thrown open 
 and a troop of children rushed in as if they intended to upset the 
 tree they were followed more silently by their elders for a moment 
 the little ones stood silent with astonishment and then they 
 shouted for joy till the room rang and they danced merrily round the 
 tree while one present after another was taken from it 
 
 what are they doing what will happen next thought the fir 
 at last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put out 
 then the children received permission to plunder the tree 
 
 oh how they rushed upon it till the branches cracked and had it 
 not been fastened with the glistening star to the ceiling it must 
 have been thrown down the children then danced about with their 
 pretty toys and no one noticed the tree except the maid 
 who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten 
 
 a story a story cried the children pulling a little fat man 
 towards the tree 
 
 now we shall be in the green shade said the man as he seated 
 himself under it and the tree will have the pleasure of hearing 
 also but i shall only relate one story what shall it be 
 
 or humpty dumpty who fell down stairs but soon got up again and at last married a princess 
 
 cried some humpty dumpty cried others and 
 there was a fine shouting and crying out but the remained 
 quite still and thought to himself shall i have anything to do with 
 all this but he had already amused them as much as they wished 
 then the old man told them the story of humpty dumpty how he fell down stairs and was raised up again and married a princess and the 
 children clapped their hands and cried tell another tell another for they wanted to hear the story of but they only had humpty dumpty after this the became quite silent and thoughtful never had the birds in the forest told such tales as humpty dumpty who fell down stairs and yet married a 
 princess 
 
 ah yes so it happens in the world thought the he 
 believed it all because it was related by such a nice man ah 
 well he thought who knows perhaps i may fall down too and 
 marry a princess and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening 
 expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings gold 
 and fruit i will not tremble thought he i will enjoy 
 all my splendor and i shall hear the story of humpty dumpty again 
 and perhaps and the tree remained quiet and thoughtful all night in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in now thought the fir all my splendor is going to begin again but they dragged him out of the room and up stairs to the garret and threw him on the floor in a dark corner where no daylight shone and there they left him what does this mean thought the tree what am i to do here i can hear nothing in a place like this and he had time enough to think for days and nights passed and no one came near him and when at last somebody did come it was only to put away large boxes in a corner so the tree was completely hidden from sight as if it had never existed it is winter now thought the tree the ground is hard and covered with snow so that people cannot plant me i shall be sheltered here i dare say until spring comes 
 
 how thoughtful and kind everybody is to me still i wish this place 
 were not so dark as well as lonely with not even a little hare to 
 look at how pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow lay on 
 the ground when the hare would run by yes and jump over me too 
 although i did not like it then oh it is terrible lonely here 
 
 squeak squeak said a little mouse creeping cautiously towards 
 the tree then came another and they both sniffed at the and 
 crept between the branches 
 
 oh it is very cold said the little mouse or else we should 
 be so comfortable here we you old 
 i am not old said the there are many who are older 
 than i am 
 
 where do you come from and what do you know asked the were full of curiosity have you seen the most beautiful places in the world and can you tell us all about them and have you been in the storeroom where cheeses lie on the shelf and hams hang from the ceiling one can run about on tallow candles there and go in thin and come out fat 
 
 i know nothing of that place said the but i know the 
 wood where the sun shines and the birds sing and then the tree 
 told the little mice all about its youth they had never heard such an 
 account in their lives and after they had listened to it attentively 
 they said what a number of things you have seen you must have 
 been very happy 
 
 happy exclaimed the and then as he reflected upon 
 what he had been telling them he said ah yes after all those were 
 happy days but when he went on and related all about 
 and how he had been dressed up with cakes and mice said how happy you must have been you old 
 
 i am not old at all replied the tree i only came from the 
 forest this winter i am now checked in my growth 
 
 what splendid stories you can relate said the little mice 
 and the next night four other mice came with them to hear what the 
 tree had to tell the more he talked the more he remembered and 
 then he thought to himself those were happy days but they may 
 come again humpty dumpty fell down stairs and yet he married the 
 princess perhaps i may marry a princess too and the 
 thought of the pretty little that grew in the forest which 
 was to him a real beautiful princess 
 
 who is humpty dumpty asked the little mice and then the tree 
 related the whole story he could remember every single word and 
 the little mice was so delighted with it that they were ready to jump 
 to the top of the tree the next night a great many more mice made 
 their appearance and on sunday two rats came with them but they 
 said it was not a pretty story at all and the little mice were 
 very sorry for it made them also think less of it 
 
 do you know only one story asked the rats 
 
 only one replied the i heard it on the happiest 
 evening of my life but i did not know i was so happy at the time 
 
 we think it is a very miserable story said the rats you 
 know any story about bacon or tallow in the storeroom 
 
 no replied the tree 
 
 many thanks to you then replied the rats and they marched off 
 the little mice also kept away after this and the tree sighed 
 and said it was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat round 
 me and listened while i talked now that is all passed too however i 
 shall consider myself happy when some one comes to take me out of this place but would this ever happen yes one morning people came to clear out the garret the boxes were packed away and the tree was pulled out of the corner and thrown roughly on the garret floor then the servant dragged it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone now life is beginning again said the tree rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air then it was carried down stairs and 
 taken into the courtyard so quickly that it forgot to think of 
 itself and could only look about there was so much to be seen the 
 court was close to a garden where everything looked blooming fresh and fragrant roses hung over the little palings the were in blossom while the swallows flew here and there crying twit twit twit my mate is coming but it was not the they 
 meant now i shall live cried the tree joyfully spreading out 
 its branches but alas they were all withered and yellow and it 
 lay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles the star of gold paper 
 still stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine in 
 the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had 
 danced round the tree at christmas and had been so happy the 
 youngest saw the gilded star and ran and pulled it off the tree 
 look what is sticking to the ugly old said the child 
 treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots and the 
 tree saw all the fresh bright flowers in the garden and then looked 
 at itself and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the 
 garret it thought of its fresh youth in the forest of the merry 
 christmas evening and of the little mice who had listened to the 
 story of humpty dumpty past past said the old tree oh had 
 i but enjoyed myself while i could have done so but now it is too 
 late then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces till 
 a large bundle lay in a heap on the ground the pieces were placed 
 in a fire under the copper and they quickly blazed up brightly while 
 the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a 
 then the children who were at play came and seated themselves in 
 front of the fire and looked at it and cried pop pop but at each 
 pop which was a deep sigh the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest and of christmas evening and of humpty dumpty the only story it had ever heard or knew how to relate till at last it was 
 consumed the boys still played in the garden and the youngest wore 
 the golden star on his breast with which the tree had been adorned 
 during the happiest evening of its existence now all was past the 
 life was past and the story also for all stories must come 
 to an end at last 
 
 the end

 praise is the reflection of virtue but it is as the glass or body which giveth the 
 reflection if it be from the common people it is commonly false and naught and 
 rather followeth vain persons than virtuous for the common people understand not many excellent virtues the lowest virtues draw praise from them the middle virtues work in them astonishment or admiration but of the highest virtues they have no sense or perceiving at all but shows and speciesvirtutibus arnues serve best with them 
 certainly fame is like a river that beareth up things light and swollen and 
 drowns things weighty and solid but if persons of quality and judgement concur then it is as the scripture saith nomen bonwn mstar unguentifragrontis it fillelh all 
 round about and will not easily away for me odours of ointments are more durable than those of flowers there be so many false points of praise that a man may justly hold it a suspect some praises proceed merely of flattery and if he be an ordinary flatterer he will have certain common attributes which may serve every man if he be a cunning flatterer he will follow the which is a self and wherein a man thinketh that of himself therein the flatterer will uphold him 
 most but if he be an impudent flatterer look wherein a man is conscious to himself 
 that he is most defective and is most out of countenance in himself that will the 
 flatterer entitle him to perforce spretaconsdentia some praises come of good 
 wishes and respects which is a form due in civility to kings and great persons

 some men are praised maliciously to their hurt thereby to stir envy and jealousy towards them pesswiwn genus inmvcomm hudanlaan in so much as it was a proverb amongst the grecians that he that was praised to his hurt should have a push rise upon his nose as we say that a blister will rise upon tongue that tells a lie 
 certainly moderate praise used with opportunity and not vulgar is that which doth the good solomon saith he that praiseth his friend aloud rising early it shall be to him no better than a curse too much magnifying of man or matter doth irritate contradiction and procure envy and scorn to praise a self cannot 
 be decent except it be in rare cases but to praise a office or profession 
 he may do it with good grace and with a kind of magnanimity 
 the cardinals of rome which are theologues and friars and schoolmen have a phrase of notable contempt and scorn towards civil business for they call all temporal business of wars embassages judicature and other employments sbarene which is as if they were but matters for and catohpoles though many times those do more good than their high speculations st paul when he boasts of himself he doth oft interlace i speak like a fool but speaking of his calling he saith

 book descent 
 chapter xiii 
 
 the solution of some questions connected with the municipal police 
 javert thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him she yielded mechanically 
 neither he nor she uttered a word the cloud of spectators followed jesting in a paroxysm of delight supreme misery an occasion for obscenity 
 on arriving at the police station which was a low room warmed by a stove with a glazed and grated door opening on the street and guarded by a detachment javert opened the door entered with fantine and shut the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who raised themselves on tiptoe and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the in their effort to see curiosity is a sort of gluttony 
 to see is to devour 
 on entering fantine fell down in a corner motionless and mute crouching down like a terrified dog 
 the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table javert seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began to write 
 this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police 
 the latter do what they please punish them as seems good to them and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty javert was impassive his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever nevertheless he was seriously and deeply preoccupied 
 it was one of those moments when he was exercising without control but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience his redoubtable discretionary power 
 at that moment he was conscious that his police stool was a tribunal 
 he was entering judgment he judged and condemned 
 he summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing the more he examined the deed of this woman the more shocked he felt it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime he had just beheld yonder in the street society in the person of a freeholder and an elector insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales 
 a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen 
 he had seen that he javert 
 he wrote in silence 
 when he had finished he signed the paper folded it and said to the sergeant of the guard as he handed it to him take three men and conduct this creature to jail 
 then turning to fantine you are to have six months of it the unhappy woman shuddered 
 six months six months of prison she exclaimed 
 six months in which to earn seven sous a day 
 but what will become of cosette my daughter my daughter 
 but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs do you know that monsieur inspector 
 she dragged herself across the damp floor among the muddy boots of all those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides on her knees 
 monsieur javert said she i beseech your mercy 
 i assure you that i was not in the wrong 
 if you had seen the beginning you would have seen 
 i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame 
 that gentleman the bourgeois whom i do not know put snow in my back 
 has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably and doing no harm to any one i am rather ill as you see 
 and then he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time 
 you are ugly you have no teeth i know well that i have no longer those teeth 
 i did nothing i said to myself the gentleman is amusing himself 
 i was honest with him i did not speak to him 
 it was at that moment that he put the snow down my back 
 monsieur javert good monsieur inspector is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true 
 perhaps i did wrong to get angry you know that one is not master of self at the first moment one gives way to vivacity and then when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it 
 i did wrong to spoil that hat 
 why did he go away 
 i would ask his pardon 
 oh my god 
 it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon 
 do me the favor for this once monsieur javert hold you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day it is not the fault but seven sous is earnings and just fancy i must pay one hundred francs or my little girl will be sent to me 
 oh my god 
 i cannot have her with me what i do is so vile 
 oh my cosette 
 oh my little angel of the holy virgin what will become of her poor creature 
 i will tell you it is the thenardiers peasants and such people are unreasonable 
 they want money 
 put me in prison you see there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may in the very heart of the winter and you must have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert if she were older she might earn her living but it cannot be done at that age 
 i am not a bad woman at bottom 
 it is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what i am 
 if i have drunk brandy it was out of misery 
 i do not love it but it benumbs the senses when i was happy it was only necessary to glance into my closets and it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and untidy woman 
 i had linen a great deal of linen 
 have pity on me monsieur javert 
 she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with sobs blinded with tears her neck bare wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short cough stammering softly with a voice of agony 
 great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray which transfigures the unhappy at that moment fantine had become beautiful once more 
 from time to time she paused and tenderly kissed the police coat she would have softened a heart of granite but a heart of wood cannot be softened 
 come said javert i have heard you out 
 have you entirely finished you will get six months 
 now march 
 the eternal father in person could do nothing more 
 at these solemn words the eternal father in person could do nothing more she understood that her fate was sealed she sank down murmuring mercy 
 javert turned his back 
 the soldiers seized her by the arms 
 a few moments earlier a man had entered but no one had paid any heed to him 
 he shut the door leaned his back against it and listened to despairing supplications 
 at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said 
 one moment if you please 
 javert raised his eyes and recognized m madeleine 
 he removed his hat and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness 
 excuse me mr mayor 
 the words mr mayor produced a curious effect upon fantine she rose to her feet with one bound like a spectre springing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up to m madeleine before any one could prevent her and gazing intently at him with a bewildered air she cried 
 ah so it is you who are m le maire 
 then she burst into a laugh and spit in his face 
 m madeleine wiped his face and said 
 inspector javert set this woman at liberty 
 javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad 
 he experienced at that moment blow upon blow and almost simultaneously the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life to see a woman of the town spit in the face was a thing so monstrous that in his most daring flights of fancy he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible on the other hand at the very bottom of his thought he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was and as to what this mayor might be and then he with horror caught a glimpse of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack but when he beheld that mayor that magistrate calmly wipe his face and say set this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement thought and word failed him equally the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case he remained mute 
 the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantine she raised her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stove like a person who is reeling 
 nevertheless she glanced about her and began to speak in a low voice as though talking to herself 
 at liberty 
 i am to be allowed to go 
 i am not to go to prison for six months 
 who said that 
 it is not possible that any one could have said that 
 i did not hear aright 
 it cannot have been that monster of a mayor 
 was it you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be set free 
 oh see here 
 i will tell you about it and you will let me go 
 that monster of a mayor that old blackguard of a mayor is the cause of all 
 just imagine monsieur javert he turned me out all because of a pack of rascally women who gossip in the workroom 
 if that is not a horror what is 
 to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly then i could no longer earn enough and all this misery followed in the first place there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make and that is to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people 
 i will explain it to you you see 
 you are earning twelve sous at the price falls to nine sous and it is not enough to live on then one has to become whatever one can 
 as for me i had my little cosette and i was actually forced to become a bad woman now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief 
 after that i stamped on that hat in front of the officers cafe but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow 
 we women have but one silk dress for evening wear you see that i did not do wrong monsieur javert and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i and who are much happier 
 o monsieur javert it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free was it not 
 make inquiries speak to my landlord i am paying my rent now they will tell you that i am perfectly honest 
 ah my god 
 i beg your pardon i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke 
 m madeleine listened to her with profound attention 
 while she was speaking he fumbled in his waistcoat drew out his purse and opened it 
 it was empty 
 he put it back in his pocket he said to fantine how much did you say that you owed 
 fantine who was looking at javert only turned towards him 
 was i speaking to you 
 then addressing the soldiers 
 say you fellows did you see how i spit in his face ah you old wretch of a mayor you came here to frighten me but not afraid of you 
 i am afraid of monsieur javert i am afraid of my good monsieur javert 
 so saying she turned to the inspector again 
 and yet you see mr inspector it is necessary to be just i understand that you are just mr inspector in fact it is perfectly simple 
 a man amuses himself by putting snow down a back and that makes the officers laugh one must divert themselves in some way and we are here for them to amuse themselves with of course 
 and then you you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order you lead off the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you are a good man you say that i am to be set at liberty it is for the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child only do it again you hussy 
 oh 
 i do it again monsieur javert 
 they may do whatever they please to me now i will not stir 
 but you see i cried because it hurt me i was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all and then as i told you i am not well i have a cough i seem to have a burning ball in my stomach and the doctor tells me take care of yourself 
 here feel give me your hand be afraid it is here 
 she no longer wept her voice was caressing she placed coarse hand on her delicate white throat and looked smilingly at him 
 all at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments dropped the folds of her skirt which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along almost to the height of her knee and stepped towards the door saying to the soldiers in a low voice and with a friendly nod 
 children monsieur has said that i am to be released and i am going 
 she laid her hand on the latch of the door 
 one step more and she would be in the street 
 javert up to that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere 
 the sound of the latch roused him 
 he raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level ferocious in the wild beast atrocious in the man of no estate 
 sergeant he cried you see that that jade is walking off who bade you let her go 
 i said madeleine 
 fantine trembled at the sound of voice and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen at the sound of voice she turned around and from that moment forth she uttered no word nor dared so much as to breathe freely but her glance strayed from madeleine to javert and from javert to madeleine in turn according to which was speaking 
 it was evident that javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done after the suggestion that fantine should be set at liberty 
 had he reached the point of forgetting the presence 
 had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending it 
 or in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours did he say to himself that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions that it was indispensable that the small should be made great that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice and that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government society in its entirety was personified in him javert 
 however that may be when m madeleine uttered that word i as we have just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor pale cold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and say to him with downcast eyes but a firm voice 
 mr mayor that cannot be 
 why not said m madeleine 
 this miserable woman has insulted a citizen 
 inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and conciliating tone listen 
 you are an honest man and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you 
 here is the true state of the case i was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away there were still groups of people standing about and i made inquiries and learned everything it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police 
 javert retorted 
 this wretch has just insulted monsieur le maire 
 that concerns me said m madeleine 
 my own insult belongs to me i think 
 i can do what i please about it 
 i beg monsieur le pardon 
 the insult is not to him but to the law 
 inspector javert replied m madeleine the highest law is conscience 
 i have heard this woman i know what i am doing 
 and i mr mayor do not know what i see 
 then content yourself with obeying 
 i am obeying my duty 
 my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison 
 m madeleine replied gently 
 heed this well she will not serve a single day 
 at this decisive word javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful 
 i am sorry to oppose monsieur le maire it is for the first time in my life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority 
 i confine myself since monsieur le maire desires it to the question of the gentleman 
 i was present this woman flung herself on monsieur bamatabnois who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cut stone 
 such things as there are in the world in any case monsieur le maire this is a question of police regulations in the streets and concerns me and i shall detain this woman fantine 
 then m madeleine folded his arms and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto 
 the matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police 
 according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and of the code of criminal examination i am the judge 
 i order that this woman shall be set at liberty 
 javert ventured to make a final effort 
 but mr mayor 
 i refer you to article of the law of the th of december in regard to arbitrary detention 
 monsieur le maire permit me 
 not another word 
 but 
 leave the room said m madeleine 
 javert received the blow erect full in the face in his breast like a russian soldier 
 he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room 
 fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed 
 nevertheless she also was the prey to a strange confusion 
 she had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers she had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty her life her soul her child in combat before her very eyes one of these men was drawing her towards darkness the other was leading her back towards the light 
 in this conflict viewed through the exaggerations of terror these two men had appeared to her like two giants the one spoke like her demon the other like her good angel the angel had conquered the demon and strange to say that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man whom she abhorred that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes that madeleine and at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion he had saved her 
 had she then been mistaken must she change her whole soul 
 she did not know she trembled she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and at every word uttered by m madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her and something warm and ineffable indescribable which was both joy confidence and love dawn in her heart 
 when javert had taken his departure m madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking 
 i have heard you 
 i knew nothing about what you have mentioned i believe that it is true and i feel that it is true 
 i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop 
 why did you not apply to me 
 but here i will pay your debts i will send for your child or you shall go to her 
 you shall live here in paris or where you please 
 i undertake the care of your child and yourself 
 you shall not work any longer if you do not like 
 i will give all the money you require 
 you shall be honest and happy once more 
 and listen i declare to you that if all is as you i do not doubt it you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of god oh poor woman 
 this was more than fantine could bear 
 to have cosette 
 to leave this life of infamy 
 to live free rich happy respectable with cosette to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery 
 she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her and could only give vent to two or three sobs oh 
 oh 
 oh 
 her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m madeleine and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it 
 then she fainted

 book three 
 chapter iv 
 
 when princess mary came down prince vasili and his son were already in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess indicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince face serious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on the visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasili approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still could not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all anatole was not nor ready or eloquent in conversation but he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable if a man lacking in remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly examined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him talk but i want to he seemed to say besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even love a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was was as if he said to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think this when he met women even probably he did not for in general he thought very little but his looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation was general and animated thanks to princess voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some jokes and amusing reminiscences though no such reminiscences really exist just as none existed in this case prince vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences 
 here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in french to prince vasili not as at receptions where you always ran away you remember cette chere annette 
 anna pavlovna 
 ah but you talk politics to me like annette 
 and our little tea table 
 oh yes 
 why is it you were never at the little princess asked anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger at him i have even heard of your doings in paris 
 and hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning to his son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary 
 when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections 
 she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when married la petite est gentille 
 the little one is charming 
 the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are prince vasili and that son of his to me prince vasili is a shallow braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain lise married to andrew a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays but is she contented with her lot and who would marry marie for love plain and awkward take her for her connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while dressing and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer prince vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer his birth and position in society were not bad well nothing against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her and that is what we shall see 
 that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloud 
 he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress mademoiselle ribbon princess unbecoming coiffure mademoiselle and smiles and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a fool he thought looking irritably at her she is shameless and he ignores her 
 he went straight up to prince vasili 
 well how do how do glad to see you 
 friendship laughs at distance began prince vasili in his usual rapid familiar tone here is my second son please love and befriend him 
 prince bolkonski surveyed anatole 
 fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and kiss me and he offered his cheek 
 anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect 
 prince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princess mary 
 and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating prince last words then rising he suddenly went up to his daughter 
 is it for visitors got yourself up like that eh said he fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent 
 it was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with a blush 
 you must do as you please said prince bolkonski bowing to his but she need not make a fool of herself plain enough as it is 
 and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was reduced to tears 
 on the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said prince vasili 
 now you young prince your name said prince bolkonski turning to anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted 
 now the fun begins thought anatole sitting down with a smile beside the old prince 
 well my dear boy i hear been educated abroad not taught to read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me my dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the old man scrutinizing anatole closely and intently 
 no i have been transferred to the line said anatole hardly able to restrain his laughter 
 ah a good thing so my dear boy you wish to serve the tsar and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow must serve well are you off to the front 
 no prince our regiment has gone to the front but i am attached what is it i am attached to papa said anatole turning to his father with a laugh 
 a splendid soldier splendid what am i attached to ha ha ha laughed prince bolkonski and anatole laughed still louder suddenly prince bolkonski frowned 
 you may go he said to anatole 
 anatole returned smiling to the ladies 
 and so had him educated abroad prince vasili you said the old prince to prince vasili 
 i have done my best for him and i can assure you the education there is much better than ours 
 yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed the a fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now he took prince arm and led him to his study as soon as they were alone together prince vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince 
 well do you think i shall prevent her that i part from her said the old prince angrily what an idea ready for it tomorrow only let me tell you i want to know my better you know my principles everything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow in your presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay and see the old prince snorted let her marry all the same to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son 
 i will tell you frankly said prince vasili in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so companion you know you see right through people anatole is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son or kinsman 
 all right all right see 
 as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society on appearance all the three women of prince household felt that their life had not been real till then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance 
 princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly and magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and tried to conceal them 
 but am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do not like him 
 and princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new guest poor girl devilish ugly thought anatole 
 mademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young woman without any definite position without relations or even a country did not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski to reading aloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoiselle bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed ungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her off and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she liked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had been seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince had appeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle head at the very time she was talking to anatole about paris it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar to her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible 
 the little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any struggle but with naive and lighthearted gaiety 
 although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women besides that he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions 
 after tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spirits came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoiselle bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her but to the movements of mademoiselle little foot which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess 
 how she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband can it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face but still feeling his eyes gazing at her 
 in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole kissed princess hand she did not know how she found the courage but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle hand this was not etiquette but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle bourienne flushed and gave the princess a frightened look 
 what delicacy thought the princess is it possible that amelie mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her and not value her pure affection and devotion to me she went up to her and kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand 
 no no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the flax 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the flax was in full bloom it had pretty little blue flowers as 
 delicate as the wings of a moth or even more so the sun shone and 
 the showers watered it and this was just as good for the flax as it 
 is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mother 
 they look much prettier for it and so did the flax 
 
 people say that i look exceedingly well said the flax and 
 that i am so fine and long that i shall make a beautiful piece of 
 linen how fortunate i am it makes me so happy it is such a pleasant 
 thing to know that something can be made of me how the sunshine 
 cheers me and how sweet and refreshing is the rain my happiness 
 overpowers me no one in the world can feel happier than i am 
 
 ah yes no doubt said the fern but you do not know the world 
 yet as well as i do for my sticks are knotty and then it sung quite 
 mournfully 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lurre 
 the song is ended 
 no it is not ended said the flax the sun will 
 shine or the rain descend i feel that i am growing i feel that i am 
 in full blossom i am the happiest of all creatures 
 
 well one day some people came who took hold of the flax and 
 pulled it up by the roots this was painful then it was laid in water 
 as if they intended to drown it and after that placed near a fire 
 as if it were to be roasted all this was very shocking we cannot 
 expect to be happy always said the flax by experiencing evil as 
 well as good we become wise and certainly there was plenty of 
 evil in store for the flax it was steeped and roasted and broken 
 and combed indeed it scarcely knew what was done to it at last it 
 was put on the spinning wheel whirr whirr went the wheel so 
 quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts well i have 
 been very happy he thought in the midst of his pain and must be 
 contented with the past and contented he remained till he was put on 
 the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen all the flax 
 even to the last stalk was used in making this one piece well this 
 is quite wonderful i could not have believed that i should be so 
 favored by fortune the fern was not wrong with its song of 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lurre 
 but the song is not ended yet i am sure it is only just beginning 
 how wonderful it is that after all i have suffered i am made 
 something of at last i am the luckiest person in the world so strong 
 and fine and how white and what a length this is something 
 different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers then i had no 
 attention nor any water unless it rained now i am watched and taken 
 care of every morning the maid turns me over and i have a 
 from the every evening yes and the 
 wife noticed me and said i was the best piece of linen in 
 the whole parish i cannot be happier than i am now 
 
 after some time the linen was taken into the house placed 
 under the scissors and cut and torn into pieces and then pricked 
 with needles this certainly was not pleasant but at last it was made 
 into twelve garments of that kind which people do not like to name 
 and yet everybody should wear one see now then said the flax i have become something of importance this was my destiny it is 
 quite a blessing now i shall be of some use in the world as everyone 
 ought to be it is the only way to be happy i am now divided into 
 twelve pieces and yet we are all one and the same in the whole dozen 
 it is most extraordinary good fortune 
 
 years passed away and at last the linen was so worn it could 
 scarcely hold together it must end very soon said the pieces to 
 each other we would gladly have held together a little longer but 
 it is useless to expect impossibilities and at length they fell into 
 rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them for they were 
 torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried 
 and they knew not what besides till all at once they found themselves 
 beautiful white paper well now this is a surprise a glorious 
 surprise too said the paper i am now finer than ever and i 
 shall be written upon and who can tell what fine things i may have 
 written upon me this is wonderful luck and sure enough the most 
 beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it and only once was 
 there a blot which was very fortunate then people heard the 
 stories and poetry read and it made them wiser and better for all 
 that was written had a good and sensible meaning and a great blessing was contained in the words on this paper 
 
 i never imagined anything like this said the paper when i was 
 only a little blue flower growing in the fields how could i fancy 
 that i should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to 
 man i cannot understand it myself and yet it is really so heaven 
 knows that i have done nothing myself but what i was obliged to do 
 with my weak powers for my own preservation and yet i have been 
 promoted from one joy and honor to another each time i think that the song is ended and then something higher and better begins for me i suppose now i shall be sent on my travels about the world so that people may read me it cannot be otherwise indeed it is more than probable for i have more splendid thoughts written upon me than i had pretty flowers in olden times i am happier than ever 
 
 but the paper did not go on its travels it was sent to the 
 printer and all the words written upon it were set up in type to 
 make a book or rather many hundreds of books for so many more 
 persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than 
 from the written paper and if the paper had been sent around the 
 world it would have been worn out before it had got half through 
 its journey 
 
 this is certainly the wisest plan said the written paper i 
 really did not think of that i shall remain at home and be held in 
 honor like some old grandfather as i really am to all these new 
 books they will do some good i could not have wandered about as they do yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface i am the most honored of all 
 
 then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and 
 thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse 
 
 after work it is well to rest said the paper and a very good 
 opportunity to collect thoughts now i am able for the first 
 time to think of my real condition and to know self is true 
 progress what will be done with me now i wonder no doubt i shall still go forward i have always progressed hitherto as i know quite well 
 
 now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken 
 out and laid on the hearth to be burnt people said it could not be 
 sold at the shop to wrap up butter and sugar because it had been 
 written upon the children in the house stood round the stove for 
 they wanted to see the paper burn because it flamed up so prettily 
 and afterwards among the ashes so many red sparks could be seen 
 running one after the other here and there as quick as the wind 
 
 they called it seeing the children come out of school and the last 
 spark was the schoolmaster they often thought the last spark had 
 come and one would cry there goes the schoolmaster but the next moment another spark would appear shining so beautifully how they would like to know where the sparks all went to perhaps we shall find out some day but we know now 
 
 the whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was 
 soon alight ugh cried the paper as it burst into a bright 
 flame ugh it was certainly not very pleasant to be burning but 
 when the whole was wrapped in flames the flames mounted up into the air higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little 
 blue flower and they glistened as the white linen never could have 
 glistened all the written letters became quite red in a moment and 
 all the words and thoughts turned to fire 
 
 now i am mounting straight up to the sun said a voice in the 
 flames and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words and the 
 flames darted up through the chimney and went out at the top then 
 a number of tiny beings as many in number as the flowers on the 
 flax had been and invisible to mortal eyes floated above them 
 
 they were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from which 
 they were born and as the flames were extinguished and nothing 
 remained of the paper but black ashes these little beings danced upon 
 it and whenever they touched it bright red sparks appeared 
 
 the children are all out of school and the schoolmaster was 
 the last of all said the children it was good fun and they sang 
 over the dead ashes 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lure 
 the song is ended 
 but the little invisible beings said the song is never ended 
 the most beautiful is yet to come 
 
 but the children could neither hear nor understand this nor 
 should they for children must not know everything

 of vainglory 
 it was prettily devised of aesop the fly sat upon the of the chariot wheel 
 and said what a dust do i raise 
 so are there some vain persons that whatsoever goeth alone or moveth upon greater means if they have never so little hand in it they think it is they that carry it they that are glorious must needs be factious for all bravery stands upon comparisons they must needs be violent to make good their own vaunts neither can they be secret and therefore not effectual but according to die french proverb beaucoup de bruit peu de fruit much bruit little fruit yet certainly there is use of this quality in civil affairs 
 where there is an opinion and fame to be created either of virtue or greatness these men are good trumpeters again as titus livius noteth in the case of antiochus and the aetolians there are sometimes great effects of cross lies as if a man that negotiates between two princes to draw them to join in a war against the third doth extol the forces of either of them above measure the one to the other and sometimes he that deals between man and man raiseth his own credit with both by pretending greater interest than he hath in either and in these and the like kinds it often falls out that somewhat is produced of nothing for lies are sufficient to breed opinion and opinion brings on substance in military commanders and soldiers vainglory is an essential point for as iron sharpens iron so by glory one courage sharpeneth another in cases of great enterprise upon charge and adventure a composition of glorious natures doth put life into business and those mat are of solid and sober natures have more of the ballast than of the sail in fame of learning the flight will be slow without some feathers of ostentation qui de contenmenda gloria libros scribunt nomen suum inscribunt socrates aristotle galen were men firil of ostentation 
 certainly vainglory helpeth to perpetuate a memory and virtue was never so beholding to human nature as it received his due at the second hand neither had the fame of cicero seneca plinius secundus borne her age so well if it had not been joined with some vanity in themselves like unto varnish that makes sealings not only shine but last but all this while when i speak of vainglory i mean not of that property that tacitus doth attribute to mucianus omnium quae chxerat jeceratque arte quadam ostentator for that proceeds not of vanity but of natural magnanimity and discretion and in some persons is not only comely but gracious 
 for excusations cessions modesty itself well governed are but arts of ostentation and amongst those arts there is none better than that which plinius secundus speaketh of which is to be liberal of praise and commendation to others in that wherein a self hath any perfection for saith pliny very wittily in commending another you do your self right for he that you commend is either superior to you in that you commend or inferior 
 
 if he be inferior if he be to be commended you much more if he be superior if 
 he be not to be commended you much less glorious men are the scorn of wise men the admiration of fools the idols of parasites and the slaves of their own vaunts

 chapter i 
 
 the beginning of repose 
 m madeleine had fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house 
 he confided her to the sisters who put her to bed 
 a burning fever had come on 
 she passed a part of the night in delirium and raving 
 at length however she fell asleep 
 on the morrow towards midday fantine awoke 
 she heard some one breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and saw m madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head his gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication 
 she followed its direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall 
 thenceforth m madeleine was transfigured in eyes 
 he seemed to her to be clothed in light 
 he was absorbed in a sort of prayer she gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him at last she said timidly 
 what are you doing 
 m madeleine had been there for an hour 
 he had been waiting for fantine to awake 
 he took her hand felt of her pulse and replied 
 how do you feel 
 well i have slept she replied i think that i am better it is nothing 
 he answered responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it 
 i was praying to the martyr there on high 
 and he added in his own mind for the martyr here below 
 m madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries 
 he knew all now he knew history in all its details 
 he went on 
 you have suffered much poor mother 
 oh do not complain you now have the dowry of the elect 
 it is thus that men are transformed into angels 
 it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise 
 you see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven 
 it was necessary to begin there 
 he sighed deeply 
 but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking 
 that same night javert wrote a letter 
 the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m sur m it was addressed to paris and the superscription ran 
 to monsieur chabouillet secretary of monsieur le prefet of police 
 as the affair in the had been bruited about the and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off and who recognized handwriting on the cover thought that he was sending in his resignation 
 made haste to write to the thenardiers 
 fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs 
 he sent them three hundred francs telling them to pay themselves from that sum and to fetch the child instantly to m sur m where her sick mother required her presence 
 this dazzled thenardier 
 the devil said the man to his wife allow the child to go 
 this lark is going to turn into a milch cow 
 i see through it 
 some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother 
 he replied with a very well bill for five hundred and some odd francs 
 in this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred for the doctor the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked eponine and azelma through two long illnesses 
 cosette as we have already said had not been ill it was only a question of a trifling substitution of names at the foot of the memorandum thenardier wrote received on account three hundred francs 
 m madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote make haste to bring cosette 
 christi said thenardier not give up the child 
 in the meantime fantine did not recover 
 she still remained in the infirmary 
 the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman with repugnance 
 those who have seen the of rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins 
 the ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion 
 but in a few days fantine disarmed them she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness 
 one day the sisters heard her say amid her fever 
 i have been a sinner but when i have my child beside me it will be a sign that god has pardoned me while i was leading a bad life i should not have liked to have my cosette with me i could not have borne her sad astonished eyes it was for her sake that i did evil and that is why god pardons me i shall feel the benediction of the good god when cosette is here i shall gaze at her it will do me good to see that innocent creature she knows nothing at all 
 she is an angel you see my sisters at that age the wings have not fallen off 
 m madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him 
 shall i see my cosette soon 
 he answered 
 perhaps 
 she may arrive at any moment 
 i am expecting her 
 and the pale face grew radiant 
 oh she said how happy i am going to be 
 we have just said that she did not recover her health 
 on the contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last at that time people were beginning to follow the fine fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies the doctor sounded chest and shook his head 
 m madeleine said to the doctor 
 well 
 has she not a child which she desires to see said the doctor 
 yes 
 well 
 make haste and get it here 
 
 m madeleine shuddered 
 fantine inquired 
 what did the doctor say 
 m madeleine forced himself to smile 
 he said that your child was to be brought speedily 
 that that would restore your health 
 oh she rejoined he is right 
 but what do those thenardiers mean by keeping my cosette from me 
 oh she is coming 
 at last i behold happiness close beside me 
 in the meantime thenardier did not let go of the child and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it 
 cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter 
 and then there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood and they were collecting the bills for them etc etc 
 i shall send some one to fetch cosette said father madeleine if necessary i will go myself 
 he wrote the following letter to dictation and made her sign it 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 in the meantime a serious incident occurred 
 carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it

 book three 
 chapter v 
 
 they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed all kept awake a long time that night 
 is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes kind that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner and this someone was he the devil and he was also this man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips 
 she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room 
 mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall 
 the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time muttering to herself 
 i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated i should be glad enough to fall asleep so not my fault and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry 
 the old prince did not sleep either tikhon half asleep heard him pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but instead of that he only excited himself more and more 
 the first man that turns up she forgets her father and everything else runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice it fr fr fr and i see that that idiot had eyes only for bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but let her see 
 the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne princess would be wounded and his point not to be parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this thought he called tikhon and began to undress 
 what devil brought them here thought he while tikhon was putting the nightshirt over his old body and chest i never invited them they came to disturb my life and there is not much of it left 
 devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the shirt 
 tikhon knew his habit of sometimes thinking aloud and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt 
 gone to bed asked the prince 
 tikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince vasili and his son 
 they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency 
 no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he went to the couch on which he slept 
 though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary went to her room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne and anatole met in the conservatory 
 princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it she read this in face and in that of prince valet who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water 
 the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking expression of her his face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her repeating in a low voice the same words several times over 
 he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously 
 i have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an unnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasili has not come and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince bolkonski referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyes last night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know my principles i refer it to you 
 how am i to understand you mon pere said the princess growing pale and then blushing 
 how understand me cried her father angrily prince vasili finds you to his taste as a and makes a proposal to you on his behalf how to be understood how understand it and i ask you 
 i do not know what you think father whispered the princess 
 i i what of me leave me out of the question not going to get married what about you what i want to know 
 the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to submit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if i had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the old prince interrupted her 
 admirable he shouted he will take you with your dowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain be the wife while you 
 the prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears 
 now then now then only joking he said remember this princess i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose i give you freedom only remember that your happiness depends on your decision never mind me 
 but i do not know father 
 no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry you or anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it over and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no i know you will pray over it well pray if you like but you had better think it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted when the princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the study 
 her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing anything when suddenly the whispering of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with a horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle bourienne who had not yet seen her 
 that why wait a moment face seemed to say princess mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it at last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments 
 an hour later tikhon came to call princess mary to the old prince he added that prince vasili was also there when tikhon came to her princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle pretty face 
 no princess i have lost your affection forever said mademoiselle bourienne 
 why i love you more than ever said princess mary and i will try to do all i can for your happiness 
 but you despise me you who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion oh only my poor mother 
 i quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile calm yourself my dear i will go to my father she said and went out 
 prince vasili with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as if stirred to his core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff 
 ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both hands then sighing he added my fate is in your hands decide my dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a daughter 
 he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye 
 fr fr snorted prince bolkonski the prince is making a proposition to you in his i mean his name do you wish or not to be prince anatole wife reply yes or no he shouted and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also yes my opinion and only my opinion added prince bolkonski turning to prince vasili and answering his imploring look yes or no 
 my desire is never to leave you father never to separate my life from yours i wish to marry she answered positively glancing at prince vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes 
 humbug nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolkonski frowning and taking his hand he did not kiss her but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry 
 prince vasili rose 
 my dear i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never never forget but my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so long say perhaps 
 prince what i have said is all there is in my heart i thank you for the honor but i shall never be your wife 
 well so finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have seen you very glad go back to your rooms princess go said the old prince very very glad to glad to have seen you repeated he embracing prince vasili 
 my vocation is a different one thought princess mary my vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of love and and cost what it may i will arrange poor happiness she loves him so passionately and so passionately repents i will do all i can to arrange the match between them if he is not rich i will give her the means i will ask my father and andrew i shall be so happy when she is his wife she is so unfortunate a stranger alone helpless and oh god how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself perhaps i might have done the same thought princess mary

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the flying trunk 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street with gold and would even then have had enough for a small alley but he did not do so he knew the value of money better than to use it in this way so clever was he that every shilling he put out brought him a crown and so he continued till he died his son inherited his wealth and he lived a merry life with it he went to a masquerade every night made kites out of five pound notes and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones making ducks and drakes of them in this manner he soon lost all his money 
 at last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers an old and four shillings and now all his friends deserted him they could not walk with him in the streets but one of them who was very 
 sent him an old trunk with this message pack up 
 yes he said it is all very well to say pack up but he had 
 nothing left to pack up therefore he seated himself in the trunk 
 it was a very wonderful trunk no sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly he shut the lid and pressed the lock when away flew the trunk up the chimney with the son in it right up into the clouds whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked he was in a great fright for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees however he got safely in his trunk to the land of turkey he hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves and then went into the town he could so this very well for the turks always go about dressed in and slippers as he was himself he happened to meet a nurse with a little child i say you turkish nurse cried he what castle is that near the town with the windows placed so high 
 
 the daughter lives there she replied it has been 
 prophesied that she will be very unhappy about a lover and 
 therefore no one is allowed to visit her unless the king and queen 
 are present 
 
 thank you said the son so he went back to the wood 
 seated himself in his trunk flew up to the roof of the castle and 
 crept through the window into the room she lay on the sofa asleep and she was so beautiful that the son could not help kissing her then she awoke and was very much frightened but he told her he was a turkish angel who had come down through the air to see her which pleased her very much he sat down by her side and talked to her he said her eyes were like beautiful dark lakes in which the thoughts swam about like little mermaids and he told her 
 that her forehead was a snowy mountain which contained splendid halls full of pictures and then he related to her about the stork who 
 brings the beautiful children from the rivers these were delightful 
 stories and when he asked the princess if she would marry him she 
 consented immediately 
 
 but you must come on saturday she said for then the king 
 and queen will take tea with me they will be very proud when they 
 find that i am going to marry a turkish angel but you must think of 
 some very pretty stories to tell them for my parents like to hear 
 stories better than anything my mother prefers one that is deep and 
 moral but my father likes something funny to make him laugh 
 
 very well he replied i shall bring you no other marriage 
 portion than a story and so they parted but the princess gave him a 
 sword which was studded with gold coins and these he could use 
 then he flew away to the town and bought a new 
 and afterwards returned to the wood where he composed a story so 
 as to be ready for saturday which was no easy matter it was ready 
 however by saturday when he went to see the princess the king and queen and the whole court were at tea with the princess and he 
 was received with great politeness 
 
 will you tell us a story said the queen one that is 
 instructive and full of deep learning 
 
 yes but with something in it to laugh at said the king 
 
 certainly he replied and commenced at once asking them to 
 listen attentively there was once a bundle of matches that were 
 exceedingly proud of their high descent their genealogical tree that 
 is a large from which they had been cut was at one time 
 a large old tree in the wood the matches now lay between a 
 and an old iron saucepan and were talking about their 
 youthful days ah then we grew on the green boughs and were as 
 green as they every morning and evening we were fed with diamond 
 drops of dew whenever the sun shone we felt his warm rays and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung we knew that 
 we were rich for the other trees only wore their green dress in 
 summer but our family were able to array themselves in green 
 summer and winter but the came like a great 
 revolution and our family fell under the axe the head of the house 
 obtained a situation as mainmast in a very fine ship and can sail 
 round the world when he will the other branches of the family were 
 taken to different places and our office now is to kindle a light for 
 common people this is how such people as we came to be in a kitchen 
 
 mine has been a very different fate said the iron pot which 
 stood by the matches from my first entrance into the world i have 
 been used to cooking and scouring i am the first in this house 
 when anything solid or useful is required my only pleasure is to be 
 made clean and shining after dinner and to sit in my place and have a 
 little sensible conversation with my neighbors all of us excepting 
 the which is sometimes taken into the courtyard live 
 here together within these four walls we get our news from the 
 but he sometimes tells us very unpleasant things 
 about the people and the government yes and one day an old pot was so alarmed that he fell down and was broken to pieces he was a liberal i can tell you 
 
 you are talking too much said the and the steel 
 struck against the flint till some sparks flew out crying we want a 
 merry evening we 
 
 yes of course said the matches let us talk about those 
 who are the highest born 
 
 no i like to be always talking of what we are remarked the saucepan let us think of some other amusement i will begin we will tell something that has happened to ourselves that will be very easy and interesting as well on the baltic sea near the danish shore 
 
 what a pretty commencement said the plates we shall all 
 like that story i am sure 
 
 yes well in my youth i lived in a quiet family where the 
 furniture was polished the floors scoured and clean curtains put 
 up every fortnight 
 
 what an interesting way you have of relating a story said 
 the it is easy to perceive that you have been a great 
 deal in society there is something so pure runs through 
 what you say 
 
 that is quite true said the and he made a spring 
 with joy and splashed some water on the floor 
 
 then the saucepan went on with his story and the end was as good 
 as the beginning 
 
 the plates rattled with pleasure and the brought 
 some green parsley out of the and crowned the saucepan 
 for he knew it would vex the others and he thought if i crown him 
 he will crown me 
 
 now let us have a dance said the and then how 
 they danced and stuck up one leg in the air the in 
 the corner burst with laughter when she saw it 
 
 shall i be crowned now asked the so the broom 
 found another wreath for the tongs 
 
 they were only common people after all thought the matches 
 the was now asked to sing but she said she had a cold and 
 could not sing without boiling heat they all thought this was 
 affectation and because she did not wish to sing excepting in the 
 parlor when on the table with the grand people 
 
 in the window sat an old with which the maid generally 
 wrote there was nothing remarkable about the pen excepting that it 
 had been dipped too deeply in the ink but it was proud of that 
 
 if the sing said the pen she can leave it alone there is a nightingale in a cage who can sing she has not been taught much certainly but we need not say anything this evening about that 
 
 i think it highly improper said the who was kitchen singer and to the that a rich foreign bird should be listened to here is it patriotic let the decide what is right 
 
 i certainly am vexed said the basket inwardly vexed more 
 than any one can imagine are we spending the evening properly 
 would it not be more sensible to put the house in order if each 
 were in his own place i would lead a game this would be quite another thing 
 
 let us act a play said they all at the same moment the door 
 opened and the maid came in then not one stirred they all 
 remained quite still yet at the same time there was not a single 
 pot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself and of what he could do if he chose 
 
 yes if we had chosen they each thought we might have 
 spent a very pleasant evening 
 
 the maid took the matches and lighted them dear me how they 
 sputtered and blazed up 
 
 now then they thought every one will see that we are the 
 first how we shine what a light we give even while they spoke 
 their light went out 
 
 what a capital story said the queen i feel as if i were 
 really in the kitchen and could see the matches yes you shall marry 
 our daughter 
 
 certainly said the king thou shalt have our daughter the 
 king said thou to him because he was going to be one of the family 
 the was fixed and on the evening before the whole 
 city was illuminated cakes and sweetmeats were thrown among the 
 people the street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted hurrah and 
 whistled between their fingers altogether it was a very splendid 
 affair 
 
 i will give them another treat said the son so he 
 went and bought rockets and crackers and all sorts of that 
 could be thought of packed them in his trunk and flew up with it 
 into the air what a whizzing and popping they made as they went 
 off the turks when they saw such a sight in the air jumped so 
 high that their slippers flew about their ears it was easy to believe 
 after this that the princess was really going to marry a turkish 
 angel 
 
 as soon as the son had come down in his flying trunk to 
 the wood after the fireworks he thought i will go back into the 
 town now and hear what they think of the entertainment it was 
 very natural that he should wish to know and what strange things 
 people did say to be sure every one whom he questioned had a 
 different tale to tell though they all thought it very beautiful 
 
 i saw the turkish angel myself said one he had eyes like 
 glittering stars and a head like foaming water 
 
 he flew in a mantle of fire cried another and lovely little 
 cherubs peeped out from the folds 
 
 he heard many more fine things about himself and that the next 
 day he was to be married after this he went back to the forest to 
 rest himself in his trunk it had disappeared a spark from the 
 fireworks which remained had set it on fire it was burnt to ashes so 
 the son could not fly any more nor go to meet his bride 
 she stood all day on the roof waiting for him and most likely she 
 is waiting there still while he wanders through the world telling 
 fairy tales but none of them so amusing as the one he related about 
 the matches

 of honour reputation 
 the winning of honour is but the revealing of a virtue and worth without 
 disadvantage for some in their actions do woo and affect honour and reputation 
 which sort of men are commonly much talked of but inwardly little admired and some contrariwise darken their virtue in the show of it so as they be undervalued in opinion if a man perform that which hath not been attempted before or attempted and given over or ham been achieved but not with so good circumstance he shall purchase more honour than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue wherein he is but a follower if a man so temper his actions as in some one of them he doth content every faction or combination of people the music will be the fuller 
 
 a man is an ill husband of his honour that entereth into any action the failing 
 wherein may disgrace him more than the carrying of it through can honour him honour that is gained and broken upon another hath the quickest reflection like diamonds cut with facets 
 and therefore let a man contend to excel any competitors of his in honour in them if he can in their own bow discreet followers and servants help much to reputation onuus farm a danestids emanat envy which is me 
 canker of honour is best extinguished by declaring a self in his ends rather 
 to seek merit man fame and by attributing a successes rather to divine 
 providence and felicity than to his own virtue or policy the true marshalling of 
 the degrees of sovereign honour are these in the first place are concstorvsynperionan founders of states and commonwealths such as were romulus cyrus caesar ottoman ismael in the second place are kgidttones lawgivers which are also called second founders or papead prindpes because they govern by their ordinances after they are gone such were lycurgus 
 solon justinian eadgar alphonsus of castile the wise that made the siete parados 
 
 in the third place are or sahcams such as compound the long miseries of civil wars or deliver their countries from servitude of strangers or tyrants as 
 augustus caesar vespasianus aurelianus theodoricus henry vh of england and henry iv of france in me fourth place are or prnpugnatores imperil such as in honourable wars enlarge their territories or make noble defence against invaders 
 and in the last place are patres patriae which reign justly and make the times good wherein they live both which last kinds need no examples they are in such number 
 degrees of honour in subjects are first paihapes cwarwn those upon whom princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs their right hands as we call them 
 the next are duces bes great leaders such as are princes lieutenants and do them notable services in the wars the third are arias favourites such as exceed not this scantling to be solace to the sovereign and harmless to the people and the fourth negotas pares such as have great places under princes and execute their places with sufficiency 
 
 there is an honour likewise which may be ranked amongst the greatest which happeneth rarely that is of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of their country as was m regulus and the two decii

 chapter ii 
 
 how jean may become champ 
 one morning m madeleine was in his study occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the office in case he should decide to take the trip to montfermeil when he was informed that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him 
 madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name 
 javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the and m madeleine had not seen him 
 admit him he said 
 javert entered 
 m madeleine had retained his seat near the fire pen in hand his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations 
 he did not disturb himself on account 
 he could not help thinking of poor fantine and it suited him to be glacial in his manner 
 javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor whose back was turned to him 
 the mayor did not look at him but went on annotating this docket 
 javert advanced two or three paces into the study and halted without breaking the silence 
 if any physiognomist who had been familiar with javert and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the corporal this spy who was incapable of a lie this unspotted police any physiognomist had known his secret and aversion for m madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject of fantine and had examined javert at that moment he would have said to himself what has taken place it was evident to any one acquainted with that clear upright sincere honest austere and ferocious conscience that javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle 
 javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance 
 like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling on entering he bowed to m madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor anger nor distrust he halted a few paces in the rear of the and there he stood perfectly erect in an attitude almost of discipline with the cold ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient he waited without uttering a word without making a movement in genuine humility and tranquil resignation calm serious hat in hand with eyes cast down and an expression which was between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge until it should please the mayor to turn round 
 all the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared 
 that face as impenetrable and simple as granite no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression 
 his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency 
 at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round 
 well 
 what is it 
 what is the matter javert 
 javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not however preclude simplicity 
 this is the matter mr mayor a culpable act has been committed 
 what act 
 an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the gravest manner towards a magistrate 
 i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge as it is my duty to do 
 who is the agent asked m madeleine 
 i said javert 
 you 
 i 
 and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent 
 you mr mayor 
 m madeleine sat erect in his javert went on with a severe air and his eyes still cast down 
 mr mayor i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me 
 m madeleine opened his mouth in amazement 
 javert interrupted him 
 you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does not suffice 
 handing in resignation is honorable i have failed in my duty i ought to be punished i must be turned out 
 and after a pause he added 
 mr mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly be so with justice 
 come now 
 why exclaimed m madeleine 
 what nonsense is this what is the meaning of this 
 what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me 
 what have you done to me 
 what are your wrongs with regard to me 
 you accuse yourself you wish to be superseded 
 turned out said javert 
 turned out so it be then 
 that is well 
 i do not understand 
 you shall understand mr mayor 
 javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resumed still coldly and sadly 
 mr mayor six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman i was furious and i informed against you 
 informed against me 
 at the prefecture of police in paris 
 m madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than javert himself burst out laughing now 
 as a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police 
 as an 
 the mayor turned livid 
 javert who had not raised his eyes went on 
 i thought it was so 
 i had had an idea for a long time a resemblance inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles the strength of your loins the adventure with old fauchelevant your skill in marksmanship your leg which you drag a little i hardly know what 
 but at all events i took you for a certain jean valjean 
 a did you say the name was 
 jean valjean 
 he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago when i was of convicts at toulon on leaving the galleys this jean valjean as it appears robbed a bishop then he committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public highway on the person of a little savoyard 
 he disappeared eight years ago no one knows how and he has been sought i fancied in short i did this thing 
 wrath impelled me i denounced you at the prefecture 
 m madeleine who had taken up the docket again several moments before this resumed with an air of perfect indifference 
 and what reply did you receive 
 that i was mad 
 well 
 well they were right 
 it is lucky that you recognize the fact 
 i am forced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found 
 the sheet of paper which m madeleine was holding dropped from his hand he raised his head gazed fixedly at javert and said with his indescribable accent 
 ah 
 javert continued 
 this is the way it is mr mayor 
 it seems that there was in the neighborhood near an old fellow who was called father champmathieu 
 he was a very wretched creature no one paid any attention to him 
 no one knows what such people subsist on 
 lately last autumn father champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples no matter a theft had been committed a wall scaled branches of trees broken my champmathieu was arrested 
 he still had the branch of in his hand 
 the scamp is locked up 
 up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor 
 but here is where providence intervened 
 the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer champmathieu to arras where the departmental prison is situated 
 in this prison at arras there is an named brevet who is detained for i know not what and who has been appointed turnkey of the house because of good behavior mr mayor no sooner had champmathieu arrived than brevet exclaims eh why i know that man 
 he is a fagot take a good look at me my good man 
 you are jean valjean 
 jean valjean jean valjean champmathieu feigns astonishment 
 play the innocent dodge says brevet 
 you are jean valjean 
 you have been in the galleys of toulon it was twenty years ago we were there together champmathieu denies it 
 parbleu 
 you understand 
 the case is investigated 
 the thing was well ventilated for me 
 this is what they discovered 
 this champmathieu had been thirty years ago a pruner of trees in various localities notably at faverolles there all trace of him was lost 
 a long time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne then in paris where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that has not been proved 
 now before going to the galleys for theft what was jean valjean 
 a pruner of trees 
 where 
 at faverolles another fact 
 this christian name was jean and his surname was mathieu 
 what more natural to suppose than that on emerging from the galleys he should have taken his name for the purpose of concealing himself and have called himself jean mathieu 
 he goes to auvergne 
 the local pronunciation turns jean into is called chan mathieu 
 our man offers no opposition and behold him transformed into champmathieu 
 you follow me do you not 
 inquiries were made at faverolles 
 the family of jean valjean is no longer there 
 it is not known where they have gone you know that among those classes a family often disappears search was made and nothing was found 
 when such people are not mud they are dust 
 and then as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back there is no longer any one at faverolles who knew jean valjean 
 inquiries were made at toulon 
 besides brevet there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean they are cochepaille and chenildieu and are sentenced for life they are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended champmathieu 
 they do not hesitate he is jean valjean for them as well as for brevet 
 the same is the same height the same air the same man in short it is he it was precisely at this moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris 
 i was told that i had lost my reason and that jean valjean is at arras in the power of the authorities you can imagine whether this surprised me when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here 
 i write to the examining judge he sends for me champmathieu is conducted to me 
 an 
 well interposed m madeleine 
 javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy as ever 
 mr mayor the truth is the truth 
 i am sorry but that man is jean valjean 
 i recognized him also 
 m madeleine resumed in a very low voice 
 you are sure 
 javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction 
 o 
 sure 
 he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table and he added 
 and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean i do not see how i could have thought otherwise 
 i beg your pardon mr mayor 
 javert as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole and bade him leave the that haughty man was unconsciously full of simplicity and madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question 
 and what does this man say 
 ah 
 indeed mr mayor a bad business 
 if he is jean valjean he has his previous conviction against him 
 to climb a wall to break a branch to purloin apples is a mischievous trick in a child for a man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime robbing and is all there 
 it is no longer a question of correctional police it is a matter for the court of assizes it is no longer a matter of a few days in prison it is the galleys for life 
 and then there is the affair with the little savoyard who will return i hope 
 the deuce there is plenty to dispute in the matter is there not 
 yes for any one but jean valjean but jean valjean is a sly dog 
 that is the way i recognized him any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry kettle sings before the fire he would not be jean valjean et cetera 
 but he has not the appearance of understanding he says i am champmathieu and i depart from that 
 he has an astonished air he pretends to be stupid it is far better 
 oh the rogue is clever 
 but it makes no difference the proofs are there 
 he has been recognized by four persons the old scamp will be condemned 
 the case has been taken to the assizes at arras 
 i shall go there to give my testimony 
 i have been summoned 
 m madeleine had turned to his desk again and taken up his docket and was turning over the leaves tranquilly reading and writing by turns like a busy man 
 he turned to javert 
 that will do javert 
 in truth all these details interest me but little 
 we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand 
 javert you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman buseaupied who sells herbs at the corner of the rue you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre chesnelong 
 the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and her child 
 he must be punished 
 you will then go to m charcellay rue he complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges on his premises and is undermining the foundations of his house after that you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the rue guibourg at widow and rue du at madame renee le and you will prepare documents 
 but i am giving you a great deal of work are you not to be absent 
 did you not tell me that you were going to arras on that matter in a week or ten days 
 sooner than that mr mayor 
 on what day then 
 why i thought that i had said to monsieur le maire that the case was to be tried and that i am to set out by diligence 
 m madeleine made an imperceptible movement 
 and how long will the case last 
 one day at the most 
 the judgment will be pronounced evening at latest 
 but i shall not wait for the sentence which is certain i shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken 
 that is well said m madeleine 
 and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand 
 javert did not withdraw 
 excuse me mr mayor said he 
 what is it now demanded m madeleine 
 mr mayor there is still something of which i must remind you 
 what is it 
 that i must be dismissed 
 m madeleine rose 
 javert you are a man of honor and i esteem you 
 you exaggerate your fault 
 moreover this is an offence which concerns me javert you deserve promotion instead of degradation 
 i wish you to retain your post 
 javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible and said in a tranquil voice 
 mr mayor i cannot grant you that 
 i repeat replied m madeleine that the matter concerns me 
 but javert heeding his own thought only continued 
 so far as exaggeration is concerned i am not exaggerating 
 this is the way i reason 
 i have suspected you unjustly 
 that is nothing it is our right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse 
 but without proofs in a fit of rage with the object of wreaking my vengeance i have denounced you as a convict you a respectable man a mayor a magistrate that is serious very serious 
 i have insulted authority in your person i an agent of the authorities 
 if one of my subordinates had done what i have done i should have declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him 
 well 
 stop mr mayor one word more i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others that is just 
 i have done well 
 now if i were not severe towards myself all the justice that i have done would become injustice ought i to spare myself more than others 
 no 
 what 
 i should be good for nothing but to chastise others and not myself 
 why i should be a blackguard 
 those who say that blackguard of a javert would be in the right 
 mr mayor i do not desire that you should treat me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others 
 i want none of it for myself the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is up in the world is what i call false kindness that is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society 
 good god it is very easy to be kind the difficulty lies in being just come if you had been what i thought you i should not have been kind to you not i 
 you would have seen 
 mr mayor i must treat myself as i would treat any other man 
 when i have subdued malefactors when i have proceeded with vigor against rascals i have often said to myself if you flinch if i ever catch you in fault you may rest at your ease 
 i have flinched i have caught myself in a fault so much the worse 
 come discharged cashiered expelled 
 that is well i have arms 
 i will till the soil it makes no difference to me mr mayor the good of the service demands an example 
 i simply require the discharge of inspector javert 
 all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced tone which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man 
 we shall see said m madeleine 
 and he offered him his hand 
 javert recoiled and said in a wild voice 
 excuse me mr mayor but this must not be 
 a mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy 
 he added between his teeth 
 a police spy yes from the moment when i have misused the police i am no more than a police spy 
 then he bowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door 
 there he wheeled round and with eyes still downcast 
 mr mayor he said i shall continue to serve until i am superseded 
 he withdrew 
 m madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm sure step which died away on the pavement of the corridor

 book three 
 chapter vi 
 
 it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the letter 
 anna mikhaylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same time 
 anna mikhaylovna though her circumstances had improved was still living with the rostovs 
 my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to sympathize in any way 
 the count sobbed yet more 
 nikolenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how tell the little countess 
 anna mikhaylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with help would inform her 
 at dinner anna mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about nikolenka twice asked when the last letter had been received from him though she knew that already and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters natasha who of the whole family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and anna mikhaylovna that it had something to do with her brother and that anna mikhaylovna was preparing them for it bold as she was natasha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed head long after anna mikhaylovna and dashing at her flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room 
 auntie darling do tell me what it is 
 nothing my dear 
 no dearest sweet one honey i give up i know you know something 
 anna mikhaylovna shook her head 
 you are a little slyboots she said 
 a letter from nikolenka sure of it exclaimed natasha reading confirmation in anna face 
 but for sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma 
 i will i will only tell me you then i will go and tell at once 
 anna mikhaylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter on condition that she should tell no one 
 no on my true word of honor said herself i tell anyone and she ran off at once to sonya 
 nikolenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful triumph 
 nicholas was all sonya said instantly turning white 
 natasha seeing the impression the of her wound produced on sonya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news 
 she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry 
 a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he wrote himself said she through her tears 
 there now true that all you women are crybabies remarked petya pacing the room with large resolute strides now very glad very glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so you are all blubberers and understand nothing 
 natasha smiled through her tears 
 you read the letter asked sonya 
 no but she said that it was all over and that now an officer 
 thank god said sonya crossing herself but perhaps she deceived you let us go to mamma 
 petya paced the room in silence for a time 
 if been in place i would have killed even more of those frenchmen he said what nasty brutes they are have killed so many that have been a heap of them 
 hold your tongue petya what a goose you are 
 not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said petya 
 do you remember him natasha suddenly asked after a silence 
 sonya smiled 
 do i remember nicholas 
 no sonya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly remember everything said natasha with an expressive gesture evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning i remember nikolenka too i remember him well she said but i remember boris i remember him a bit 
 what you remember boris asked sonya in surprise 
 not that i remember i know what he is like but not as i remember nikolenka him i just shut my eyes and remember but boris no she shut her nothing at all 
 oh natasha said sonya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was out of the question i am in love with your brother once for all and whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as long as i live 
 natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said nothing she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of but natasha had not yet felt anything like it she believed it could be but did not understand it 
 shall you write to him she asked 
 sonya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself 
 i know i think if he writes i will write too she said blushing 
 and you feel ashamed to write to him 
 sonya smiled 
 no 
 and i should be ashamed to write to boris not going to 
 why should you be ashamed 
 well i know awkward and would make me ashamed 
 and i know why be ashamed said petya offended by previous remark because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles that was how petya described his namesake the new count bezukhov and now in love with that singer he meant italian singing master why ashamed 
 petya a stupid said natasha 
 not more stupid than you madam said the petya with the air of an old brigadier 
 the countess had been prepared by anna hints at dinner on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter came on tiptoe to the countess door and paused 
 come in she said to the old count who was following her come later and she went in closing the door behind her 
 the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened 
 at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps anna mikhaylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill 
 it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips 
 when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away the bald head vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the room and the reading of the letter began after a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his promotion nicholas said that he kissed his and hands asking for their blessing and that he kissed vera natasha and petya besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schoss and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear sonya whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was crying 
 why are you crying mamma asked vera from all he says one should be glad and not cry 
 this was quite true but the count the countess and natasha looked at her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought the countess 
 nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she did not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses and dmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of virtues how strange how extraordinary how joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had first learned to say pear and then granny that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warrior doing some kind of work of his own without help or guidance the universal experience of ages showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the countess her growth toward manhood at each of its stages had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty years before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this letter he now was 
 what a style how charmingly he describes said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word about himself not a word about some denisov or other though he himself i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about his sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has remembered everybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only so high i always said 
 for more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikhaylovna practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostovs supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards there was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regiment which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the grand courier to boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the letters were from the old count the countess petya vera natasha and sonya and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the garden of paradise 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a son who had a larger and more beautiful 
 collection of books than any one else in the world and full of 
 splendid engravings he could read and obtain information respecting every people of every land but not a word could he find to explain the situation of the garden of paradise and this was just what he most wished to know his grandmother had told him when he was quite a little boy just old enough to go to school that each flower in the garden of paradise was a sweet cake that the pistils were full of rich wine that on one flower history was written on another geography or tables so those who wished to learn their 
 lessons had only to eat some of the cakes and the more they ate 
 the more history geography or tables they knew he believed it all 
 then but as he grew older and learnt more and more he became wise 
 enough to understand that the splendor of the garden of paradise 
 must be very different to all this oh why did eve pluck the fruit 
 from the tree of knowledge why did adam eat the forbidden fruit 
 thought the son if i had been there it would never have 
 happened and there would have been no sin in the world the garden of paradise occupied all his thoughts till he reached his 
 seventeenth year one day he was walking alone in the wood which was his greatest pleasure when evening came on the clouds gathered and the rain poured down as if the sky had been a waterspout and it was as dark as the bottom of a well at midnight sometimes he slipped over the smooth grass or fell over stones that projected out of the rocky ground 
 
 every thing was dripping with moisture and the poor prince had not 
 a dry thread about him he was obliged at last to climb over great 
 blocks of stone with water spurting from the thick moss he began 
 to feel quite faint when he heard a most singular rushing noise 
 and saw before him a large cave from which came a blaze of light 
 in the middle of the cave an immense fire was burning and a noble 
 stag with its branching horns was placed on a spit between the 
 trunks of two it was turning slowly before the fire and 
 an elderly woman as large and strong as if she had been a man in 
 disguise sat by throwing one piece of wood after another into the 
 flames 
 
 come in she said to the prince sit down by the fire and dry 
 yourself 
 
 there is a great draught here said the prince as he seated 
 himself on the ground 
 
 it will be worse when my sons come home replied the woman 
 you are now in the cavern of the winds and my sons are the four winds of heaven can you understand that 
 
 where are your sons asked the prince 
 
 it is difficult to answer stupid questions said the woman 
 
 my sons have plenty of business on hand they are playing at 
 shuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the hall and she 
 pointed upwards 
 
 oh indeed said the prince but you speak more roughly and 
 harshly and are not so gentle as the women i am used to 
 
 yes that is because they have nothing else to do but i am 
 obliged to be harsh to keep my boys in order and i can do it 
 although they are so do you see those four sacks 
 hanging on the wall well they are just as much afraid of those 
 sacks as you used to be of the rat behind the i can 
 bend the boys together and put them in the sacks without any 
 resistance on their parts i can tell you there they stay and dare 
 not attempt to come out until i allow them to do so and here comes 
 one of them 
 
 it was the north wind who came in bringing with him a cold 
 piercing blast large hailstones rattled on the floor and 
 snowflakes were scattered around in all directions he wore a bearskin dress and cloak his sealskin cap was drawn over his ears long icicles hung from his beard and one hailstone after another rolled from the collar of his jacket 
 
 go too near the fire said the prince or your hands 
 and face will be 
 
 said the north wind with a loud laugh why frost 
 is my greatest delight what sort of a little snip are you and how 
 did you find your way to the cavern of the winds 
 
 he is my guest said the old woman and if you are not 
 satisfied with that explanation you can go into the sack do you 
 understand me 
 
 that settled the matter so the north wind began to relate his 
 adventures whence he came and where he had been for a whole month 
 
 i come from the polar seas he said i have been on the 
 island with the russian i sat and slept at the helm of 
 their ship as they sailed away from north cape sometimes when i 
 woke the would fly about my legs they are curious birds they give one flap with their wings and then on their outstretched pinions soar far away 
 
 make such a long story of it said the mother of the 
 winds what sort of a place is island 
 
 a very beautiful place with a floor for dancing as smooth and 
 flat as a plate snow partly covered with moss sharp 
 stones and skeletons of walruses and lie all about 
 their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay it would seem as if 
 the sun never shone there i blew gently to clear away the mist 
 and then i saw a little hut which had been built from the wood of a 
 wreck and was covered with the skins of the walrus the fleshy side 
 outwards it looked green and red and on the roof sat a growling 
 bear then i went to the sea shore to look after birds nests and 
 saw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths and screaming for 
 food i blew into the thousand little throats and quickly stopped 
 their screaming farther on were the walruses with heads and 
 teeth a yard long rolling about like great worms 
 
 you relate your adventures very well my son said the mother 
 
 it makes my mouth water to hear you 
 
 after that continued the north wind the hunting commenced 
 
 the harpoon was flung into the breast of the walrus so that a smoking stream of blood spurted forth like a fountain and besprinkled the ice then i thought of my own game i began to blow and set my own ships the great icebergs sailing so that they might crush the boats 
 
 oh how the sailors howled and cried out but i howled louder than 
 they they were obliged to unload their cargo and throw their 
 chests and the dead walruses on the ice then i sprinkled snow over 
 them and left them in their crushed boats to drift southward and 
 to taste salt water they will never return to island 
 
 so you have done mischief said the mother of the winds 
 
 i shall leave others to tell the good i have done he replied 
 
 but here comes my brother from the west i like him best of all 
 for he has the smell of the sea about him and brings in a cold fresh 
 air as he enters 
 
 is that the little zephyr asked the prince 
 
 yes it is the little zephyr said the old woman but he is not 
 little now in years gone by he was a beautiful boy now that is all 
 past 
 
 he came in looking like a wild man and he wore a slouched hat to 
 protect his head from injury in his hand he carried a club cut 
 from a mahogany tree in the american forests not a trifle to carry 
 
 whence do you come asked the mother 
 
 i come from the wilds of the forests where the thorny brambles 
 form thick hedges between the trees where the lies in the 
 wet grass and mankind seem to be unknown 
 
 what were you doing there 
 
 i looked into the deep river and saw it rushing down from the 
 rocks the water drops mounted to the clouds and glittered in the 
 rainbow i saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river but the 
 strong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks which 
 flew into the air as the waters dashed onwards leaving the buffalo to 
 be hurled over the waterfall this pleased me so i raised a storm 
 which rooted up old trees and sent them floating down the river 
 and what else have you done asked the old woman 
 
 i have rushed wildly across the savannahs i have stroked the 
 wild horses and shaken the from the trees yes i have 
 many stories to relate but i need not tell everything i know you 
 know it all very well you old lady and he kissed his 
 mother so roughly that she nearly fell backwards oh he was indeed a wild fellow 
 
 now in came the south wind with a turban and a flowing bedouin 
 cloak 
 
 how cold it is here said he throwing more wood on the fire 
 
 it is easy to feel that the north wind has arrived here before me 
 
 why it is hot enough here to roast a bear said the north wind 
 
 you are a bear yourself said the other 
 
 do you want to be put in the sack both of you said the old 
 woman sit down now on that stone yonder and tell me where you have been 
 
 in africa mother i went out with the hottentots who were 
 in the kaffir land where the plains are covered with 
 grass the color of a green olive and here i ran races with the 
 ostrich but i soon outstripped him in swiftness at last i came to 
 the desert in which lie the golden sands looking like the bottom 
 of the sea here i met a caravan and the travellers had just killed 
 their last camel to obtain water there was very little for them and 
 they continued their painful journey beneath the burning sun and over 
 the hot sands which stretched before them a vast boundless desert 
 then i rolled myself in the loose sand and whirled it in burning 
 columns over their heads the dromedarys stood still in terror 
 while the merchants drew their caftans over their heads and threw 
 themselves on the ground before me as they do before allah their 
 god then i buried them beneath a pyramid of sand which covers them all when i blow that away on my next visit the sun will bleach their bones and travellers will see that others have been there before 
 them otherwise in such a wild desert they might not believe it 
 possible 
 
 so you have done nothing but evil said the mother into the 
 sack with you and before he was aware she had seized the south 
 wind round the body and popped him into the bag he rolled about on the floor till she sat herself upon him to keep him still 
 
 these boys of yours are very lively said the prince 
 
 yes she replied but i know how to correct them when 
 necessary and here comes the fourth in came the east wind 
 dressed like a chinese 
 
 oh you come from that quarter do you said she i thought you 
 had been to the garden of paradise 
 
 i am going there he replied i have not been there 
 for a hundred years i have just come from china where i danced round the porcelain tower till all the bells jingled again in the streets 
 an official flogging was taking place and bamboo canes were being 
 broken on the shoulders of men of every high position from the 
 first to the ninth grade they cried many thanks my fatherly 
 benefactor but i am sure the words did not come from their hearts 
 so i rang the bells till they sounded ding 
 
 you are a wild boy said the old woman it is well for you that 
 you are going to the garden of paradise you always get 
 improved in your education there drink deeply from the fountain of 
 wisdom while you are there and bring home a bottleful for me 
 
 that i will said the east wind but why have you put my 
 brother south in a bag let him out for i want him to tell me about 
 the the princess always wants to hear of this bird 
 when i pay her my visit every hundred years if you will open the 
 sack sweetest mother i will give you two pocketfuls of tea green 
 and fresh as when i gathered it from the spot where it grew 
 
 well for the sake of the tea and because you are my own boy 
 i will open the bag 
 
 she did so and the south wind crept out looking quite cast down 
 because the prince had seen his disgrace 
 
 there is a for the princess he said the old 
 phoenix the only one in the world gave it to me himself he has 
 scratched on it with his beak the whole of his history during the 
 hundred years he has lived she can there read how the old phoenix set fire to his own nest and sat upon it while it was burning like a 
 hindoo widow the dry twigs around the nest crackled and smoked till the flames burst forth and consumed the phoenix to ashes amidst the fire lay an egg red hot which presently burst with a loud report 
 and out flew a young bird he is the only phoenix in the world and 
 the king over all the other birds he has bitten a hole in the leaf 
 which i give you and that is his greeting to the princess 
 
 now let us have something to eat said the mother of the 
 winds so they all sat down to feast on the roasted stag and as the 
 prince sat by the side of the east wind they soon became good 
 friends 
 
 pray tell me said the prince who is that princess of whom you 
 have been talking and where lies the garden of paradise 
 
 ho ho said the east wind would you like to go there well 
 you can fly off with me but i must tell you one thing no 
 human being has been there since the time of adam and eve i suppose you have read of them in your bible 
 
 of course i have said the prince 
 
 well continued the east wind when they were driven out of the 
 garden of paradise it sunk into the earth but it retained its warm 
 sunshine its balmy air and all its splendor the fairy queen lives 
 there in the island of happiness where death never comes and all is 
 beautiful i can manage to take you there if you will sit 
 on my back but now talk any more for i want to go to sleep 
 and then they all slept 
 
 when the prince awoke in the early morning he was not a little 
 surprised at finding himself high up above the clouds he was seated 
 on the back of the east wind who held him faithfully and they were 
 so high in the air that woods and fields rivers and lakes as they 
 lay beneath them looked like a painted map 
 
 good morning said the east wind you might have slept on a 
 while for there is very little to see in the flat country over 
 
 which we are passing unless you like to count the churches they 
 look like spots of chalk on a green board the green board was the 
 name he gave to the green fields and meadows 
 
 it was very rude of me not to say to your mother and 
 your brothers said the prince 
 
 they will excuse you as you were asleep said the east wind 
 and then they flew on faster than ever 
 
 the leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they passed 
 when they flew over seas and lakes the waves rose higher and the 
 large ships dipped into the water like diving swans as darkness 
 came on towards evening the great towns looked charming lights were sparkling now seen now hidden just as the sparks go out one after another on a piece of burnt paper the prince clapped his hands with pleasure but the east wind advised him not to express his 
 admiration in that manner or he might fall down and find himself 
 hanging on a church steeple the eagle in the dark forests flies 
 swiftly but faster than he flew the east wind the cossack on his 
 small horse rides lightly the plains but lighter still passed 
 the prince on the winds of the wind 
 
 there are the himalayas the highest mountains in asia said the 
 east wind we shall soon reach the garden of paradise now 
 then they turned southward and the air became fragrant with 
 the perfume of spices and flowers here figs and pomegranates grew 
 wild and the vines were covered with clusters of blue and purple 
 grapes here they both descended to the earth and stretched 
 themselves on the soft grass while the flowers bowed to the breath of 
 the wind as if to welcome it are we now in the garden of 
 paradise asked the prince 
 
 no indeed replied the east wind but we shall be there very 
 soon do you see that wall of rocks and the cavern beneath it over 
 which the grape vines hang like a green curtain through that cavern 
 we must pass wrap your cloak round you for while the sun scorches you here a few steps farther it will be icy cold the bird flying past the entrance to the cavern feels as if one wing were in the 
 region of summer and the other in the depths of winter 
 
 so this then is the way to the garden of paradise asked the 
 prince as they entered the cavern it was indeed cold but the cold 
 soon passed for the east wind spread his wings and they gleamed like the brightest fire as they passed on through this wonderful cave the prince could see great blocks of stone from which water trickled 
 hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes sometimes it was so 
 narrow that they had to creep on their hands and knees while at other 
 times it was lofty and wide like the free air it had the 
 appearance of a chapel for the dead with petrified organs and 
 silent pipes we seem to be passing through the valley of death to 
 the garden of paradise said the prince 
 
 but the east wind answered not a word only pointed forwards to 
 a lovely blue light which gleamed in the distance the blocks of stone 
 assumed a misty appearance till at last they looked like white clouds 
 in moonlight the air was fresh and balmy like a breeze from the 
 mountains perfumed with flowers from a valley of roses a river clear as the air itself sparkled at their feet while in its clear depths 
 could be seen gold and silver fish sporting in the bright water and 
 purple eels emitting sparks of fire at every moment while the broad 
 leaves of the that floated on its surface flickered 
 with all the colors of the rainbow the flower in its color of flame 
 seemed to receive its nourishment from the water as a lamp is 
 sustained by oil a marble bridge of such exquisite workmanship 
 that it appeared as if formed of lace and pearls led to the island of 
 happiness in which bloomed the garden of paradise the east wind took the prince in his arms and carried him over while the flowers and the leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in tones so full 
 and soft that no human voice could venture to imitate within the 
 garden grew large trees full of sap but whether they were 
 or gigantic the prince knew not the climbing plants 
 hung in garlands of green and gold like the illuminations on the 
 margins of old missals or twined among the initial letters birds 
 flowers and festoons appeared intermingled in seeming confusion 
 close by on the grass stood a group of peacocks with radiant 
 tails outspread to the sun the prince touched them and found to his 
 surprise that they were not really birds but the leaves of the 
 burdock tree which shone with the colors of a tail the 
 lion and the tiger gentle and tame were springing about like playful 
 cats among the green bushes whose perfume was like the fragrant 
 blossom of the olive the plumage of the glistened like 
 pearls as it struck the mane with its wings while the 
 antelope usually so shy stood near nodding its head as if it wished 
 to join in the frolic the fairy of paradise next made her appearance 
 her raiment shone like the sun and her serene countenance beamed with happiness like that of a mother rejoicing over her child she was 
 young and beautiful and a train of lovely maidens followed her 
 each wearing a bright star in her hair the east wind gave her the 
 on which was written the history of the phoenix and her 
 eyes sparkled with joy she then took the prince by the hand and 
 led him into her palace the walls of which were richly colored 
 like a when it is turned to the sun the roof had the 
 appearance of an inverted flower and the colors grew deeper and 
 brighter to the gazer the prince walked to a window and saw what 
 appeared to be the tree of knowledge of good and evil with adam and eve standing by and the serpent near them i thought they were 
 banished from paradise he said 
 
 the princess smiled and told him that time had engraved each 
 event on a in the form of a picture but unlike other 
 pictures all that it represented lived and moved the leaves 
 rustled and the persons went and came as in a he 
 looked through another pane and saw the ladder in dream on which the angels were ascending and descending with outspread wings 
 
 all that had ever happened in the world here lived and moved on the 
 panes of glass in pictures such as time alone could produce the 
 fairy now led the prince into a large lofty room with transparent 
 walls through which the light shone here were portraits each one 
 appearing more beautiful than the other millions of happy beings 
 whose laughter and song mingled in one sweet melody some of these 
 were in such an elevated position that they appeared smaller than 
 the smallest rosebud or like pencil dots on paper in the centre of 
 the hall stood a tree with drooping branches from which hung 
 golden apples both great and small looking like oranges amid the 
 green leaves it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil from 
 which adam and eve had plucked and eaten the forbidden fruit and from each leaf trickled a bright red dewdrop as if the tree were weeping tears of blood for their sin let us now take the boat said the fairy a sail on the cool waters will refresh us but we shall not 
 move from the spot although the boat may rock on the swelling 
 water the countries of the world will glide before us but we shall 
 remain still 
 
 it was indeed wonderful to behold first came the lofty alps 
 and covered with clouds and dark pines the horn resounded and the shepherds sang merrily in the valleys the bent their drooping branches over the boat black swans floated on the water and singular animals and flowers appeared on the distant shore new holland the fifth division of the world now glided by with mountains in the background looking blue in the distance they 
 heard the song of the priests and saw the wild dance of the savage to 
 the sound of the drums and trumpets of bone the pyramids of egypt 
 rising to the clouds columns and sphinxes overthrown and buried in 
 the sand followed in their turn while the northern lights flashed 
 out over the extinguished volcanoes of the north in fireworks none 
 could imitate 
 
 the prince was delighted and yet he saw hundreds of other 
 wonderful things more than can be described can i stay here 
 forever asked he 
 
 that depends upon yourself replied the fairy if you do not 
 like adam long for what is forbidden you can remain here always 
 
 i should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge said 
 the prince there is abundance of fruit equally beautiful 
 
 examine your own heart said the princess and if you do not 
 feel sure of its strength return with the east wind who brought 
 you he is about to fly back and will not return here for a hundred 
 years the time will not seem to you more than a hundred hours yet 
 even that is a long time for temptation and resistance every evening 
 when i leave you i shall be obliged to say come with me and to 
 beckon to you with my hand but you must not listen nor move from 
 your place to follow me for with every step you will find your 
 power to resist weaker if once you attempted to follow me you 
 would soon find yourself in the hall where grows the tree of 
 knowledge for i sleep beneath its perfumed branches if you stooped 
 over me i should be forced to smile if you then kissed my lips 
 the garden of paradise would sink into the earth and to you it 
 would be lost a keen wind from the desert would howl around you cold rain fall on your head and sorrow and woe be your future lot 
 i will remain said the prince 
 
 so the east wind kissed him on the forehead and said be firm 
 then shall we meet again when a hundred years have passed farewell 
 farewell then the east wind spread his broad pinions which shone 
 like the lightning in harvest or as the northern lights in a cold 
 winter 
 
 farewell farewell echoed the trees and the flowers 
 storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands to accompany 
 him to the boundaries of the garden 
 
 now we will commence dancing said the fairy and when it is 
 nearly over at sunset while i am dancing with you i shall make a 
 sign and ask you to follow me but do not obey i shall be obliged to 
 repeat the same thing for a hundred years and each time when the 
 trial is past if you resist you will gain strength till resistance becomes easy and at last the temptation will be quite overcome this evening as it will be the first time i have warned you 
 
 after this the fairy led him into a large hall filled with 
 transparent lilies the yellow stamina of each flower formed a tiny 
 golden harp from which came forth strains of music like the mingled 
 tones of flute and lyre beautiful maidens slender and graceful in 
 form and robed in transparent gauze floated through the dance and 
 sang of the happy life in the garden of paradise where death never 
 entered and where all would bloom forever in immortal youth as the 
 sun went down the whole heavens became crimson and gold and tinted the lilies with the hue of roses then the beautiful maidens offered to the prince sparkling wine and when he had drank he felt happiness greater than he had ever known before presently the background of the hall opened and the tree of knowledge appeared surrounded by a halo of glory that almost blinded him voices soft and lovely as his sounded in his ears as if she were singing to him my child my beloved child then the fairy beckoned to him and said in sweet accents come with me come with me 
 forgetting his promise forgetting it even on the very first evening he rushed towards her while she continued to beckon to him and to smile the fragrance around him overpowered his senses the music from the harps sounded more entrancing while around the tree appeared millions of smiling faces nodding and singing man should know everything man is the lord of the earth the tree of knowledge no longer wept tears of blood for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars 
 
 come come continued that thrilling voice and the prince 
 followed the call at every step his cheeks glowed and the blood 
 rushed wildly through his veins i must follow he cried it is not 
 a sin it cannot be to follow beauty and joy i only want to see 
 her sleep and nothing will happen unless i kiss her and that i 
 will not do for i have strength to resist and a determined will 
 the fairy threw off her dazzling attire bent back the boughs and 
 in another moment was hidden among them 
 
 i have not sinned yet said the prince and i will not and 
 then he pushed aside the boughs to follow the princess she was 
 lying already asleep beautiful as only a fairy in the garden of 
 paradise could be she smiled as he bent over her and he saw tears 
 trembling out of her beautiful eyelashes do you weep for me he 
 whispered oh weep not thou loveliest of women now do i begin to understand the happiness of paradise i feel it to my inmost soul 
 in every thought a new life is born within me one moment of such 
 happiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe he stooped and 
 kissed the tears from her eyes and touched her lips with his 
 a clap of thunder loud and awful resounded through the trembling 
 air all around him fell into ruin the lovely fairy the beautiful 
 garden sunk deeper and deeper the prince saw it sinking down in 
 the dark night till it shone only like a star in the distance beneath him then he felt a coldness like death creeping over him his eyes closed and he became insensible 
 
 when he recovered a chilling rain was beating upon him and a 
 sharp wind blew on his head alas what have i done he sighed i 
 have sinned like adam and the garden of paradise has sunk into the 
 earth he opened his eyes and saw the star in the distance but it 
 was the morning star in heaven which glittered in the darkness 
 
 presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of the 
 forest close to the cavern of the winds and the mother of the 
 winds sat by his side she looked angry and raised her arm in the air 
 as she spoke the very first evening she said well i expected 
 it if you were my son you should go into the sack 
 
 and there he will have to go at last said a strong old man 
 with large black wings and a scythe in his hand whose name was 
 death he shall be laid in his coffin but not yet i will allow 
 him to wander about the world for a while to atone for his sin and 
 to give him time to become better but i shall return when he least 
 expects me i shall lay him in a black coffin place it on my head 
 and fly away with it beyond the stars there also blooms a garden of 
 paradise and if he is good and pious he will be admitted but if 
 his thoughts are bad and his heart is full of sin he will sink 
 with his coffin deeper than the garden of paradise has sunk once in 
 every thousand years i shall go and fetch him when he will either 
 be condemned to sink still deeper or be raised to a happier life in 
 the world beyond the stars

 of judicature 
 judges ought to remember that their office is ius dicere and not ius dare to 
 interpret law and not to make law or give law else will it be like the authority 
 claimed by the church of rome which under pretext of exposition of scripture doth not stick to add and alter and to pronounce that which they do not find and by show of antiquity to introduce novelty judges ought to be more learned than witty more reverent than plausible and more advised than confident above all things integrity is their portion and proper virtue cursed saith the law is he that 
 removeth the landmark 
 the mislayer of a mere stone is to blame but it is the unjust judge that is the capital remover of landmarks when he defineth amiss of lands and property one foul sentence doth more hurt than many foul examples for these do but corrupt the stream the other corrupted the fountain so saith solomon fons twbatus et vena corrupta est iustus cadens in causa sua coram adversario 
 the office of judges may have reference unto the parties that sue unto me advocates that plead unto the clerks and ministers of justice underneath them and to the sovereign or state above them 
 
 first for the causes or parties that sue there be saith the scripture that turn 
 judgement into wormwood and surely there be also that turn it into vinegar for 
 injustice maketh it bitter and delays make it sour the principal duty of a judge 
 is to suppress force and fraud whereof force is the more pernicious when it is open and fraud when it is close and disguised 
 add thereto contentious suits which ought to be spewed out as the surfeit of courts a judge ought to prepare his way to a just sentence as god useth to prepare his way by raising valleys and taking down hills so when there appeared on eidier side an high hand violent prosecution cunning advantages taken 
 combination power great counsel then is the virtue of a judge seen to make 
 inequality equal that he may plant his judgement as upon an even ground qui fortiter emungit elicit sangwiem and where the winepress is hard wrought it yields a harsh wine that tastes of the grapestone judges must beware of hard constructions and strained inferences for there is no worse torture than the torture of laws 
 
 specially in case of laws penal they ought to have care that that which was meant 
 for terror be not turned into rigour and that they bring not upon the people that 
 shower whereof the scripture speaketh plwt supa eos laqueos for penal laws pressed are a shower of snares upon the people 
 therefore let penal laws if they have been sleepers of long or if they be grown unfit for the present time be by wise judges confined in me execution cffidum est ut res ita tempora renon c in causes of life and death judges ought as far as the law permitteth in justice to remember mercy and to cast 
 a severe eye upon the example but a merciful eye upon the person 
 
 secondly for me advocates and counsel that plead patience and gravity of hearing 
 is an essential part of justice and an overspeaking judge is no well tuned cymbal 
 it is no grace to a judge first to find that which he might have heard in due time 
 from the bar or to show quickness of conceit in cutting off evidence or counsel too short or to prevent information by questions though pertinent the parts of a judge in hearing are four to direct the evidence to moderate length repetition or 
 impertinency of speech to recapitulate select and collate the material points of 
 that which ham been said and to give the rule or sentence 
 whatsoever is above these is too much and proceedeth either of glory and willingness to speak or of impatience to hear or of shortness of memory or of want of a staid and equal attention it is a strange thing to see that the boldness of advocates should prevail with judges whereas they should imitate god in whose seat they sit who represseth the presumptuous and giveth grace to the modest but it is more strange that judges should have noted favourites which cannot but cause multiplication of fees and suspicion of byways 
 there is due from the judge to me advocate some commendation and gracing where causes are well handled and fair pleaded especially towards the side which obtainem not for that upholds in the client the reputation of his counsel 
 and beats down in him the conceit of his cause there is likewise due to the public a civil reprehension of advocates where there appeared cunning counsel gross neglect slight information indiscreet pressing or an defence and let not the counsel at the bar chop with the judge nor wind himself into he handling of the cause anew after the judge hath declared his sentence but on the other side let not the judge meet the cause half way nor give occasion to the party to say his counsel or proofs were not heard 
 
 thirdly for that that concerns clerks and ministers the place of justice is an 
 hallowed place and therefore not only the bench but the footpace and precincts 
 and purprise thereof ought to be preserved without scandal and corruption for 
 certainly graves as the scripture sailh will not be gathered of thorns or thistles 
 neither can justice yield her fruit with sweetness amongst the briars and brambles 
 of catching and polling clerks and ministers 
 the attendance of courts is subject to four bad instruments first certain persons that are the sowers of suits which make the court swell and the country pine the second sort is of those that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction and are not truly anidcuriae bvxpcaiasitiaiiiae in puffing a court up beyond her bounds for their own scraps and advantage 
 the third sort is of those that may be accounted the left hands of courts persons that are full of nimble and sinister tricks and shifts whereby they pervert the plain 
 and direct courses of courts and bring justice into oblique lines and labyrinths 
 and the fourth is the poller and exacter of fees which justifies the common 
 resemblance of the courts of justice to the bush whereunto while the sheep flies 
 for defence in weather he is sure to lose part of his fleece on the other side 
 an ancient clerk skilful in precedents wary in proceeding and understanding in 
 the business of the court is an excellent finger of a court and doth many times 
 point the way to the judge himself 
 
 fourthly for that which may concern the sovereign and estate judges ought above 
 all to remember the conclusion of the roman twelve tables sahispcpuli supremo lex and to know that laws except they be in order to that end are but things captious and oracles not well inspired 
 therefore it is an happy thing in a state when kings and states do often consult with judges and again when judges do often consult with the king and state the one when there is matter of law intervenient in business of state the other when there is some consideration of state intervenient in matter of law for many times the things deduced to judgement may be moon and tuum when the reason and consequence thereof may trench to point of estate i call matter of estate not only the parts of sovereignty but whatsoever introduceth any great alteration or dangerous precedent or concemeth manifestly any great portion of people and let no man weakly conceive that just laws and true policy have any antipathy for they are like the spirits and sinews that one moves with the other 
 
 let judges also remember that throne was supported by lions on both sides let them be lions but yet lions under the throne being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty let not judges also be so ignorant of their own right as to think there is not left to them as a principal part of 
 their office a wise use and application of laws for they may remember what the 
 apostle saith of a greater law than theirs nos sdmus qwa lex bona est

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter i 
 
 sister simplice 
 the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at m sur m but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we preserve out of respect for the truth 
 on the afternoon following the visit of javert m madeleine went to see fantine according to his wont 
 before entering room he had sister simplice summoned 
 the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazariste ladies like all sisters of charity bore the names of sister perpetue and sister simplice 
 sister perpetue was an ordinary villager a sister of charity in a coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters any other service 
 she was a nun as other women are cooks this type is not so very rare 
 the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline 
 these rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion 
 the transition from a drover to a carmelite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk 
 a little more amplitude in the smock and it becomes a frock 
 sister perpetue was a robust nun from marines near pontoise who chattered her patois droned grumbled sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was crabbed with the dying almost flung god in their faces stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage was bold honest and ruddy 
 sister simplice was white with a waxen pallor 
 beside sister perpetue she was the taper beside the candle 
 vincent de paul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude 
 they shall have for their convent only the house of the sick for cell only a hired room for chapel only their parish church for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals for enclosure only obedience for gratings only the fear of god for veil only modesty 
 this ideal was realized in the living person of sister simplice 
 she had never been young and it seemed as though she would never grow old no one could have told sister age 
 she was a person we dare not say a was gentle austere cold and who had never lied 
 she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than granite 
 she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine 
 there was so to speak silence in her speech she said just what was necessary and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a this delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of god 
 let us emphasize one detail never to have lied never to have said for any interest whatever even in indifference any single thing which was not the truth the sacred truth was sister distinctive trait it was the accent of her virtue 
 she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity 
 the abbe sicard speaks of sister simplice in a letter to the massieu however pure and sincere we may be we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little innocent lie 
 she did not 
 little lie innocent such a thing exist 
 to lie is the absolute form of evil 
 to lie a little is not possible 
 he who lies lies the whole lie 
 to lie is the very face of the demon 
 satan has two names he is called satan and lying 
 that is what she thought and as she thought so she did 
 the result was the whiteness which we have whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance 
 her smile was white her glance was white there was not a single web not a grain of dust on the glass window of that conscience 
 on entering the order of saint vincent de paul she had taken the name of simplice by special choice simplice of sicily as we know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse a lie which would have saved her 
 this patron saint suited this soul 
 sister simplice on her entrance into the order had had two faults which she had gradually corrected 
 she had a taste for dainties and she liked to receive letters 
 she never read anything but a book of prayers printed in latin in coarse type she did not understand latin but she understood the book 
 this pious woman had conceived an affection for fantine probably feeling a latent virtue there and she had devoted herself almost exclusively to her care 
 m madeleine took sister simplice apart and recommended fantine to her in a singular tone which the sister recalled later on 
 on leaving the sister he approached fantine 
 fantine awaited m appearance every day as one awaits a ray of warmth and joy 
 she said to the sisters i only live when monsieur le maire is here 
 she had a great deal of fever that day 
 as soon as she saw m madeleine she asked him 
 and cosette 
 he replied with a smile 
 soon 
 m madeleine was the same as usual with fantine 
 only he remained an hour instead of half an hour to great delight he urged every one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything 
 it was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre 
 but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground fast 
 then he returned to the and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of france which hung in his study he wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil

 book three 
 chapter vii 
 
 on the twelfth of november active army in camp before olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors the russian and the austrian the guards just arrived from russia spent the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review reaching the field at olmutz by ten 
 that day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris telling him that the ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops after their active service were stationed near olmutz and the camp swarmed with sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of tempting wares the pavlograds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses rostov who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought horse bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and the sutlers on receiving boris letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmutz dined there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the guards camp to find his old playmate rostov had not yet had time to get his uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a cross equally shabby riding breeches lined with worn leather and an saber with a sword knot the don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head as he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress boris and all his comrades of the guards by his appearance that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire 
 the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline they had come by easy stages their knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper posts boris had been quartered and had marched all the way with berg who was already in command of a company berg who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in staff berg and boris having rested after march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess berg held a smoking pipe between his knees boris in the accurate way characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting move and watched his face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on 
 well how are you going to get out of that he remarked 
 try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing his hand 
 at that moment the door opened 
 here he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh you petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian french at which he and boris used to laugh long ago 
 dear me how you have changed 
 boris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace his friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youth that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did but notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times 
 they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young men take their first steps on road each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them 
 oh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if been to a fete not like us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his own breeches the german landlady hearing loud voice popped her head in at the door 
 eh is she pretty he asked with a wink 
 why do you shout so frighten them said boris i did not expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday by bolkonski an adjutant of a friend of mine i did not think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you been under fire already asked boris 
 without answering rostov shook the cross of st george fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm glanced at berg with a smile 
 as you see he said 
 indeed yes yes said boris with a smile and we too have had a splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls i tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers 
 and the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the imperial family 
 oh you guards said rostov i say send for some wine 
 boris made a grimace 
 if you really want it said he 
 he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent for wine 
 yes and i have some money and a letter to give you he added 
 rostov took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines he glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the letter 
 well sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our pay i can tell you for myself 
 i say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with and i happen to be there go at once to be out of your way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance 
 oh mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice 
 go across to our hosts they invited you added boris 
 berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile 
 oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter 
 why 
 oh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them such a fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly well have you sent gabriel for some wine all right have some 
 in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at anna advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it 
 what nonsense much i need it said rostov throwing the letter under the table 
 why have you thrown that away asked boris 
 it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for 
 why what the devil said boris picking it up and reading the address this letter would be of great use to you 
 i want nothing and i be adjutant 
 why not inquired boris 
 a job 
 you are still the same dreamer i see remarked boris shaking his head 
 and still the same diplomatist but not the point come how are you asked rostov 
 well as you see so far all right but i confess i should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front 
 why 
 because when once a man starts on military service he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible 
 oh it said rostov evidently thinking of something else 
 he looked intently and inquiringly into his eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question 
 old gabriel brought in the wine 
 we now send for berg asked boris he would drink with you i 
 well send for him and how do you get on with that german asked rostov with a contemptuous smile 
 he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered boris 
 again rostov looked intently into boris eyes and sighed berg returned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated the guardsmen told rostov of their march and how they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of the grand quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company commander 
 would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and than his did well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the right so i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day what keeping head means the way count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke 
 yes that was fine said rostov smiling 
 but boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about it and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schon grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as it really was rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his hearers who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story they would either not have believed him or still worse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he told them all that 
 in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew whom boris was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent with papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on boris hoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of man he gave boris a pleasant smile frowned as with eyes he looked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere stranger glancing however at boris he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line 
 in spite of prince disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans 
 we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger 
 berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed gaily 
 as to your business prince andrew continued addressing boris we will talk of it later and he looked round at rostov come to me after the review and we will do what is possible 
 and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostov whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were talking of the schon grabern affair were you there 
 i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the 
 bolkonski noticed the state of mind and it amused him with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair 
 yes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown furious now at boris now at bolkonski yes many stories but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the fire our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything 
 of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly amiable smile 
 a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mingled at that moment in soul 
 i am not talking about you he said i know you and frankly i want to i am speaking of the staff in general 
 and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you sufficient but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and besides drubetskoy who says he is an old friend of yours is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the review i shall expect you drubetskoy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out 
 only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the girl who trod on the loaf 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling her 
 shoes and the misfortunes that happened to her in consequence are 
 well known her name was inge she was a poor child but proud and 
 presuming and with a bad and cruel disposition when quite a little 
 child she would delight in catching flies and tearing off their 
 wings so as to make creeping things of them when older she would 
 take cockchafers and beetles and stick pins through them then she 
 pushed a green leaf or a little scrap of paper towards their feet 
 and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it fast and 
 turn over and over in their struggles to get free from the pin she 
 would say the cockchafer is reading see how he turns over the 
 leaf she grew worse instead of better with years and 
 unfortunately she was pretty which caused her to be excused when 
 she should have been sharply reproved 
 
 your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it her mother 
 often said to her as a little child you used to trample on my apron 
 but one day i fear you will trample on my heart and alas this fear 
 was realized 
 
 inge was taken to the house of some rich people who lived at a 
 distance and who treated her as their own child and dressed her so 
 fine that her pride and arrogance increased 
 
 when she had been there about a year her patroness said to her 
 you ought to go for once and see your parents inge 
 
 so inge started to go and visit her parents but she only wanted 
 to show herself in her native place that the people might see how 
 fine she was she reached the entrance of the village and saw the 
 young laboring men and maidens standing together chatting and her own mother amongst them mother was sitting on a stone to rest with a fagot of sticks lying before her which she had picked up in the wood then inge turned back she who was so finely dressed she felt ashamed of her mother a poorly clad woman who picked up wood in the forest she did not turn back out of pity for her 
 poverty but from pride 
 
 another went by and her mistress said you ought to go 
 home again and visit your parents inge and i will give you a 
 large wheaten loaf to take to them they will be glad to see you i am 
 sure 
 
 so inge put on her best clothes and her new shoes drew her dress 
 up around her and set out stepping very carefully that she might be 
 clean and neat about the feet and there was nothing wrong in doing 
 so but when she came to the place where the footpath led across the 
 moor she found small pools of water and a great deal of mud so 
 she threw the loaf into the mud and trod upon it that she might pass 
 without wetting her feet but as she stood with one foot on the loaf 
 and the other lifted up to step forward the loaf began to sink 
 under her lower and lower till she disappeared altogether and 
 only a few bubbles on the surface of the muddy pool remained to show where she had sunk and this is the story 
 
 but where did inge go she sank into the ground and went down 
 to the marsh woman who is always brewing there 
 
 the marsh woman is related to the elf maidens who are 
 for songs are sung and pictures painted about them but of the marsh 
 woman nothing is known excepting that when a mist arises from the 
 meadows in summer time it is because she is brewing beneath them 
 to the marsh brewery inge sunk down to a place which no one can endure for long a heap of mud is a palace compared with the marsh brewery and as inge fell she shuddered in every limb and soon became cold and stiff as marble her foot was still fastened to the loaf which bowed her down as a golden ear of corn bends the stem 
 
 an evil spirit soon took possession of inge and carried her to 
 a still worse place in which she saw crowds of unhappy people 
 waiting in a state of agony for the gates of mercy to be opened to 
 them and in every heart was a miserable and eternal feeling of 
 unrest it would take too much time to describe the various tortures 
 these people suffered but punishment consisted in standing 
 there as a statue with her foot fastened to the loaf she could 
 move her eyes about and see all the misery around her but she 
 could not turn her head and when she saw the people looking at her 
 she thought they were admiring her pretty face and fine clothes for 
 she was still vain and proud but she had forgotten how soiled her 
 clothes had become while in the marsh brewery and that they were covered with mud a snake had also fastened itself in her hair and hung down her back while from each fold in her dress a great toad peeped out and croaked like an asthmatic poodle worse than all was the terrible hunger that tormented her and she could not stoop to break off a piece of the loaf on which she stood no her back was too stiff and her whole body like a pillar of stone and then came creeping over her face and eyes flies without wings she winked and blinked but they could not fly away for their wings had been 
 pulled off this added to the hunger she felt was horrible torture 
 
 if this lasts much longer she said i shall not be able to 
 bear it but it did last and she had to bear it without being 
 able to help herself 
 
 a tear followed by many scalding tears fell upon her head and 
 rolled over her face and neck down to the loaf on which she stood 
 who could be weeping for inge she had a mother in the world still 
 and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her child will always find their way to the heart but they often increase the 
 torment instead of being a relief and inge could hear all that was 
 said about her in the world she had left and every one seemed cruel 
 to her the sin she had committed in treading on the loaf was known on earth for she had been seen by the cowherd from the hill when she was crossing the marsh and had disappeared 
 
 when her mother wept and exclaimed ah inge what grief thou 
 hast caused thy mother she would say oh that i had never been born 
 
 my tears are useless now 
 
 and then the words of the kind people who had adopted her came 
 to her ears when they said inge was a sinful girl who did not 
 value the gifts of god but trampled them under her feet 
 
 ah thought inge they should have punished me and driven 
 all my naughty tempers out of me 
 
 a song was made about the girl who trod on a loaf to keep her 
 shoes from being soiled and this song was sung everywhere the story of her sin was also told to the little children and they called her 
 wicked inge and said she was so naughty that she ought to be 
 punished inge heard all this and her heart became hardened and 
 full of bitterness 
 
 but one day while hunger and grief were gnawing in her hollow 
 frame she heard a little innocent child while listening to the tale 
 of the vain haughty inge burst into tears and exclaim but will she 
 never come up again 
 
 and she heard the reply no she will never come up again 
 
 but if she were to say she was sorry and ask pardon and promise 
 never to do so again asked the little one 
 
 yes then she might come but she will not beg pardon was the 
 answer 
 
 oh i wish she would said the child who was quite unhappy 
 about it i should be so glad i would give up my doll and all my 
 playthings if she could only come here again poor inge it is so 
 dreadful for her 
 
 these pitying words penetrated to inmost heart and 
 seemed to do her good it was the first time any one had said poor 
 inge without saying something about her faults a little innocent 
 child was weeping and praying for mercy for her it made her feel 
 quite strange and she would gladly have wept herself and it added to 
 her torment to find she could not do so and while she thus suffered 
 in a place where nothing changed years passed away on earth and 
 she heard her name less frequently mentioned but one day a sigh 
 reached her ear and the words inge inge what a grief thou hast 
 been to me i said it would be so it was the last sigh of her 
 dying mother 
 
 after this inge heard her kind mistress say ah poor inge 
 shall i ever see thee again perhaps i may for we know not what may 
 happen in the future but inge knew right well that her mistress 
 would never come to that dreadful place 
 
 a long bitter time then inge heard her name 
 pronounced once more and saw what seemed two bright stars shining above her they were two gentle eyes closing on earth many years had passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about poor inge that child was now an old woman whom god was taking to himself in the last hour of existence the events of a whole life often appear before us and this hour the old woman remembered how when a child she had shed tears over the story of inge and she 
 prayed for her now as the eyes of the old woman closed to earth 
 the eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity and 
 then she in whose last thoughts inge had been so vividly present saw 
 how deeply the poor girl had sunk she burst into tears at the 
 sight and in heaven as she had done when a little child on earth 
 she wept and prayed for poor inge her tears and her prayers echoed 
 through the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul 
 and the unexpected mercy was obtained for it through an tears 
 
 as in thought inge seemed to act over again every sin she had 
 committed on earth she trembled and tears she had never yet been 
 able to weep rushed to her eyes it seemed impossible that the gates 
 of mercy could ever be opened to her but while she acknowledged 
 this in deep penitence a beam of radiant light shot suddenly into the 
 depths upon her more powerful than the sunbeam that dissolves the man of snow which the children have raised more quickly than the 
 snowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the warm lips of a 
 child was the stony form of inge changed and as a little bird she 
 soared with the speed of lightning upward to the world of mortals a 
 bird that felt timid and shy to all things around it that seemed to 
 shrink with shame from meeting any living creature and hurriedly 
 sought to conceal itself in a dark corner of an old ruined wall there 
 it sat cowering and unable to utter a sound for it was voiceless yet 
 how quickly the little bird discovered the beauty of everything around 
 it the sweet fresh air the soft radiance of the moon as its 
 light spread over the earth the fragrance which exhaled from bush and tree made it feel happy as it sat there clothed in its fresh 
 bright plumage all creation seemed to speak of beneficence and 
 love the bird wanted to give utterance to thoughts that stirred in 
 his breast as the cuckoo and the nightingale in the spring but it 
 could not yet in heaven can be heard the song of praise even from 
 a worm and the notes trembling in the breast of the bird were as 
 audible to heaven even as the psalms of david before they had 
 fashioned themselves into words and song 
 
 drew near and a peasant who dwelt close by the old 
 wall stuck up a pole with some ears of corn fastened to the top 
 that the birds of heaven might have feast and rejoice in the happy 
 blessed time and on christmas morning the sun arose and shone upon the ears of corn which were quickly surrounded by a number of twittering birds then from a hole in the wall gushed forth in 
 song the swelling thoughts of the bird as he issued from his hiding 
 place to perform his first good deed on earth and in heaven it was 
 well known who that bird was 
 
 the winter was very hard the ponds were covered with ice and 
 there was very little food for either the beasts of the field or the 
 birds of the air our little bird flew away into the public roads and 
 found here and there in the ruts of the sledges a grain of corn and 
 at the halting places some crumbs of these he ate only a few but 
 he called around him the other birds and the hungry sparrows that 
 they too might have food he flew into the towns and looked about 
 and wherever a kind hand had strewed bread on the for 
 the birds he only ate a single crumb himself and gave all the rest 
 to the rest of the other birds in the course of the winter the bird 
 had in this way collected many crumbs and given them to other birds 
 till they equalled the weight of the loaf on which inge had trod to 
 keep her shoes clean and when the last had been found and given the gray wings of the bird became white and spread 
 themselves out for flight 
 
 see yonder is a cried the children when they saw the 
 white bird as it dived into the sea and rose again into the clear 
 sunlight white and glittering but no one could tell whither it 
 went then although some declared it flew straight to the sun

 of anger 
 to seek to extinguish anger utterly is but a bravery of the stoics we have better 
 oracles be angry but sin not let not the sun go down upon your anger anger must be limited and confined both in race and in time we will first speak how the natural inclination and habit to be angry may be attempered and calmed 
 secondly how the particular motions of anger may be repressed or at least refrained from doing mischief 
 thirdly how to raise anger or appease anger in another 
 
 for the first there is no other way but to meditate and ruminate well upon the effects of anger how it troubles life and the best time to do this is to look back upon anger when the fit is thoroughly over seneca saith well that anger is like ruin which forsakes itself upon that it falls the scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in patience whosoever is out of patience is out of possession of his soul men must not turn bees anunasque in vidnereponunt 
 
 anger is certainly a kind of baseness as it appears well in the weakness of those 
 subjects in whom it reigns children women old folks sick folks only men must 
 beware that they cany their anger rather with scorn than with fear so that they 
 may seem rather to be above the injury than below it which is a thing easily done 
 if a man will give law to himself in it 
 
 for the second point the causes and motives of anger are chiefly three first to 
 be too sensible of hurt for no man is angry that feels not himself hurt and therefore tender and delicate persons must needs be oft angry they have so many things to trouble them which more robust natures have little sense of the next is the apprehension and construction of the injury offered to be in the circumstances 
 thereof full of contempt for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon anger as 
 much or more than the hurt itself and therefore when men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of contempt they do kindle their anger much lastly opinion of the touch of a reputation doth multiply and sharpen anger 
 wherein the remedy is that a man should have as consalvo was wont to say tekan bomnscmsaarem but in all refrainings of anger it is the best remedy to win time and to make a self believe that the opportunity of his revenge is not yet come but that he foresees a time for it and so to still himself in the mean time and reserve it to continue anger from mischief though it take hold of a man there be two things whereof you must have special caution the one of extreme bitterness of words especially if they be accurate and proper for communiamalascta are nothing so much and again that in anger a man reveal no secrets for that makes him not fit for society 
 the other that you do not peremptorily break off in any business in a 
 fit of anger but howsoever you show bitterness do not act anything that is not 
 revocable 
 
 for raising and appeasing anger in another it is done chiefly by choosing of times 
 when men are frowardest and worst disposed to incense them again by gathering as was touched before all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt and the two remedies are by the contraries the former to take good times when first to relate to a man an angry business for the first impression is much and the other is to sever as much as may be me construction of the injury from the point of contempt imputing it to misunderstanding fear passion or what you will

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter ii 
 
 the perspicacity of master scaufflaire 
 from the he betook himself to the extremity of the town to a fleming named master scaufflaer french scaufflaire who let out horses and cabriolets as desired 
 in order to reach this scaufflaire the shortest way was to take the street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which m madeleine resided 
 the cure was it was said a worthy respectable and sensible man 
 at the moment when m madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one in the street and this person noticed this 
 after the mayor had passed the house he halted stood motionless then turned about and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage which had an iron knocker 
 he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly he placed it gently and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously 
 m madeleine found master scaufflaire at home engaged in stitching a harness over 
 master scaufflaire he inquired have you a good horse 
 mr mayor said the fleming all my horses are good 
 what do you mean by a good horse 
 i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day 
 the deuce said the fleming 
 twenty leagues 
 yes 
 hitched to a cabriolet 
 yes 
 and how long can he rest at the end of his journey 
 he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary 
 to traverse the same road 
 yes 
 the deuce the deuce 
 and it is twenty leagues 
 m madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures 
 he showed it to the fleming 
 the figures were 
 you see he said total nineteen and a half as well say twenty leagues 
 mr mayor returned the fleming i have just what you want my little white may have seen him pass occasionally he is a small beast from lower boulonnais 
 he is full of fire they wanted to make a of him at first 
 bah 
 he reared he kicked he laid everybody flat on the ground 
 he was thought to be vicious and no one knew what to do with him 
 i bought him i harnessed him to a carriage 
 that is what he wanted sir he is as gentle as a girl he goes like the wind 
 ah indeed he must not be mounted 
 it does not suit his ideas to be a every one has his ambition 
 draw yes 
 carry 
 no we must suppose that is what he said to himself 
 and he will accomplish the trip 
 your twenty leagues all at a full trot and in less than eight hours but here are the conditions 
 state them 
 in the first place 
 you will give him half an breathing spell midway of the road he will eat and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats for i have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses 
 some one will be by 
 in the second the cabriolet for monsieur le maire 
 yes 
 does monsieur le maire know how to drive 
 yes 
 well monsieur le maire will travel alone and without baggage in order not to overload the horse 
 agreed 
 but as monsieur le maire will have no one with him he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen 
 that is understood 
 i am to have thirty francs a day 
 the days of rest to be paid for a farthing less and the food to be at monsieur le expense 
 m madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table 
 here is the pay for two days in advance 
 fourthly for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy and would fatigue the horse 
 monsieur le maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own 
 i consent to that 
 it is light but it has no cover 
 that makes no difference to me 
 has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter 
 m madeleine did not reply 
 the fleming resumed 
 that it is very cold 
 m madeleine preserved silence 
 master scaufflaire continued 
 that it may rain 
 m madeleine raised his head and said 
 the tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door morning at four 
 of course monsieur le maire replied scaufflaire then scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his he resumed with that careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness 
 but this is what i am thinking of now 
 monsieur le maire has not told me where he is going 
 where is monsieur le maire going 
 he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question 
 are your forelegs good said m madeleine 
 yes monsieur le maire 
 you must hold him in a little when going down hill 
 are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going 
 do not forget to be at my door at precisely four morning replied m madeleine and he took his departure 
 the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said some time afterwards 
 the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more 
 he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air 
 monsieur scaufflaire said he at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me the one bearing the other 
 the one dragging the other monsieur le maire said the fleming with a broad smile 
 so be it 
 well 
 does monsieur le maire wish to purchase them or me 
 no but i wish to guarantee you in any case 
 you shall give me back the sum at my return 
 at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet 
 five hundred francs monsieur le maire 
 here it is 
 m madeleine laid a on the table then left the room and this time he did not return 
 master scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs 
 besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns 
 the fleming called his wife and related the affair to her where the devil could monsieur le maire be going 
 they held counsel together 
 he is going to paris said the wife 
 i believe it said the husband 
 m madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay on the the fleming picked it up and studied it five six eight and a half 
 that must designate the posting relays he turned to his wife 
 i have found out 
 what 
 it is five leagues from here to hesdin six from hesdin to eight and a half from to arras 
 he is going to arras 
 meanwhile m madeleine had returned home 
 he had taken the longest way to return from master as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him and he had wished to avoid it 
 he ascended to his room and there he shut himself up which was a very simple act since he liked to go to bed early 
 nevertheless the portress of the factory who was at the same time m only servant noticed that the light was extinguished at eight and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home adding 
 is monsieur le maire ill 
 i thought he had a rather singular air 
 this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m chamber 
 he paid no heed to the words but went to bed and to sleep 
 towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head 
 he listened it was a footstep pacing back and forth as though some one were walking in the room above him 
 he listened more attentively and recognized m step 
 this struck him as strange usually there was no noise in m chamber until he rose in the morning 
 a moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and then shut again then a piece of furniture was disarranged then a pause ensued then the step began again 
 the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now and staring and through his he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the rays it could only come from the window of m chamber 
 the reflection wavered as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle the shadow of the was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open 
 the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising 
 the cashier fell asleep again an hour or two later he waked again 
 the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead 
 the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle the window was still open 
 this is what had taken place in m room

 book three 
 chapter viii 
 
 the day after rostov had been to see boris a review was held of the austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and those who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors the russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the archduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men 
 from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up on the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth felt that no small matter was happening but an important and solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole 
 from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten all had been brought into due order the ranks were drown up on the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry 
 a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished fighting army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front those recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the line and the austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines under one command and in a like order 
 like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper coming coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops 
 from the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seen approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting eyes front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent 
 in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this was the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst into music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the first regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted 
 rostov standing in the front lines of army which the tsar approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army a feeling of a proud consciousness of might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph 
 he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word 
 hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then hurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar 
 till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two men the emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated 
 the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted attention 
 rostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had recognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twenty paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every movement of the seemed to him enchanting 
 stopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in french to the austrian emperor and smiled 
 seeing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him 
 oh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought rostov i should die of happiness 
 the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen i thank you with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like a voice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar 
 you have earned the st standards and will be worthy of them 
 oh to die to die for him thought rostov 
 the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the soldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrah 
 rostov too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all his might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if only to express his rapture fully 
 the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided 
 how can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything else the tsar did 
 that hesitation lasted only an instant the foot in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at last only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the emperors 
 among the gentlemen of the suite rostov noticed bolkonski sitting his horse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge bolkonski of course not he now thought is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such love such rapture and such what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now 
 when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a ceremonial march past him and rostov on bedouin recently purchased from denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadron that is alone and in full view of the emperor 
 before he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman spurred bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the eye upon him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful action as if flying through the air without touching the ground 
 rostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but blissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed it 
 fine fellows the pavlograds remarked the emperor 
 my god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant thought rostov 
 when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the essen corps arrived and prussia took our side 
 but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his every word and movement was described with ecstasy 
 they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the command commanded by the emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought rostov and most of the officers after the review 
 all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the goblin and the huckster 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a regular student who lived in a garret and had 
 no possessions and there was also a regular huckster to whom the 
 house belonged and who occupied the ground floor a goblin lived with the huckster because at christmas he always had a large dish full 
 of jam with a great piece of butter in the middle the huckster could 
 afford this and therefore the goblin remained with the huckster 
 which was very cunning of him 
 
 one evening the student came into the shop through the back door 
 to buy candles and cheese for himself he had no one to send and 
 therefore he came himself he obtained what he wished and then the 
 huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him and she was a 
 woman who could do more than merely nod for she had usually plenty to say for herself the student nodded in return as he turned to leave then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped it was a leaf torn out of an old book a book that ought not to have been torn up for it was full of poetry 
 
 yonder lies some more of the same sort said the huckster i 
 gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it you shall have the rest 
 for sixpence if you will 
 
 indeed i will said the student give me the book instead of 
 the cheese i can eat my bread and butter without cheese it would 
 be a sin to tear up a book like this you are a clever man and a 
 practical man but you understand no more about poetry than that 
 cask yonder 
 
 this was a very rude speech especially against the cask but 
 the huckster and the student both laughed for it was only said in 
 fun but the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say 
 such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best 
 butter as soon as it was night and the shop closed and every one in 
 bed except the student the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom 
 where the wife slept and took away her tongue which of 
 course she did not then want whatever object in the room he placed 
 his tongue upon immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do it could only be used by one object at a time which was a good thing as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion 
 
 the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask in which lay a quantity of 
 old newspapers 
 
 is it really true he asked that you do not know what poetry 
 is 
 
 of course i know replied the cask poetry is something that 
 always stand in the corner of a newspaper and is sometimes cut out 
 and i may venture to affirm that i have more of it in me than the 
 student has and i am only a poor tub of the 
 
 then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill and how it 
 did go to be sure then he put it on the butter tub and the cash 
 box and they all expressed the same opinion as the tub 
 and a majority must always be respected 
 
 now i shall go and tell the student said the goblin and with 
 these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where the 
 student lived he had a candle burning still and the goblin peeped 
 through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book 
 which he had brought out of the shop but how light the room was from the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full like the stem of a tree from which bright rays spread upward and over the head each leaf was fresh and each flower was like a beautiful female head some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear the fruit gleamed like stars and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music the little goblin had never imagined much less seen or heard of any sight so glorious as this he stood still on tiptoe peeping in 
 till the light went out in the garret the student no doubt had 
 blown out his candle and gone to bed but the little goblin remained 
 standing there nevertheless and listening to the music which still 
 sounded on soft and beautiful a sweet for the student 
 who had lain down to rest 
 
 this is a wonderful place said the goblin i never expected 
 such a thing i should like to stay here with the student and the 
 little man thought it over for he was a sensible little spirit at 
 last he sighed but the student has no jam so he went down stairs 
 again into the shop and it was a good thing he got back 
 when he did for the cask had almost worn out the tongue he 
 had given a description of all that he contained on one side and 
 was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what 
 was there when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the 
 lady but from that time forward the whole shop from the cash box 
 down to the pinewood logs formed their opinions from that of the 
 cask and they all had such confidence in him and treated him with so 
 much respect that when the huckster read the criticisms on 
 theatricals and art of an evening they fancied it must all come 
 from the cask 
 
 but after what he had seen the goblin could no longer sit and 
 listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs so as 
 soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret he took courage 
 for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables 
 drawing him up and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole and while there a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the sea when the storm breaks forth and it brought tears into his eyes he did not himself know why he wept yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears how 
 wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under such 
 a tree but that was out of the question he must be content to 
 look through the keyhole and be thankful for even that 
 
 there he stood on the old landing with the autumn wind blowing 
 down upon him through the it was very cold but the 
 little creature did not really feel it till the light in the garret 
 went out and the tones of music died away then how he shivered 
 and crept down stairs again to his warm corner where it felt 
 and comfortable and when christmas came again and 
 brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter he liked the 
 huckster best of all 
 
 soon after in the middle of the night the goblin was awoke by 
 a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and the 
 house doors and by the sound of the horn for a great fire had broken out and the whole street appeared full of flames was it in their house or a no one could tell for terror had 
 seized upon all the wife was so bewildered that she took 
 her gold out of her ears and put them in her pocket that 
 she might save something at least the huckster ran to get his 
 business papers and the servant resolved to save her blue silk 
 mantle which she had managed to buy each wished to keep the best 
 things they had the goblin had the same wish for with one spring 
 he was up stairs and in the room whom he found standing 
 by the open window and looking quite calmly at the fire which was 
 raging at the house of a neighbor opposite the goblin caught up the 
 wonderful book which lay on the table and popped it into his red cap which he held tightly with both hands the greatest treasure in the house was saved and he ran away with it to the roof and seated 
 himself on the chimney the flames of the burning house opposite 
 illuminated him as he sat both hands pressed tightly over his cap in 
 which the treasure lay and then he found out what feelings really 
 reigned in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended and yet when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect he hesitated and said at last i must divide myself between the two i cannot quite give up the huckster because of the jam 
 
 and this is a representation of human nature we are like the 
 goblin we all go to visit the huckster because of the jam

 of vicissitude of things 
 solomon saith there is no new thing upon the earth so that as plato had an imagination that all knowledge was but remembrance so solomon giveth his sentence that all novelty is but oblivion 
 whereby you may see that the river of lethe runneth as well above ground as below there is an abstruse astrologer that saith if it were not for two things that are constant the one is that he fixed stars ever stand at like distance one from another and never come nearer together nor go further asunder the other that the diurnal motion perpetually keepeth time no individual would last one moment 
 certain it is that the matter is in a perpetual flux and never at a stay the great that bury all things in oblivion are two deluges and earthquakes as for conflagrations and great droughts they do not merely dispeople and destroy car went but a day and the three years drought in the time of elias was but particular and left people alive 
 as for the great burnings by lightnings which are often in the west indies they are but narrow 
 
 but in the other two destructions by deluge and earthquake it is further to be 
 noted that the remnant of people which hap to be preserved are commonly ignorant and mountainous people that can give no account of the time past so that the oblivion is all one as if none had been left if you consider well of the people of the west indies it is very probable that they are newer or a younger people than the people of the old world and it is much more likely that the destruction that hath heretofore been there was not by earthquakes as the egyptian priest told solon concerning the island of auantis that it was swallowed by an earthquake but rather that it was desolated by a particular deluge for earthquakes are seldom in those parts but on the other side they have such pouring rivers as the rivers of asia and africa and europe are but brooks to them their andes likewise or mountains arc far higher than those with us 
 
 whereby it seems that the remnants of generation of men were in such a particular 
 deluge saved as for the observation that macbeth hath that the jealousies of sects doth much extinguish the memory of things traducing gregory the great that he did what in him lay to extinguish all heathen antiquities i do not find that those zeals do any great effects nor last long as it appeared in the succession of sabinian who did revive the former antiquities 
 
 the vicissitudes or mutations in the superior globe are no fit matter for this present 
 argument it may be great year if the world should last so long would have some effect not in renewing the state of like individuals for that is the fume of those that conceive the celestial bodies have more accurate influences upon these things below than indeed they have but in gross comets out of question have likewise power and effect over the gross and mass things but they are rather gazed upon and waited upon in their journey than wisely observed in their effects 
 specially in their respective effects that is what kind of comet for magnitude colour version of the beams placing in the region of heaven or lasting produceth what kind of effects 
 there is a toy which i have heard and i would not have it given over but waited 
 upon a little they say it is observed in the low countries i know not in what part that every five and thirty years the same kind and suit of years and weathers comes about again as great frosts great wet great droughts warm winters summers with little heat and the like and they call it the prime it is a thing i do the rather mention because computing backwards i have found some concurrence 
 
 but to leave these points of nature and to come to men the greatest vicissitude 
 of things amongst men is the vicissitude of sects and religions for those orbs rule 
 in minds most the true religion is built upon the rock the rest are tossed 
 upon the waves of time to speak therefore of the causes of new sects and to give some counsel concerning them as far as the weakness of human judgement can give stay to so great revolutions 
 
 when the religion formerly received is rent by discords and when the holiness of 
 the professors of religion is decayed and full of scandal and withal the times be stupid ignorant and barbarous you may doubt the springing up of a new sect if then also there should arise any extravagant and strange spirit to make himself author thereof all which points held when mohammed published his 
 law if a new sect have not two properties fear it not for it will not spread the 
 one is the supplanting or the opposing of authority established for nothing is 
 more popular than that the other is the giving licence to pleasures and a voluptuous life for as for speculative heresies such as were in ancient times the arians and now the armenians though they work mightily upon wits yet they do not produce any great alterations in states except it be by the help of civil occasions 
 there be three manner of plantations of new sects by the power of signs and miracles by the eloquence and wisdom of speech and persuasion and by the sword for martyrdoms i reckon them amongst miracles because they seem to exceed the strength of human nature and i may do the like of superlative and admirable holiness of life 
 surely there is no better way to stop the rising of new sects and schisms than to reform abuses to compound the smaller differences to proceed mildly and not with sanguinary prosecutions and rather to take off the principal authors by winning and advancing them than to enrage them by violence and bitterness 
 
 the changes and vicissitude in wars are many but chiefly in three things in the 
 seats or stages of the war in the weapons and in the manner of the conduct wars 
 in ancient time seemed more to move from east to west for the persians assyrians arabians tartars which were the invaders were all eastern people it is true the gauls were western but we read but of two incursions of theirs the one to the other to rome but east and west have no certain points of heaven and no more have the wars either from the east or west any certainty of observation 
 
 but north and south are fixed and it hath seldom or never been seen that the far 
 southern people have invaded the northern but contrariwise whereby it is manifest mat the northern tract of the world is in nature the more martial region 
 be it in respect of the stars of that hemisphere or of the great continents that 
 are upon the north whereas the south part for ought that is known is almost all 
 sea or which is most apparent of the cold of the northern parts which is that 
 which without aid of discipline doth make the bodies hardest and me courages warmest 
 
 upon the breaking and shivering of a great state and empire you may be sure to have wars for great empires while they stand do enervate and destroy the forces of the natives which they have subdued resting upon their own protecting forces and then when they fail also all goes to ruin and they become a prey so was it in the decay of the roman empire and likewise in the empire of almaigne after charles the great every bird taking a feather and were not unlike to befall to spain if it should break the great accessions and unions of kingdoms do likewise stir up quarrel 
 for when a state grows to an it is like a great flood that will be sure to 
 overflow as it hath been seen in the states of rome turkey spain and others 
 look when the world hath fewest barbarous peoples but such as commonly will not many or generate except they know means to live as it is almost everywhere at this day except tartary there is no danger of inundations of people but when there be great shoals of people which go on to populate without foreseeing means of life and sustentation it is of necessity that once in an age or two they discharge a portion of their people upon other nations which the ancient northern people were wont to do by lot casting lots what part should stay at home and what should seek their fortunes when a warlike state grows soft and effeminate they may be sure of a war 
 
 for commonly such states are grown rich in the time of their degenerating and so 
 the prey inviteth and their decay in valour encourageth a war 
 
 as for the weapons it hardly falleth under rule and observation yet we see even 
 they have returns and vicissitudes for certain it is that ordnance was known in 
 the city of the oxidrakes in india and was that which the macedonians called thunder and lightning and magic and it is well known that the use of ordnance hath been in china above two thousand years the conditions of weapons and their improvement are first the fetching a far off for that outruns the danger as it is seen in ordnance and muskets secondly the strength of the percussion wherein likewise ordnance do exceed all arietations and ancient inventions the third is the 
 commodious use of them as that they may serve in all weathers that the carriage 
 may be light and manageable and the like 
 
 for the conduct of the war at the first men rested extremely upon number they did put the wars likewise upon main force and valour pointing days for pitched fields and so trying it out upon an even match and they were more ignorant in ranging and arraying their battles after they grew to rest upon number rather competent than vast they grew to advantages of place cunning diversions and the like and they grew more skilful in the ordering of their battles hi the youth of a state arms do flourish in the middle age of a state learning and then both of them together for a time in the declining age of a state mechanical arts and merchandise learning hath his infancy when it is but beginning and almost childish then his youth when it is luxuriant and juvenile then his strength of years when it is solid and reduced and lastly his old age when it waxeth dry and exhaust but it is not good to look too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude lest we become giddy as for the philology of them mat is but a circle of tales and therefore not fit for this writing 
 a fragment of an essay of fame the poets make fame a monster they describe her in part finely and elegantly and in part gravely and sentendously they say look how many feathers she hath so many eyes she hath underneath so many tongues so many voices she pricks up so many ears 
 
 this is a flourish there follow excellent parables as that she gathereth strength 
 in going that she goeth upon the ground and yet hideth her head in the clouds 
 that in the day time she sitteth in a watch tower and flieth most by night that she 
 mingleth things done with things not done and that she is a terror to great cities 
 but that which passeth all the rest is they do recount that the earth mother of 
 the giants that made war against jupiter and were by him destroyed thereupon in 
 an anger brought forth fame for certain it is that rebels figured by the giants 
 and seditious fames and libels are but brothers and sisters masculine and 
 feminine but now if a man can tame this matter and bring her to feed at the hand 
 and govern her and with her fly other ravening fowl and kill them it is somewhat 
 worth but we are infected with the style of the poets to speak now in a sad and 
 serious manner there is not in all the politics a place less handled and more 
 worthy to be handled than this of fame we will theretofore speak of these points 
 
 what are false fames and what are true fames and how they may be best discerned how fames may be sown and raised how they may be spread and multiplied and how they may be checked and laid dead and other things concerning the nature of fame 
 
 fame is of that force as there is scarcely any great action wherein it hath not a 
 great part especially in the war mucianus undid vitellius by a fame that he 
 scattered that vitellius had in purpose to remove the legions of syria into germany and the regions of germany into syria whereupon the legions of syria were infinitely inflamed julius caesar took pompey unprovided and laid asleep his industry and preparations by a fame that he cunningly gave out how own soldiers loved him not and being wearied with the wars and laden with the spoils of gaul would forsake him as soon as he came into italy livia settled all things for the succession of her son tiberius by continual giving out that her husband augustus was upon recovery and amendment and it is an usual thing with the bashaws to conceal the death of the great turk from the janissaries and men of war to save the sacking of constantinople and other towns as their manner is themistocles made xerxes king of persia post apace out ofgraecia by giving out that the grecians had a purpose to break his bridge of ships which he made athwart hellespont there be a thousand such like examples 
 and the more they are the less they need to be repeated because a man meeteth with them everywhere therefore let all wise governors have as great a watch and care over fames as they have of the actions and designs themselves

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter iii 
 
 a tempest in a skull 
 the reader has no doubt already divined that m madeleine is no other than jean valjean 
 we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has now come when we must take another look into it we do so not without emotion and trepidation 
 there is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more mysterious and more infinite 
 there is a spectacle more grand than the sea it is heaven 
 there is a spectacle more grand than heaven it is the inmost recesses of the soul 
 to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to a single man were it only in connection with the basest of men would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic conscience is the chaos of chimeras of lusts and of temptations the furnace of dreams the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium of sophisms it is the battlefield of the passions penetrate at certain hours past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that obscurity 
 there beneath that external silence battles of giants like those recorded in homer are in progress skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton visionary circles as in dante 
 what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life 
 alighieri one day met with a door before which he hesitated 
 here is one before us upon whose threshold we hesitate let us enter nevertheless 
 we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais from that moment forth he was as we have seen a totally different man what the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out it was more than a transformation it was a transfiguration 
 he succeeded in disappearing sold the silver reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir crept from town to town traversed france came to m sur m conceived the idea which we have mentioned accomplished what we have related succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible and thenceforth established at m sur m happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last he lived in peace reassured and hopeful having henceforth only two conceal his name and to sanctify his life to escape men and to return to god 
 these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions 
 in general they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life they turned him towards the gloom they rendered him kindly and simple they counselled him to the same things 
 sometimes however they conflicted 
 in that case as the reader will remember the man whom all the country of m sur m called m madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the security to his virtue 
 thus in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence he had preserved the candlesticks worn mourning for him summoned and interrogated all the little savoyards who passed that way collected information regarding the families at faverolles and saved old life despite the disquieting insinuations of javert 
 it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just that his first duty was not towards himself 
 at the same time it must be confessed nothing just like this had yet presented itself 
 never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating engaged in so serious a struggle he understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by javert when the latter entered his study 
 at the moment when that name which he had buried beneath so many layers was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks 
 he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault 
 he felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head as he listened to javert the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champmathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh 
 then it passed away and he said to himself we will see 
 we will see 
 he repressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism 
 it would be beautiful no doubt after the holy words after so many years of repentance and abnegation in the midst of a penitence admirably begun if this man had not flinched for an instant even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice at the bottom of which lay heaven that would have been beautiful but it was not thus 
 we must render an account of the things which went on in this soul and we can only tell what there was there he was carried away at first by the instinct of he rallied all his ideas in haste stifled his emotions took into consideration presence that great danger postponed all decision with the firmness of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler 
 he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquillity without 
 he took no preservative measures as they may be called 
 everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain 
 his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow 
 he repaired to bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his visit through a kindly instinct telling himself that he must behave thus and recommend her well to the sisters in case he should be obliged to be absent himself 
 he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to arras and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the tilbury from scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event 
 he dined with a good deal of appetite 
 on returning to his room he communed with himself 
 he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door 
 he feared lest something more should enter he was barricading himself against possibilities 
 a moment later he extinguished his light it embarrassed him 
 lt seemed to him as though he might be seen 
 by whom 
 alas 
 that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience 
 his conscience that is to say god 
 nevertheless he deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible 
 then he took possession of himself 
 he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark 
 where do i stand 
 am not i dreaming 
 what have i heard 
 is it really true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that manner 
 who can that champmathieu be 
 so he resembles me is it possible 
 when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspecting anything 
 what was i doing yesterday at this hour 
 what is there in this incident 
 what will the end be what is to be done 
 this was the torment in which he found himself 
 his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them 
 nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution 
 his head was burning 
 he went to the window and threw it wide open there were no stars in the sky 
 he returned and seated himself at the table 
 the first hour passed in this manner 
 gradually however vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the the whole situation but some of the details 
 he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it 
 this only caused an increase of his stupor 
 independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name 
 that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him knows perhaps even his new soul within him also 
 he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible 
 assuredly if any one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that that name would not menace him that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense that this rent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other result so far as he was concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and more respected than any one had told him that he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman 
 well all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things 
 his revery continued to grow clearer 
 he came more and more to an understanding of his position 
 it seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss 
 he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger a man unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more it was necessary that some one himself or that other man should fall into it he had only let things take their course 
 the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the galleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment be had a substitute that it appeared that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself being present in the galleys in the person of that champmathieu present in society under the name of m madeleine he had nothing more to fear provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that champmathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls once never to rise again 
 all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter 
 he hastily relighted his candle 
 well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is there in all that for me to think about 
 i am safe all is over 
 i had but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life and behold that door is walled up forever that javert who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me which had divined me good god and which followed me everywhere that frightful always making a point at me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail 
 henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he has his jean valjean who knows it is even probable that he will wish to leave town and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count for nothing in it 
 ah but where is the misfortune in this upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me 
 after all if it does bring harm to some one that is not my fault in the least 
 it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes it so to be evidently 
 have i the right to disarrange what it has arranged 
 what do i ask now why should i meddle 
 it does not concern me what 
 i am not satisfied but what more do i want 
 the goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to have now attained it is god who wills it i can do nothing against the will of god and why does god will it in order that i may continue what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have returned 
 really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this is evidently what he would have said to me it is settled let things take their course let the good god do as he likes 
 thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pace the room 
 come said he let us think no more about it my resolve is taken but he felt no joy 
 quite the reverse 
 one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore 
 the sailor calls it the tide the guilty man calls it remorse god upheaves the soul as he does the ocean 
 after the expiration of a few moments do what he would he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him 
 think as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on 
 before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation 
 it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living being who has not done it 
 it may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man and when it returns from conscience to thought it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter he said he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to self talks to self exclaims to self without breaking the external silence there is a great tumult everything about us talks except the mouth 
 the realities of the soul are none the less realities because they are not visible and palpable 
 so he asked himself where he stood 
 he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve 
 he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short was to do everything that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime 
 for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action 
 he spit it out with disgust 
 he continued to question himself 
 he asked himself severely what he had meant by this my object is attained 
 he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object to conceal his name 
 to deceive the police 
 was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done 
 had he not another and a grand object which was the true save not his person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a just man was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon shut the door on his past but he was not shutting it great god he was it by committing an infamous action 
 he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves 
 he was robbing another of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine he was becoming an assassin 
 he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man 
 he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys on the other hand to surrender himself to save that man struck down with so melancholy an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality 
 this must be done 
 he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted 
 there was no longer any need of saying what is the use 
 he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop beheld his conscience so he must go to arras deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the real one 
 alas that was the greatest of sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done sad fate he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men 
 well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us save this man 
 he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud 
 he took his books verified them and put them in order he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen 
 he wrote and sealed a letter and on the envelope it might have been read had there been any one in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte banker rue paris 
 he drew from his secretary a which contained several and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections 
 any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him 
 only occasionally did his lips move at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate 
 when he had finished the letter to m laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the and began his walk once more 
 his revery had not swerved from its course 
 he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance

 book three 
 chapter ix 
 
 the day after the review boris in his best uniform and with his comrade best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkonski wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could preferably that of adjutant to some important personage a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is all very well for rostov whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he reflected 
 he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two emperors were living with their suites households and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world 
 he knew no one and despite his smart uniform all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military men seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be aware of his existence at the quarters of the commander in chief kutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it next day november after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering the house occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in and boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing but in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the door was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another the red stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his head laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on the clavichord sang the tune bolkonski was not there none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing boris the one who was writing and whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went to the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals 
 when he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening to an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost on tiptoe with a obsequious expression on his purple face reporting something 
 very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris prince andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile 
 at that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised that in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was another more important subordination which made this general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more than ever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand 
 i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions when germans start being accurate no end to it 
 boris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known but it the first time he had heard name or even the term dispositions 
 well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have been thinking about you 
 yes i was thinking for some reason boris could not help blushing of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince kuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards be in action he added as if in apology 
 all right all right talk it over replied prince andrew only let me report this business and i shall be at your disposal 
 while prince andrew went to report about the general that gentleman evidently not sharing boris conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away and waited impatiently for prince return from the commander in room 
 you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was no use your going to the commander in chief he would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought boris but nothing more would come of it there will soon be a battalion of us and adjutants but this is what do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it the fact is that now kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing everything is now centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun 
 prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him he very readily took up boris cause and went with him to dolgorukov 
 it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz occupied by the emperors and their retinues 
 that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary to the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by boris arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the council at which the party of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantages were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened was undertaking nothing 
 dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protege but prince dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to boris and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french 
 ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with russian valor what more could be wished for 
 so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonski 
 and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantly 
 is that so and what did he say inquired bolkonski 
 what can he say and so on merely to gain time i tell you he is in our hands certain but what was most amusing he continued with a sudden laugh was that we could not think how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte 
 but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkonski 
 just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you know bilibin a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him as usurper and enemy of mankind 
 dolgorukov laughed merrily 
 only that said bolkonski 
 all the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the address he is a wise and clever fellow 
 what was it 
 to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement francais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction good it 
 yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski 
 oh yes very much my brother knows him dined with him the present emperor more than once in paris and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist you know a combination of french adroitness and italian do you know the tale about him and count markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful 
 and the talkative dolgorukov turning now to boris now to prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassador purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching 
 delightful said bolkonski but i have come to you prince as a petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before prince andrew could finish an came in to summon dolgorukov to the emperor 
 oh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and boris you know i should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of sincere and animated levity but you see another time 
 boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out into the corridor and met coming out of the door of the room by which dolgorukov had entered a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his face gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor 
 who was that asked boris 
 he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of men the minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such men as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out of the palace 
 next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of austerlitz boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the golden treasure 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the wife went into the church she saw the new altar 
 with the painted pictures and the carved angels those upon the canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful as the carved ones and they were painted and gilt into the bargain their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine lovely to behold but the real 
 sunshine was more beautiful still it shone redder clearer through 
 the dark trees when the sun went down it was lovely thus to look 
 at the sunshine of heaven and she looked at the red sun and she 
 thought about it so deeply and thought of the little one whom the 
 stork was to bring and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful and looked and looked and wished that the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it so that it might at least become like one of the 
 shining angels over the altar 
 
 and when she really had the little child in her arms and held 
 it up to its father then it was like one of the angels in the 
 church to behold with hair like gold the gleam of the setting sun 
 was upon it 
 
 my golden treasure my riches my sunshine said the mother and 
 she kissed the shining locks and it sounded like music and song in 
 the room of the drummer and there was joy and life and movement 
 
 the drummer beat a roll a roll of joy and the drum said the 
 that was beaten when there was a fire in the town 
 red hair the little fellow has red hair believe the drum and 
 not what your mother says dub dub 
 
 and the town repeated what the had said 
 the boy was taken to church the boy was christened there was 
 nothing much to be said about his name he was called peter the whole town and the drum too called him peter the boy with the red hair but his mother kissed his red hair and called him her 
 golden treasure 
 
 in the hollow way in the clayey bank many had scratched their 
 names as a remembrance 
 
 celebrity is always something said the drummer and so he 
 scratched his own name there and his little name likewise 
 and the swallows came they had on their long journey seen 
 more durable characters engraven on rocks and on the walls of the 
 temples in hindostan mighty deeds of great kings immortal names 
 so old that no one now could read or speak them remarkable celebrity 
 
 in the clayey bank the martens built their nest they bored 
 holes in the deep declivity and the splashing rain and the thin 
 mist came and crumbled and washed the names away and the name also and that of his little son 
 
 name will last a full year and a half longer said the 
 father 
 
 fool thought the but it only said dub dub dub 
 
 
 he was a boy full of life and gladness this son with 
 the red hair he had a lovely voice he could sing and he sang like a 
 bird in the woodland there was melody and yet no melody 
 
 he must become a chorister boy said his mother he shall 
 sing in the church and stand among the beautiful gilded angels who 
 are like him 
 
 fiery cat said some of the witty ones of the town 
 the drum heard that from the neighbors wives 
 
 go home peter cried the street boys if you sleep in 
 the garret be a fire in the house and the will 
 have to be beaten 
 
 look out for the drumsticks replied peter and small as he 
 was he ran up boldly and gave the foremost such a punch in the 
 body with his fist that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over 
 and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly 
 
 the town musician was very genteel and fine he was the son of the 
 royal he was very fond of peter and would sometimes 
 take him to his home and he gave him a violin and taught him to play 
 it it seemed as if the whole art lay in the fingers and he 
 wanted to be more than a drummer he wanted to become musician to 
 the town 
 
 be a soldier said peter for he was still quite a little 
 lad and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to carry a 
 gun and to be able to march one two one two and to wear a uniform and a sword 
 
 ah you learn to long for the drum dum dum said 
 the drum 
 
 yes if he could only march his way up to be a general observed 
 his father but before he can do that there must be war 
 
 heaven forbid said his mother 
 
 we have nothing to lose remarked the father 
 
 yes we have my boy she retorted 
 
 but suppose he came back a general said the father 
 
 without arms and legs cried the mother no i would rather 
 keep my golden treasure with me 
 
 drum dum dum the and all the other drums were 
 beating for war had come the soldiers all set out and the son of 
 the drummer followed them golden treasure 
 
 the mother wept the father in fancy saw him famous the town 
 musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war but should 
 stay at home and learn music 
 
 said the soldiers and little peter laughed but 
 when one of them sometimes said to another foxey he would bite his teeth together and look another way into the wide world he did not care for the nickname 
 
 the boy was active pleasant of speech and that 
 is the best canteen said his old comrades 
 
 and many a night he had to sleep under the open sky wet through 
 with the driving rain or the falling mist but his good humor never 
 forsook him the sounded all up all up 
 yes he was certainly born to be a drummer 
 
 the day of battle dawned the sun had not yet risen but the 
 morning was come the air was cold the battle was hot there was mist in the air but still more the bullets and shells 
 flew over the soldiers heads and into their heads into their bodies 
 and limbs but still they pressed forward here or there one or 
 other of them would sink on his knees with bleeding temples and a 
 face as white as chalk the little drummer still kept his healthy 
 color he had suffered no damage he looked cheerfully at the dog of 
 the regiment which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole thing 
 had been got up for his amusement and as if the bullets were only 
 flying about that he might have a game of play with them 
 
 march forward march this was the word of command for the 
 drum the word had not yet been given to fall back though they 
 might have done so and perhaps there would have been much sense in it and now at last the word retire was given but our little 
 drummer beat forward march for he had understood the command thus and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum that was a good roll and proved the summons to victory for the men who had already begun to give way 
 
 life and limb were lost in the battle bombshells tore away the 
 flesh in red strips bombshells lit up into a terrible glow the 
 strawheaps to which the wounded had dragged themselves to lie 
 untended for many hours perhaps for all the hours they had to live 
 no use thinking of it and yet one cannot help thinking of 
 it even far away in the peaceful town the drummer and his wife 
 also thought of it for peter was at the war 
 
 now tired of these complaints said the 
 again the day of battle dawned the sun had not yet risen but 
 it was morning the drummer and his wife were asleep they had been talking about their son as indeed they did almost every night 
 for he was out yonder in hand and the father dreamt that the 
 war was over that the soldiers had returned home and that peter wore a silver cross on his breast but the mother dreamt that she had 
 gone into the church and had seen the painted pictures and the carved angels with the gilded hair and her own dear boy the golden treasure of her heart who was standing among the angels in white robes singing so sweetly as surely only the angels can sing and that he had soared up with them into the sunshine and nodded so kindly at his mother 
 
 my golden treasure she cried out and she awoke now the 
 good god has taken him to himself she folded her hands and hid 
 her face in the cotton curtains of the bed and wept where does he 
 rest now among the many in the big grave that they have dug for the 
 dead perhaps in the water in the marsh nobody knows his 
 grave no holy words have been read over it and the prayer 
 went inaudibly over her lips she bowed her head and was so weary 
 that she went to sleep 
 and the days went by in life as in dreams 
 
 it was evening over the a rainbow spread which 
 touched the forest and the deep marsh 
 
 it has been said and is preserved in popular belief that where 
 the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried a golden 
 treasure and here there was one no one but his mother thought of the little drummer and therefore she dreamt of him 
 and the days went by in life as in dreams 
 not a hair of his head had been hurt not a golden hair 
 there he is the drum might have said and his mother might have sung if she had seen or dreamt it 
 with hurrah and song adorned with green wreaths of victory 
 they came home as the war was at an end and peace had been signed 
 
 the dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large bounds and made the way three times as long for himself as it really was 
 
 and days and weeks went by and peter came into his parents room 
 he was as brown as a wild man and his eyes were bright and his 
 face beamed like sunshine and his mother held him in her arms she 
 kissed his lips his forehead and his red hair she had her boy 
 back again he had not a silver cross on his breast as his father had 
 dreamt but he had sound limbs a thing the mother had not dreamt 
 and what a rejoicing was there they laughed and they wept and peter embraced the old 
 
 there stands the old skeleton still he said 
 and the father beat a roll upon it 
 
 one would think that a great fire had broken out here said 
 the bright day fire in the heart golden treasure skrat 
 
 and what then what then ask the town musician 
 far outgrowing the drum he said peter will be greater 
 than i 
 
 and yet he was the son of a royal but all that he 
 had learned in half a lifetime peter learned in half a year 
 
 there was something so merry about him something so truly 
 his eyes gleamed and his hair gleamed too there was no denying that 
 
 he ought to have his hair dyed said the wife 
 
 that answered capitally with the daughter and she got 
 a husband 
 
 but her hair turned as green as duckweed and was always having 
 to be colored up 
 
 she knows how to manage for herself said the neighbors and so 
 can peter he comes to the most genteel houses even to the 
 where he gives miss charlotte lessons 
 he could play he could play fresh out of his heart the most 
 charming pieces that had never been put upon he played in the bright nights and in the dark nights too the neighbors 
 declared it was unbearable and the was of the same opinion 
 
 he played until his thoughts soared up and burst forth in great 
 plans for the future 
 
 to be famous 
 
 and charlotte sat at the piano her delicate fingers 
 danced over the keys and made them ring into heart it seemed too much for him to bear and this happened not once but many times and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the 
 white hand and kissed it and looked into her great brown eyes 
 heaven knows what he said but we may be allowed to guess at it 
 charlotte blushed to guess at it she reddened from brow to neck 
 and answered not a single word and then strangers came into the room and one of them was the state son he had a lofty white forehead and carried it so high that it seemed to go back into his neck and peter sat by her a long time and she looked at him with 
 gentle eyes 
 
 at home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world and 
 of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his violin 
 
 to be famous 
 
 said the peter 
 has gone clear out of his wits i think there must be a fire in the 
 house 
 
 next day the mother went to market 
 
 shall i tell you news peter she asked when she came home a 
 capital piece of news charlotte has engaged herself 
 to the state son the betrothal took place yesterday 
 evening 
 
 no cried peter and he sprang up from his chair but his mother 
 persisted in saying yes she had heard it from the wife 
 whose husband had it from the own mouth 
 and peter became as pale as death and sat down again 
 
 good heaven the matter with you asked his mother 
 
 nothing nothing only leave me to myself he answered but the 
 tears were running down his cheeks 
 
 my sweet child my golden treasure cried the mother and she 
 wept but the sang not out loud but inwardly 
 
 gone gone and now the song is done 
 but the song was not done there were many more verses in it long 
 verses the most beautiful verses the golden treasures of a life 
 she behaves like a mad woman said the wife all the 
 world is to see the letters she gets from her golden treasure and 
 to read the words that are written in the papers about his violin 
 playing and he sends her money too and very useful to her 
 since she has been a widow 
 
 he plays before emperors and kings said the town musician i 
 never had that fortune but my pupil and he does not forget 
 his old master 
 
 and his mother said 
 
 his father dreamt that peter came home from the war with a silver 
 cross he did not gain one in the war but it is still more 
 difficult to gain one in this way now he has the cross of honor if 
 his father had only lived to see it 
 
 grown famous said the and all his native town 
 said the same thing for the son peter with the red hair 
 peter whom they had known as a little boy running about in wooden 
 shoes and then as a drummer playing for the dancers was become 
 famous 
 
 he played at our house before he played in the presence of 
 kings said the wife at that time he was quite 
 smitten with charlotte he was always of an aspiring turn at that 
 time he was saucy and an enthusiast my husband laughed when he 
 heard of the foolish affair and now our charlotte is a state 
 wife 
 
 a golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of the 
 poor child who had beaten the roll as a drummer a roll of victory 
 for those who had been ready to retreat there was a golden treasure 
 in his bosom the power of sound it burst forth on his violin as if 
 the instrument had been a complete organ and as if all the elves of a 
 midsummer night were dancing across the strings in its sounds were 
 heard the piping of the thrush and the full clear note of the human 
 voice therefore the sound brought rapture to every heart and carried 
 his name triumphant through the land that was a great firebrand 
 the firebrand of inspiration 
 
 and then he looks so splendid said the young ladies and the old 
 ladies too and the oldest of all procured an album for famous locks 
 of hair wholly and solely that she might beg a lock of his rich 
 splendid hair that treasure that golden treasure 
 
 and the son came into the poor room of the drummer elegant as a 
 prince happier than a king his eyes were as clear and his face was 
 as radiant as sunshine and he held his mother in his arms and she 
 kissed his mouth and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for 
 joy and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room at the 
 cupboard with the and at the he nodded at the 
 where he had slept as a little boy but the old 
 he brought out and dragged it into the middle of the 
 room and said to it and to his mother 
 
 my father would have beaten a famous roll this evening now i 
 must do it 
 
 and he beat a thundering on the instrument and the drum 
 felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with exultation 
 
 he has a splendid touch said the drum a remembrance of 
 him now that will last i expect that the same thing will happen to 
 his mother from pure joy over her golden treasure 
 and this is the story of the golden treasure 
 
 the end

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter iii 
 
 in the same way he beheld as though they had passed before him in visible forms the two ideas which had up to that time formed the double rule of his concealment of his name the sanctification of his life 
 for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separated them 
 he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was necessarily good while the other might become bad that the first was and that the other was personality that the one said my neighbor and that the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other from darkness 
 they were antagonistic 
 he saw them in conflict 
 in proportion as he meditated they grew before the eyes of his spirit they had now attained colossal statures and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the midst of the darkness and the lights a goddess and a giant contending 
 he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand 
 he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that champmathieu marked the second after the grand crisis the grand test 
 but the fever allayed for an instant gradually resumed possession of him 
 a thousand thoughts traversed his mind but they continued to fortify him in his resolution 
 one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter too keenly that after all this champmathieu was not interesting and that he had actually been guilty of theft 
 he answered himself 
 if this man has indeed stolen a few apples that means a month in prison 
 it is a long way from that to the galleys and who knows 
 did he steal 
 has it been proved 
 the name of jean valjean overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proofs do not the attorneys for the crown always proceed in this manner he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict 
 in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he denounced himself the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he had done for the district and that they would have mercy on him 
 but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life 
 he turned aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere he told himself that he must do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it that if he allowed things to take their own course if he remained at m sur m his consideration his good name his good works the deference and veneration paid to him his charity his wealth his popularity his virtue would be seasoned with a crime and what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing while if he accomplished his sacrifice a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys the post the iron necklet the green cap unceasing toil and pitiless shame 
 at length he told himself that it must be so that his destiny was thus allotted that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high that in any case he must make his choice 
 virtue without and abomination within or holiness within and infamy without 
 the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail but his brain grow weary 
 he began to think of other things of indifferent matters in spite of himself 
 the veins in his temples throbbed violently he still paced to and fro midnight sounded first from the parish church then from the he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks and compared the sounds of the two bells he recalled in this connection the fact that a few days previously he had seen in an shop an ancient clock for sale upon which was written the name de romainville 
 he was cold he lighted a small fire it did not occur to him to close the window 
 in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this 
 ah yes he said to himself i had resolved to inform against myself 
 and then all of a sudden he thought of fantine 
 hold said he and what about that poor woman 
 here a fresh crisis declared itself 
 fantine by appearing thus abruptly in his revery produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect 
 he exclaimed 
 ah but i have hitherto considered no one but myself it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself to conceal my person or to save my soul to be a despicable and respected magistrate or an infamous and venerable convict it is i it is always i and nothing but i but good god all this is egotism these are diverse forms of egotism but it is egotism all the same what if i were to think a little about others 
 the highest holiness is to think of others come let us examine the matter the i excepted the i effaced the i forgotten what would be the result of all this 
 what if i denounce myself 
 i am arrested this champmathieu is released i am put back in the galleys that is well and what then 
 what is going on here 
 ah here is a country a town here are factories an industry workers both men and women aged grandsires children poor people 
 all this i have created all these i provide with their living everywhere where there is a smoking chimney it is i who have placed the brand on the hearth and meat in the pot i have created ease circulation credit before me there was nothing i have elevated vivified informed with life fecundated stimulated enriched the whole lacking me the soul is lacking i take myself off everything dies and this woman who has suffered so much who possesses so many merits in spite of her fall the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been 
 and that child whom i meant to go in search of whom i have promised to her mother do i not also owe something to this woman in reparation for the evil which i have done her if i disappear what happens 
 the mother dies the child becomes what it can that is what will take place if i denounce myself if i do not denounce myself come let us see how it will be if i do not denounce myself 
 after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and he answered himself calmly 
 well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce he has stolen 
 there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft for he has 
 i remain here i go on in ten years i shall have made ten millions i scatter them over the country i have nothing of my own what is that to me it is not for myself that i am doing it the prosperity of all goes on augmenting industries are aroused and animated factories and shops are multiplied families a hundred families a thousand families are happy the district becomes populated villages spring up where there were only farms before farms rise where there was nothing wretchedness disappears and with wretchedness debauchery prostitution theft murder all vices disappear all crimes 
 and this poor mother rears her child and behold a whole country rich and honest 
 ah 
 i was a fool i was absurd what was that i was saying about denouncing myself i really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything what because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous this is melodrama after all because i should have thought of no one but myself the idea for the sake of saving from a punishment a trifle exaggerated perhaps but just at bottom no one knows whom a thief a evidently a whole must perish a poor woman must die in the hospital a poor little girl must die in the street like dogs ah this is abominable and without the mother even having seen her child once more almost without the having known her mother and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an who most assuredly has deserved the galleys for something else if not for that fine scruples indeed which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel and which sacrifice a whole population mothers wives children this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me and who is no doubt blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers those peoples are rascals and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures and i was going off to denounce myself and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly let us put it at the worst 
 suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this and that my conscience will reproach me for it some day to accept for the good of others these reproaches which weigh only on myself this evil action which compromises my soul alone in that lies in that alone there is virtue 
 he rose and resumed his march this time he seemed to be content 
 diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth truths are found only in the depths of thought 
 it seemed to him that after having descended into these depths after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows he had at last found one of these diamonds one of these truths and that he now held it in his hand and he was dazzled as he gazed upon it 
 yes he thought this is right i am on the right road i have the solution i must end by holding fast to something my resolve is taken let things take their course let us no longer vacillate let us no longer hang back this is for the interest of all not for my own i am madeleine and madeleine i remain 
 woe to the man who is jean valjean 
 i am no longer he i do not know that man i no longer know anything it turns out that some one is jean valjean at the present moment let him look out for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on a head so much the worse for that head 
 he looked into the little mirror which hung above his and said 
 hold it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man now 
 he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short 
 come he said i must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear witness against me it is settled all these things must disappear 
 he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a small key he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the a secret receptacle opened a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the in this there were some rags a blue linen blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends 
 those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through d in october could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit 
 he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in order to remind himself continually of his but he had concealed all that came from the galleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen 
 he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all rags cudgel knapsack into the fire 
 he closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it 
 after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow 
 everything was on fire the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber 
 as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous rags which it contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes by bending over one could have readily recognized a doubt the piece stolen from the little savoyard 
 he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same step 
 all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the through the glow 
 hold he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them they must be destroyed also 
 he seized the two candlesticks 
 there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal 
 he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment 
 he felt a sense of real comfort 
 how good warmth is said he 
 he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks 
 a minute more and they were both in the fire 
 at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting 
 jean valjean 
 jean valjean 
 his hair rose upright 
 he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing 
 yes it finish said the voice 
 complete what you are about 
 destroy these candlesticks 
 annihilate this souvenir forget the bishop 
 forget everything 
 destroy this champmathieu do that is right 
 applaud yourself 
 so it is settled resolved fixed agreed 
 here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man whose whole misfortune lies in your name upon whom your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abjectness and horror 
 that is good be an honest man yourself remain monsieur le maire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent rear the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will bear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys 
 yes it is well arranged thus 
 ah wretch 
 the perspiration streamed from his brow 
 he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks 
 but that within him which had spoken had not finished 
 the voice continued 
 jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark 
 well listen infamous man 
 all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven and only the malediction will ascend to god 
 this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience had gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very ear 
 it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside of him 
 he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror 
 is there any one here he demanded aloud in utter bewilderment 
 then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot 
 how stupid i am 
 there can be no one 
 there was some one but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see 
 he placed the candlesticks on the 
 then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and awoke him with a start 
 this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of place 
 after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position 
 he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn 
 the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal 
 what a fatality 
 what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his position 
 there was a moment when he reflected on the future 
 denounce himself great god 
 deliver himself up 
 with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up once more 
 he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty 
 he should never more stroll in the fields he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of may he should never more bestow alms on the little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber 
 everything seemed charming to him at that moment 
 never again should he read those books never more should he write on that little table of white wood his old portress the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning 
 great god instead of that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well 
 at his age after having been what he was if he were only young again but to be addressed in his old age as thou by any one who pleased to be searched by the to receive the cudgellings to wear shoes on his bare feet to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang to submit to the curiosity of strangers who would be told 
 that man yonder is the famous jean valjean who was mayor of m sur m and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with lassitude their green caps drawn over their eyes to remount two by two the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the whip oh what misery 
 can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent being and become as monstrous as the human heart 
 and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery 
 should he remain in paradise and become a demon 
 should he return to hell and become an angel 
 what was to be done 
 great god what was to be done 
 the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him 
 his ideas began to grow confused once more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair 
 the name of romainville recurred incessantly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past 
 he thought that romainville was a little grove near paris where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april 
 he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly 
 he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone 
 at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind 
 he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue 
 ought he to denounce himself 
 ought he to hold his peace 
 he could not manage to see anything distinctly 
 the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished one after the other into smoke 
 he only felt that to whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness or the agony of his virtue 
 alas all his resolution had again taken possession of him he was no further advanced than at the beginning 
 thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand while the quivered in the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars

 book three 
 chapter x 
 
 at dawn on the sixteenth of november squadron in which nicholas rostov served and which was in prince detachment moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad rostov saw the cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration and dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before action which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood at nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in convoyed by a sontnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over and though not big had been a successful engagement the men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and adjutants as they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed 
 come here wostov dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food 
 the officers gathered round canteen eating and talking 
 there they are bringing another cried one of the officers indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two cossacks 
 one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had taken from the prisoner 
 sell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacks 
 if you like your honor 
 the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers addressing first one then another he said he would not have been taken it was not his fault but the who had sent him to seize some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there and at every word he added but hurt my little horse and stroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to us 
 the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it 
 but hurt my little horse said the alsatian to rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar 
 rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money 
 alley alley said the cossack touching the arm to make him go on 
 the emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars 
 all began to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyone was in his place waiting 
 rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the moment of meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he was ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more festive around him nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the voice 
 the pavlograd hussars he inquired 
 the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to that which had said the pavlograd hussars 
 the emperor drew level with rostov and halted face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested the liveliness of a boy and yet it was the face of the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the eyes met and rested on them for not more than two seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everything at any rate his eyes gazed for about two seconds into face a gentle mild light poured from them then all at once he raised his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot and galloped on 
 the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action 
 this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and were retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had passed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau itself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in the market place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head the wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity to the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his left foot began convulsively tapping the side with the spur and how the horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned 
 gently gently you do it more gently said the emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away 
 rostov saw tears filling the eyes and heard him as he was riding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what a terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre 
 the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight of the lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing the gratitude was announced to the vanguard rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major and rostov who had already drunk enough at the end of the feast proposed the health not our sovereign the emperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health of our sovereign that good enchanting and great man let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the french 
 if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as at schon grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we will all die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying it right i have drunk a good deal but that is how i feel and so do you too to the health of alexander the first hurrah 
 hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers 
 and the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the rostov 
 when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten filled others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire waving his uplifted arm 
 lads to our sovereign the emperor and victory over our enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old baritone 
 the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts 
 late that night when all had separated denisov with his short hand patted his favorite rostov on the shoulder 
 as no one to fall in love with on campaign fallen in love with the tsar he said 
 denisov make fun of it cried rostov it is such a lofty beautiful feeling such a 
 i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove 
 no you understand 
 and rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of what happiness it would be to die not in saving the life he did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyes he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian arms and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the russian arms

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the goloshes of fortune 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 a beginning 
 in a house in copenhagen not far from the new market a 
 very large party had assembled the host and his family expecting 
 no doubt to receive invitations in return one half of the company 
 were already seated at the the other half seemed to be 
 waiting the result of their question well how shall we 
 amuse ourselves 
 
 conversation followed which after a while began to prove very 
 entertaining among other subjects it turned upon the events of the 
 middle ages which some persons maintained were more full of 
 interest than our own times counsellor knapp defended this opinion so warmly that the lady of the house immediately went over to his side and both exclaimed against essays on ancient and modern times in which the preference is given to our own the counsellor considered the times of the danish king hans as the noblest and happiest 
 
 the conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment 
 by the arrival of a newspaper which did not however contain much 
 worth reading and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to 
 the in which cloaks sticks and goloshes were carefully 
 placed here sat two maidens one young and the other old as if they 
 had come and were waiting to accompany their mistresses home but on looking at them more closely it could easily be seen that they were 
 no common servants their shapes were too graceful their 
 complexions too delicate and the cut of their dresses much too 
 elegant they were two fairies the younger was not fortune herself 
 but the chambermaid of one of attendants who carries 
 about her more trifling gifts the elder one who was named care 
 looked rather gloomy she always goes about to perform her own 
 business in person for then she knows it is properly done they 
 were telling each other where they had been during the day the 
 messenger of fortune had only transacted a few unimportant matters 
 for instance she had preserved a new bonnet from a shower of rain 
 and obtained for an honest man a bow from a titled nobody and so 
 on but she had something extraordinary to relate after all 
 i must tell you said she that is my birthday and in 
 honor of it i have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes to 
 introduce amongst mankind these goloshes have the property of 
 making every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place he 
 wishes or that he exists at any period every wish is fulfilled at 
 the moment it is expressed so that for once mankind have the chance 
 of being happy 
 
 no replied care you may depend upon it that whoever puts on 
 those goloshes will be very unhappy and bless the moment in which 
 he can get rid of them 
 
 what are you thinking of replied the other now see i will 
 place them by the door some one will take them instead of his own 
 and he will be the happy man 
 
 this was the end of their conversation 
 
 counsellor 
 what happened to the counsellor 
 it was late when counsellor knapp lost in thought about the times 
 of king hans desired to return home and fate so ordered it that he 
 put on the goloshes of fortune instead of his own and walked out into the east street through the magic power of the goloshes he was at once carried back three hundred years to the times of king hans for which he had been longing when he put them on therefore he immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of the street which in those days possessed no pavement 
 
 why this is horrible how dreadfully dirty it is said the 
 counsellor and the whole pavement has vanished and the lamps are all out 
 
 the moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the thick 
 foggy air and all the objects around him were confused together in 
 the darkness at the nearest corner a lamp hung before a picture of 
 the madonna but the light it gave was almost useless for he only 
 perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted 
 figures of the mother and child 
 
 that is most likely a museum of art thought he and they 
 have forgotten to take down the sign 
 
 two men in the dress of olden times passed by him 
 
 what odd figures thought he they must be returning from 
 some masquerade 
 
 suddenly he heard the sound of a drum and fifes and then a 
 blazing light from torches shone upon him the counsellor stared 
 with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him first came a whole troop of drummers beating their drums very cleverly they were followed by with longbows and crossbows the principal person in the procession was a gentleman the astonished counsellor asked what it all meant and who the gentleman might be 
 
 that is the bishop of zealand 
 
 good gracious he exclaimed what in the world has happened 
 to the bishop what can he be thinking about then he shook his 
 head and said it cannot possibly be the bishop himself 
 
 while musing on this strange affair and without looking to the 
 right or left he walked on through east street and over highbridge 
 place the bridge which he supposed led to palace square was nowhere to be found but instead he saw a bank and some shallow water and two people who sat in a boat 
 
 does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the holm asked one 
 to the holm exclaimed the counsellor not knowing in what age 
 he was now existing i want to go to haven in little 
 turf street the men stared at him pray tell me where the bridge 
 is said he it is shameful that the lamps are not lighted here and 
 it is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh but the more he 
 talked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other 
 i understand your outlandish talk he cried at last 
 angrily turning his back upon them he could not however find the 
 bridge nor any railings 
 
 what a scandalous condition this place is in said he never 
 certainly had he found his own times so miserable as on this evening 
 i think it will be better for me to take a coach but where are 
 they there was not one to be seen i shall be obliged to go back to the new market said he where there are plenty of 
 carriages standing or i shall never reach haven then he 
 went towards east street and had nearly passed through it when the 
 moon burst forth from a cloud 
 
 dear me what have they been erecting here he cried as he 
 caught sight of the east gate which in olden times used to stand at 
 the end of east street however he found an opening through which 
 he passed and came out upon where he expected to find the new market 
 
 nothing was to be seen but an open meadow surrounded by a few bushes through which ran a broad canal or stream a few wooden booths for the accommodation of dutch watermen stood on the opposite shore 
 
 either i behold a fata morgana or i must be tipsy groaned 
 the counsellor what can it be what is the matter with me he 
 turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill in walking 
 through the street this time he examined the houses more closely 
 he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster and many 
 had only a thatched roof 
 
 i am certainly all wrong said he with a sigh and yet i only 
 drank one glass of punch but i cannot bear even that and it was very 
 foolish to give us punch and hot salmon i shall speak about it to our 
 hostess the lady suppose i were to go back now and say how ill i feel i fear it would look so ridiculous and it is not very 
 likely that i should find any one up then he looked for the house 
 but it was not in existence 
 
 this is really frightful i cannot even recognize east street 
 
 not a shop to be seen nothing but old wretched 
 houses just as if i were at roeskilde or ringstedt oh i really must 
 be ill it is no use to stand upon ceremony but where in the world is 
 the house there is a house but it is not his and people 
 still up in it i can hear oh dear i certainly am very queer as he 
 reached the door he saw a light and went in it was a 
 tavern of the olden times and seemed a kind of beershop the room had the appearance of a dutch interior a number of people consisting of seamen copenhagen citizens and a few scholars sat in deep conversation over their mugs and took very little notice of the new comer 
 
 pardon me said the counsellor addressing the landlady i do 
 not feel quite well and i should be much obliged if you will send for 
 a fly to take me to haven the woman stared at him and 
 shook her head then she spoke to him in german the counsellor 
 supposed from this that she did not understand danish he therefore 
 repeated his request in german this as well as his singular dress 
 convinced the woman that he was a foreigner she soon understood 
 however that he did not find himself quite well and therefore 
 brought him a mug of water it had something of the taste of seawater certainly although it had been drawn from the well outside 
 then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand drew a deep breath and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him 
 
 is that number of the day he asked quite mechanically as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper 
 
 she did not understand what he meant but she handed him the sheet it was a woodcut representing a meteor which had appeared in the town of cologne 
 
 that is very old said the counsellor becoming quite cheerful 
 at the sight of this antique drawing where did you get this singular 
 sheet it is very interesting although the whole affair is a fable 
 meteors are easily explained in these days they are northern 
 lights which are often seen and are no doubt caused by electricity 
 those who sat near him and heard what he said looked at him in 
 great astonishment and one of them rose took off his hat respectfully and said in a very serious manner you must certainly 
 be a very learned man monsieur 
 
 oh no replied the counsellor i can only discourse on topics 
 which every one should understand 
 
 modestia is a beautiful virtue said the man moreover i 
 must add to your speech mihi secus videtur yet in this case i would 
 suspend my judicium 
 
 may i ask to whom i have the pleasure of speaking 
 
 i am a bachelor of divinity said the man this answer satisfied 
 the counsellor the title agreed with the dress 
 
 this is surely thought he an old village schoolmaster a 
 perfect original such as one meets with sometimes even in jutland 
 
 this is not certainly a locus docendi began the man still i 
 must beg you to continue the conversation you must be well read in 
 ancient lore 
 
 oh yes replied the counsellor i am very fond of reading 
 useful old books and modern ones as well with the exception of 
 stories of which we really have more than enough 
 
 stories asked the bachelor 
 
 yes i mean the new novels that we have at the present day 
 
 oh replied the man with a smile and yet they are very witty 
 and are much read at court the king likes especially the romance of 
 messeurs iffven and gaudian which describes king arthur and his 
 knights of the round table he has joked about it with the gentlemen 
 of his court 
 
 well i have certainly not read that replied the counsellor i 
 suppose it is quite new and published by heiberg 
 
 no answered the man it is not by heiberg godfred von 
 gehman brought it out 
 
 oh is he the publisher that is a very old name said the 
 counsellor was it not the name of the first publisher in denmark 
 
 yes and he is our first printer and publisher now replied 
 the scholar 
 
 so far all had passed off very well but now one of the citizens 
 began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been raging a few 
 years before meaning the plague of the counsellor thought he 
 referred to the cholera and they could discuss this without finding 
 out the mistake the war in was spoken of as quite recent the 
 english pirates had taken some ships in the channel in and the 
 counsellor supposing they referred to these agreed with them in 
 finding fault with the english the rest of the talk however was not 
 so agreeable every moment one contradicted the other the good 
 bachelor appeared very ignorant for the simplest remark of the 
 counsellor seemed to him either too bold or too fantastic they stared 
 at each other and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in latin 
 in the hope of being better understood but it was all useless 
 how are you now asked the landlady pulling the 
 sleeve 
 
 then his recollection returned to him in the course of 
 conversation he had forgotten all that had happened previously 
 goodness me where am i said he it bewildered him as he 
 thought of it 
 
 we will have some claret or mead or bremen beer said one of 
 the guests will you drink with us 
 
 two maids came in one of them had a cap on her head of two 
 colors they poured out the wine bowed their heads and withdrew 
 the counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him what is this 
 what does it mean said he but he was obliged to drink with them 
 for they overpowered the good man with their politeness he became 
 at last desperate and when one of them said he was tipsy he did 
 not doubt the word in the least only begged them to get a 
 droschky and then they thought he was speaking the muscovite 
 language never before had he been in such rough and vulgar company 
 
 one might believe that the country was going back to heathenism 
 he observed this is the most terrible moment of my life 
 
 just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under the 
 table and so creep to the door he tried it but before he reached 
 the entry the rest discovered what he was about and seized him by 
 the feet when luckily for him off came the goloshes and with 
 them vanished the whole enchantment the counsellor now saw quite 
 plainly a lamp and a large building behind it everything looked 
 familiar and beautiful he was in east street as it now appears he 
 lay with his legs turned towards a porch and just by him sat the 
 watchman asleep 
 
 is it possible that i have been lying here in the street 
 dreaming said he yes this is east street how beautifully 
 bright and gay it looks it is quite shocking that one glass of 
 punch should have upset me like this 
 
 two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky which was to drive 
 him to haven he thought of all the terror and anxiety 
 which he had undergone and felt thankful from his heart for the 
 reality and comfort of modern times which with all their errors 
 were far better than those in which he so lately found himself 
 
 the adventures 
 well i declare there lies a pair of goloshes said the 
 watchman no doubt they belong to the lieutenant who lives up 
 stairs they are lying just by his door gladly would the honest 
 man have rung and given them in for a light was still burning but 
 he did not wish to disturb the other people in the house so he let 
 them lie these things must keep the feet very warm said he 
 they are of such nice soft leather then he tried them on and 
 they fitted his feet exactly now said he how droll things are in 
 this world that man can lie down in his warm bed but he does not do so there he goes pacing up and down the room he ought to be a happy man he has neither wife nor children and he goes out into company every evening oh i wish i were he then i should be a happy man 
 
 as he uttered this wish the goloshes which he had put on took 
 effect and the watchman at once became the lieutenant there he stood in his room holding a little piece of pink paper between his fingers on which was a poem a poem written by the lieutenant himself who has not had for once in his life a moment of poetic inspiration and at such a moment if the thoughts are written down they flow in poetry the following verses were written on the pink were i rich 
 oh were i rich how oft in bright hour 
 when youthful pleasures banish every care 
 i longed for riches but to gain a power 
 the sword and plume and uniform to wear 
 the riches and the honor came for me 
 yet still my greatest wealth was poverty 
 ah help and pity me 
 once in my youthful hours when gay and free 
 a maiden loved me and her gentle kiss 
 rich in its tender love and purity 
 taught me alas too much of earthly bliss 
 dear child she only thought of youthful glee 
 she loved no wealth but fairy tales and me 
 thou knowest ah pity me 
 oh were i rich again is all my prayer 
 that child is now a woman fair and free 
 as good and beautiful as angels are 
 oh were i rich in lovers poetry 
 to tell my fairy tale richest lore 
 but no i must be silent i am poor 
 ah wilt thou pity me 
 oh were i rich in truth and peace below 
 i need not then my poverty bewail 
 to thee i dedicate these lines of woe 
 wilt thou not understand the mournful tale 
 a leaf on which my sorrows i relate 
 dark story of a darker night of fate 
 ah bless and pity me 
 well yes people write poems when they are in love but a wise 
 man will not print them a lieutenant in love and poor this is a 
 triangle or more properly speaking the half of the broken die of 
 fortune the lieutenant felt this very keenly and therefore leaned 
 his head against the and sighed deeply the poor 
 watchman in the street said he is far happier than i am he 
 knows not what i call poverty he has a home a wife and children who weep at his sorrow and rejoice at his joy oh how much happier i should be could i change my being and position with him and pass 
 through life with his humble expectations and hopes yes he is indeed happier than i am 
 
 at this moment the watchman again became a watchman for having 
 through the goloshes of fortune passed into the existence of the 
 lieutenant and found himself less contented than he expected he 
 had preferred his former condition and wished himself again a 
 watchman that was an ugly dream said he but droll enough it 
 seemed to me as if i were the lieutenant up yonder but there was no 
 happiness for me i missed my wife and the little ones who are always ready to smother me with kisses he sat down again and nodded but he could not get the dream out of his thoughts and he still had the goloshes on his feet a falling star gleamed across the sky there goes one cried he however there are quite enough left i should very much like to examine these a little nearer especially the moon for that could not slip away under hands the student for whom my wife washes says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another if that were true it would be very delightful but i believe it i wish i could make a little spring up there now 
 i would willingly let my body lie here on the steps 
 
 there are certain things in the world which should be uttered very 
 cautiously doubly so when the speaker has on his feet the goloshes of fortune now we shall hear what happened to the watchman 
 nearly every one is acquainted with the great power of steam we 
 have proved it by the rapidity with which we can travel both on a 
 railroad or in a steamship across the sea but this speed is like 
 the movements of the sloth or the crawling march of the snail when 
 compared to the swiftness with which light travels light flies 
 nineteen million times faster than the fleetest and 
 electricity is more rapid still death is an electric shock which we 
 receive in our hearts and on the wings of electricity the liberated 
 soul flies away swiftly the light from the sun travels to our earth 
 millions of miles in eight minutes and a few seconds 
 but on the wings of electricity the mind requires only a second to 
 accomplish the same distance the space between the heavenly bodies is to thought no farther than the distance which we may have to walk from one house to another in the same town yet this electric shock obliges us to use our bodies here below unless like the watchman we have on the goloshes of fortune 
 
 in a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than two 
 hundred thousand miles to the moon which is formed of a lighter 
 material than our earth and may be said to be as soft as new fallen 
 snow he found himself on one of the circular range of mountains which we see represented in dr large map of the moon the interior had the appearance of a large hollow with a depth about half a mile from the brim within this hollow stood a large town we may form some idea of its appearance by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water the materials of which it was built seemed just as soft and pictured forth cloudy turrets and terraces quite transparent and floating in the thin air our earth 
 hung over his head like a great dark red ball presently he discovered 
 a number of beings which might certainly be called men but were very different to ourselves a more fantastical imagination than must have discovered these had they been placed in groups and painted it might have been said what beautiful foliage they had also a language of their own no one could have expected the soul of the watchman to understand it and yet he did understand it for our souls have much greater capabilities then we are inclined to believe do we not in our dreams show a wonderful dramatic talent each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his own character and with his own voice no man could thus imitate them in his waking hours how clearly too we are reminded of persons whom we have not seen for many years they start up suddenly to the eye with all their peculiarities as living realities in fact this memory of the soul is a fearful thing every sin every sinful thought it can bring back and we may well ask how we are to give account of every idle word that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips the spirit of the watchman therefore understood very well the language of the inhabitants of the moon 
 they were disputing about our earth and doubted whether it could be inhabited the atmosphere they asserted must be too dense for any inhabitants of the moon to exist there they maintained that the moon alone was inhabited and was really the heavenly body in which the old world people lived they likewise talked politics 
 
 but now we will descend to east street and see what happened to 
 the body he sat lifeless on the steps his staff had 
 fallen out of his hand and his eyes stared at the moon about which 
 his honest soul was wandering 
 
 what is it watchman inquired a passenger but there 
 was no answer from the watchman 
 
 the man then pulled his nose gently which caused him to lose 
 his balance the body fell forward and lay at full length on the 
 ground as one dead 
 
 all his comrades were very much frightened for he seemed quite 
 dead still they allowed him to remain after they had given notice 
 of what had happened and at dawn the body was carried to the 
 hospital we might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the soul of 
 the man should chance to return to him for most probably it would 
 seek for the body in east street without being able to find it we 
 might fancy the soul inquiring of the police or at the address 
 office or among the missing parcels and then at length finding it at 
 the hospital but we may comfort ourselves by the certainty that the 
 soul when acting upon its own impulses is wiser than we are it is 
 the body that makes it stupid 
 
 as we have said the body had been taken to the 
 hospital and here it was placed in a room to be washed naturally 
 the first thing done here was to take off the goloshes upon which the 
 soul was instantly obliged to return and it took the direct road to 
 the body at once and in a few seconds the life returned to him 
 he declared when he quite recovered himself that this had been the 
 most dreadful night he had ever passed not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again however it was all over now 
 
 the same day he was allowed to leave but the goloshes remained at 
 the hospital 
 
 the eventful moment a most unusual journey 
 every inhabitant of copenhagen knows what the entrance to 
 hospital is like but as most probably a few of those 
 who read this little tale may not reside in copenhagen we will give a 
 short description of it 
 
 the hospital is separated from the street by an iron railing in 
 which the bars stand so wide apart that it is said some very slim 
 patients have squeezed through and gone to pay little visits in the 
 town the most difficult part of the body to get through was the head and in this case as it often happens in the world the small heads were the most fortunate this will serve as sufficient introduction to our tale one of the young volunteers of whom physically speaking it might be said that he had a great head was on guard that evening at the hospital the rain was pouring down yet in spite of these two obstacles he wanted to go out just for a quarter of an hour it was not worth while he thought to make a confidant of the porter as he could easily slip through the iron railings there lay the goloshes which the watchman had forgotten it never occurred to him that these could be goloshes of fortune they would be very 
 serviceable to him in this rainy weather so he drew them on now came the question whether he could squeeze through the palings he 
 certainly had never tried so he stood looking at them i wish to 
 goodness my head was through said he and instantly though it was 
 so thick and large it slipped through quite easily the goloshes 
 answered that purpose very well but his body had to follow and 
 this was impossible i am too fat he said i thought my head would be the worst but i cannot get my body through that is certain then he tried to pull his head back again but without success he could move his neck about easily enough and that was all his first feeling was one of anger and then his spirits sank below zero the goloshes of fortune had placed him in this terrible position and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free no instead of wishing he kept twisting about yet did not stir from the spot the rain poured and not a creature could be seen in the street 
 the bell he was unable to reach and however was he to get loose 
 
 he foresaw that he should have to stay there till morning and then 
 they must send for a smith to file away the iron bars and that 
 would be a work of time all the charity children would just be 
 going to school and all the sailors who inhabited that quarter of the 
 town would be there to see him standing in the pillory what a crowd 
 there would be ha he cried the blood is rushing to my head 
 and i shall go mad i believe i am crazy already oh i wish i were 
 free then all these sensations would pass off this is just what 
 he ought to have said at first the moment he had expressed the 
 thought his head was free he started back quite bewildered with 
 the fright which the goloshes of fortune had caused him but we must not suppose it was all over no indeed there was worse to come yet the night passed and the whole of the following day but no one sent for the goloshes in the evening a declamatory performance was to take place at the amateur theatre in a distant street the house was crowded among the audience was the young volunteer from the hospital who seemed to have quite forgotten his adventures of the previous evening he had on the goloshes they had not been sent for and as the streets were still very dirty they were of great service to him a new poem entitled my spectacles was being recited it described these spectacles as possessing a wonderful power if any one put them on in a large assembly the people appeared like cards and the future events of ensuing years could be easily foretold by them the idea struck him that he should very much like to have such a pair of spectacles for if used rightly 
 they would perhaps enable him to see into the hearts of people 
 which he thought would be more interesting than to know what was going to happen next year for future events would be sure to show 
 themselves but the hearts of people never i can fancy what i should 
 see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the first seat if i 
 could only look into their hearts that lady i imagine keeps a store 
 for things of all descriptions how my eyes would wander about in that collection with many ladies i should no doubt find a large 
 millinery establishment there is another that is perhaps empty and 
 would be all the better for cleaning out there may be some well 
 stored with good articles ah yes he sighed i know one in 
 which everything is solid but a servant is there already and that is 
 the only thing against it i dare say from many i should hear the 
 words please to walk in i only wish i could slip into the hearts 
 like a little tiny thought this was the word of command for the 
 goloshes the volunteer shrunk up together and commenced a most 
 unusual journey through the hearts of the spectators in the first row 
 
 the first heart he entered was that of a lady but he thought he 
 must have got into one of the rooms of an orthopedic institution where plaster casts of deformed limbs were hanging on the walls with this difference that the casts in the institution are formed when the 
 patient enters but here they were formed and preserved after the good people had left these were casts of the bodily and mental deformities of the female friends carefully preserved quickly he passed into another heart which had the appearance of a spacious holy church with the white dove of innocence fluttering over the altar 
 gladly would he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred place but 
 he was carried on to another heart still however listening to the 
 tones of the organ and feeling himself that he had become another and a better man the next heart was also a sanctuary which he felt 
 almost unworthy to enter it represented a mean garret in which lay a 
 sick mother but the warm sunshine streamed through the window lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof two blue birds sang of childlike joys and the sick mother prayed for a blessing on her daughter next he crept on his hands and knees through an overfilled shop there was meat nothing but meat wherever he stepped this was the heart of a rich respectable man whose name is doubtless in the directory then he entered the heart of this wife it was an old the portrait served as a it was connected with all the doors which opened and shut just as the decision turned the next heart was a complete cabinet of mirrors such as can be seen in the castle of rosenberg but these mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree in the middle of the floor sat like the grand lama the insignificant 
 i of the owner astonished at the contemplation of his own features 
 at his next visit he fancied he must have got into a narrow 
 needlecase full of sharp needles oh thought he this must be the 
 heart of an old maid but such was not the fact it belonged to a 
 young officer who wore several orders and was said to be a man of 
 intellect and heart 
 
 the poor volunteer came out of the last heart in the row quite 
 bewildered he could not collect his thoughts and imagined his 
 foolish fancies had carried him away good gracious he sighed i 
 must have a tendency to softening of the brain and here it is so 
 exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head and then 
 suddenly recurred to him the strange event of the evening before when his head had been fixed between the iron railings in front of the 
 hospital that is the cause of it all he exclaimed i must do 
 something in time a russian bath would be a very good thing to 
 begin with i wish i were lying on one of the highest shelves sure 
 enough there he lay on an upper shelf of a vapor bath still in his 
 evening costume with his boots and goloshes on and the hot drops 
 from the ceiling falling on his face ho he cried jumping down and 
 rushing towards the plunging bath the attendant stopped him with a 
 loud cry when he saw a man with all his clothes on the volunteer 
 had however presence of mind enough to whisper it is for a wager but the first thing he did when he reached his own room was to put a large blister on his neck and another on his back that his crazy fit might be cured the next morning his back was very sore which was all he gained by the goloshes of fortune 
 
 the transformation 
 the watchman whom we of course have not forgotten thought after 
 a while of the goloshes which he had found and taken to the hospital 
 so he went and fetched them but neither the lieutenant nor any one in 
 the street could recognize them as their own so he gave them up to 
 the police they look exactly like my own goloshes said one of 
 the clerks examining the unknown articles as they stood by the 
 side of his own it would require even more than the eye of a 
 shoemaker to know one pair from the other 
 
 master clerk said a servant who entered with some papers the 
 clerk turned and spoke to the man but when he had done with him he turned to look at the goloshes again and now he was in greater 
 doubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or on the left 
 belonged to him those that are wet must be mine thought he but he thought wrong it was just the reverse the goloshes of fortune were the wet pair and besides why should not a clerk in a police 
 office be wrong sometimes so he drew them on thrust his papers 
 into his pocket placed a few manuscripts under his arm which he 
 had to take with him and to make abstracts from at home then as 
 it was sunday morning and the weather very fine he said to himself 
 a walk to fredericksburg will do me good so away he went 
 
 there could not be a quieter or more steady young man than this 
 clerk we will not grudge him this little walk it was just the 
 thing to do him good after sitting so much he went on at first like a 
 mere automaton without thought or wish therefore the goloshes had no opportunity to display their magic power in the avenue he met with an acquaintance one of our young poets who told him that he intended to start on the following day on a summer excursion are you really going away so soon asked the clerk what a free happy man you can roam about where you will while such as we are tied by the foot 
 
 but it is fastened to the replied the poet you 
 need have no anxiety for the morrow and when you are old there is a 
 pension for you 
 
 ah yes but you have the best of it said the clerk it must 
 be so delightful to sit and write poetry the whole world makes itself 
 agreeable to you and then you are your own master you should try how you would like to listen to all the trivial things in a court of 
 justice the poet shook his head so also did the clerk each 
 retained his own opinion and so they parted they are strange 
 people these poets thought the clerk i should like to try what it 
 is to have a poetic taste and to become a poet myself i am sure i 
 should not write such mournful verses as they do this is a splendid 
 spring day for a poet the air is so remarkably clear the clouds 
 are so beautiful and the green grass has such a sweet smell for many years i have not felt as i do at this moment 
 
 we perceive by these remarks that he had already become a 
 poet by most poets what he had said would be considered or as the germans call it insipid it is a foolish fancy to look 
 upon poets as different to other men there are many who are more 
 the poets of nature than those who are professed poets the difference is this the intellectual memory is better he seizes upon an idea or a sentiment until he can embody it clearly and plainly in words which the others cannot do but the transition from a character of life to one of a more gifted nature is a great 
 transition and so the clerk became aware of the change after a 
 time what a delightful perfume said he it reminds me of the 
 violets at aunt ah that was when i was a little boy dear me 
 how long it seems since i thought of those days she was a good old 
 maiden lady she lived yonder behind the exchange she always had a sprig or a few blossoms in water let the winter be ever so severe 
 i could smell the violets even while i was placing warm penny 
 pieces against the frozen panes to make and a pretty 
 view it was on which i peeped out in the river lay the ships 
 icebound and forsaken by their crews a screaming crow represented 
 the only living creature on board but when the breezes of spring 
 came everything started into life amidst shouting and cheers the 
 ships were tarred and rigged and then they sailed to foreign lands 
 i remain here and always shall remain sitting at my post at the 
 police office and letting others take passports to distant lands 
 yes this is my fate and he sighed deeply suddenly he paused good gracious what has come over me i never felt before as i do now it must be the air of spring it is overpowering and yet it is 
 delightful 
 
 he felt in his pockets for some of his papers these will give me 
 something else to think of said he casting his eyes on the first 
 page of one he read mistress sigbirth an original tragedy in 
 five acts what is this in my own handwriting too have i 
 written this tragedy he read again the intrigue on the promenade 
 or the a vaudeville however did i get all this some 
 one must have put them into my pocket and here is a letter it was 
 from the manager of a theatre the pieces were rejected not at all in 
 polite terms 
 
 hem hem said he sitting down on a bench his thoughts were 
 very elastic and his heart softened strangely involuntarily he 
 seized one of the nearest flowers it was a little simple daisy 
 all that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in a 
 moment by this little flower it spoke of the glory of its birth it 
 told of the strength of the sunlight which had caused its delicate 
 leaves to expand and given to it such sweet perfume the struggles of life which arouse sensations in the bosom have their type in the 
 tiny flowers air and light are the lovers of the flowers but light 
 is the favored one towards light it turns and only when light 
 vanishes does it fold its leaves together and sleep in the embraces 
 of the air 
 
 it is light that adorns me said the flower 
 
 but the air gives you the breath of life whispered the poet 
 just by him stood a boy splashing with his stick in a marshy 
 ditch the spurted up among the green twigs and the clerk thought of the millions of animalculae which were thrown into the air with every drop of water at a height which must be the same to them as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the clouds as 
 the clerk thought of all these things and became conscious of the 
 great change in his own feelings he smiled and said to himself i 
 must be asleep and dreaming and yet if so how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream i hope i shall be able to remember it all when i wake 
 tomorrow my sensations seem most unaccountable i have a clear 
 perception of everything as if i were wide awake i am quite sure if i 
 recollect all this tomorrow it will appear utterly ridiculous and 
 absurd i have had this happen to me before it is with the clever 
 or wonderful things we say or hear in dreams as with the gold which 
 comes from under the earth it is rich and beautiful when we possess 
 it but when seen in a true light it is but as stones and withered 
 leaves 
 
 ah he sighed mournfully as he gazed at the birds singing 
 merrily or hopping from branch to branch they are much better off 
 than i flying is a glorious power happy is he who is born with 
 wings yes if i could change myself into anything i would be a little 
 lark at the same moment his and sleeves grew together and formed wings his clothes changed to feathers and his goloshes to claws he felt what was taking place and laughed to himself 
 well now it is evident i must be dreaming but i never had such a wild dream as this and then he flew up into the green boughs and sang but thre was no poetry in the song for his poetic nature had left 
 him the goloshes like all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly could only attend to one thing at a time he wished to be a poet and he became one then he wanted to be a little bird and in this change he lost the characteristics of the former one well 
 thought he this is charming by day i sit in a 
 amongst the dryest law papers and at night i can dream that i am a 
 lark flying about in the gardens of fredericksburg really a complete 
 comedy could be written about it then he flew down into the grass 
 turned his head about in every direction and tapped his beak on the 
 bending blades of grass which in proportion to his size seemed to 
 him as long as the in northern africa 
 
 in another moment all was darkness around him it seemed as if 
 something immense had been thrown over him a sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly that he squeaked and then cried out in his alarm you impudent rascal i am a clerk in the but it only sounded to the boy like tweet tweet so he tapped the bird on the beak and walked away with him in the 
 avenue he met two who appeared to belong to a better 
 class of society but whose inferior abilities kept them in the lowest 
 class at school these boys bought the bird for eightpence and so the clerk returned to copenhagen it is well for me that i am 
 dreaming he thought otherwise i should become really angry 
 first i was a poet and now i am a lark it must have been the 
 poetic nature that changed me into this little creature it is a 
 miserable story indeed especially now i have fallen into the hands of 
 boys i wonder what will be the end of it the boys carried him 
 into a very elegant room where a stout lady 
 received them but she was not at all gratified to find that they 
 had brought a lark a common as she called it however she allowed them for one day to place the bird in an empty cage that 
 hung near the window it will please polly perhaps she said 
 laughing at a large gray parrot who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage it is birthday she added 
 in a simpering tone and the little has come to offer 
 his congratulations 
 
 polly did not answer a single word he continued to swing 
 proudly to and fro but a beautiful canary who had been brought 
 from his own warm fragrant fatherland the summer previous began 
 to sing as loud as he could 
 
 you screamer said the lady throwing a white handkerchief 
 over the cage 
 
 tweet tweet sighed he what a dreadful snowstorm and then 
 he became silent 
 
 the clerk or as the lady called him the was placed in 
 a little cage close to the canary and not far from the parrot the 
 only human speech which polly could utter and which she sometimes 
 chattered forth most comically was now let us be men all besides 
 was a scream quite as unintelligible as the warbling of the 
 excepting to the clerk who being now a bird could 
 understand his comrades very well 
 
 i flew beneath green and amidst the blooming 
 sang the canary i flew with my brothers and sisters 
 over beautiful flowers and across the clear bright sea which 
 reflected the waving foliage in its glittering depths and i have seen 
 many gay parrots who could relate long and delightful stories 
 
 they were wild birds answered the parrot and totally 
 uneducated now let us be men why do you not laugh if the lady and her visitors can laugh at this surely you can it is a great 
 failing not to be able to appreciate what is amusing now let us be 
 men 
 
 do you remember said the canary the pretty maidens who used 
 to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms 
 
 do you remember the delicious fruit and the cooling juice from the 
 wild herbs 
 
 oh yes said the parrot but here i am much better off i am 
 well fed and treated politely i know that i have a clever head 
 and what more do i want let us be men now you have a soul for 
 poetry i have deep knowledge and wit you have genius but no 
 discretion you raise your naturally high notes so much that you 
 get covered over they never serve me so oh no i cost them 
 something more than you i keep them in order with my beak and 
 fling my wit about me now let us be men 
 
 o my warm blooming fatherland sang the canary bird i will 
 sing of thy trees and thy quiet streams where the 
 bending branches kiss the clear smooth water i will sing of the 
 joy of my brothers and sisters as their shining plumage flits among 
 the dark leaves of the plants which grow wild by the springs 
 
 do leave off those dismal strains said the parrot sing 
 something to make us laugh laughter is the sign of the highest 
 order of intellect can a dog or a horse laugh no they can cry 
 but to man alone is the power of laughter given ha ha ha 
 laughed polly and repeated his witty saying now let us be men 
 you little gray danish bird said the canary you also have 
 become a prisoner it is certainly cold in your forests but still 
 there is liberty there fly out they have forgotten to close the 
 cage and the window is open at the top fly fly 
 
 instinctively the clerk obeyed and left the cage at the same 
 moment the door leading into the next room creaked on 
 its hinges and stealthily with green fiery eyes the cat crept in 
 and chased the lark round the room the fluttered in his 
 cage and the parrot flapped his wings and cried let us be men the 
 poor clerk in the most deadly terror flew through the window over 
 the houses and through the streets till at length he was obliged 
 to seek a a house opposite to him had a look of home 
 a window stood open he flew in and perched upon the table it was 
 his own room let us be men now said he involuntarily imitating 
 the parrot and at the same moment he became a clerk again only 
 that he was sitting on the table heaven preserve us said he 
 how did i get up here and fall asleep in this way it was an uneasy 
 dream too that i had the whole affair appears most absurd 
 
 the best thing the goloshes did 
 early on the following morning while the clerk was still in 
 bed his neighbor a young divinity student who lodged on the same 
 storey knocked at his door and then walked in lend me your 
 goloshes said he it is so wet in the garden but the sun is 
 shining brightly i should like to go out there and smoke my pipe he 
 put on the goloshes and was soon in the garden which contained 
 only one and one yet in a town even a small 
 garden like this is a great advantage 
 
 the student wandered up and down the path it was just six 
 and he could hear the sound of the in the street 
 oh to travel to travel cried he there is no greater happiness 
 in the world it is the height of my ambition this restless feeling 
 would be stilled if i could take a journey far away from this 
 country i should like to see beautiful switzerland to travel through 
 italy and it was well for him that the goloshes acted immediately 
 otherwise he might have been carried too far for himself as well as 
 for us in a moment he found himself in switzerland closely packed 
 with eight others in the diligence his head ached his back was 
 stiff and the blood had ceased to circulate so that his feet were 
 swelled and pinched by his boots he wavered in a condition between 
 sleeping and waking in his pocket he had a letter of 
 credit in his pocket was his passport and a few louis 
 were sewn into a little leather bag which he carried in his 
 whenever he dozed he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions then he would awake with a start and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his 
 pocket to his breast and from his breast to his 
 pocket to feel whether they were all safe umbrellas 
 sticks and hats swung in the net before him and almost obstructed 
 the prospect which was really very imposing and as he glanced at it 
 his memory recalled the words of one poet at least who has sung of 
 switzerland and whose poems have not yet been printed 
 how lovely to my wondering eyes 
 mont fair summits gently rise 
 tis sweet to breathe the mountain air 
 if you have gold enough to spare 
 grand dark and gloomy appeared the landscape around him the 
 looked like little groups of moss on high rocks whose 
 summits were lost in clouds of mist presently it began to snow and 
 the wind blew keen and cold ah he sighed if i were only on the 
 other side of the alps now it would be summer and i should be able 
 to get money on my letter of credit the anxiety i feel on this matter 
 prevents me from enjoying myself in switzerland oh i wish i was on 
 the other side of the alps 
 
 and there in a moment he found himself far away in the midst of 
 italy between florence and rome where the lake thrasymene 
 glittered in the evening sunlight like a sheet of molten gold 
 between the dark blue mountains there where hannibal defeated 
 flaminius the grape vines clung to each other with the friendly grasp 
 of their green tendril fingers while by the wayside lovely 
 children were watching a herd of swine under the blossoms of fragrant laurel could we rightly describe this 
 picturesque scene our readers would exclaim delightful italy 
 but neither the student nor either of his travelling companions 
 felt the least inclination to think of it in this way poisonous flies 
 and gnats flew into the coach by thousands in vain they drove them 
 away with a myrtle branch the flies stung them notwithstanding there was not a man in the coach whose face was not swollen and disfigured with the stings the poor horses looked wretched the flies settled on their backs in swarms and they were only relieved when the coachmen got down and drove the creatures off 
 
 as the sun set an icy coldness filled all nature not however 
 of long duration it produced the feeling which we experience when 
 we enter a vault at a funeral on a day while the hills 
 and the clouds put on that singular green hue which we often notice in 
 old paintings and look upon as unnatural until we have ourselves seen 
 coloring in the south it was a glorious spectacle but the 
 stomachs of the travellers were empty their bodies exhausted with 
 fatigue and all the longings of their heart turned towards a 
 for the night but where to find one they knew not 
 all the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this to 
 notice the beauties of nature 
 
 the road passed through a grove of it reminded the 
 student of the at home here stood a lonely inn and 
 close by it a number of crippled beggars had placed themselves the 
 brightest among them looked to quote the words of marryat like 
 the eldest son of famine who had just come of age the others were 
 either blind or had withered legs which obliged them to creep 
 about on their hands and knees or they had shrivelled arms and 
 hands without fingers it was indeed poverty arrayed in rags 
 eccellenza miserabili they exclaimed stretching forth their 
 diseased limbs the hostess received the travellers with bare feet 
 untidy hair and a dirty blouse the doors were fastened together with 
 string the floors of the rooms were of brick broken in many 
 places bats flew about under the roof and as to the odor within 
 let us have supper laid in the stable said one of the 
 travellers then we shall know what we are breathing 
 the windows were opened to let in a little fresh air but 
 quicker than air came in the withered arms and the continual whining 
 sounds miserabili eccellenza on the walls were inscriptions 
 half of them against la bella italia 
 
 the supper made its appearance at last it consisted of watery 
 soup seasoned with pepper and rancid oil this last delicacy played a principal part in the salad musty eggs and roasted 
 were the best dishes on the table even the wine had a strange 
 taste it was certainly a mixture at night all the boxes were placed 
 against the doors and one of the travellers watched while the 
 others slept the turn came to watch how close the air felt 
 in that room the heat overpowered him the gnats were buzzing about and stinging while the miserabili outside moaned in their dreams 
 
 travelling would be all very well said the student of 
 divinity to himself if we had no bodies or if the body could rest 
 while the soul if flying wherever i go i feel a want which 
 oppresses my heart for something better presents itself at the 
 moment yes something better which shall be the best of all but 
 where is that to be found in fact i know in my heart very well 
 what i want i wish to attain the greatest of all happiness 
 
 no sooner were the words spoken than he was at home long white 
 curtains shaded the windows of his room and in the middle of the 
 floor stood a black coffin in which he now lay in the still sleep 
 of death his wish was fulfilled his body was at rest and his spirit 
 travelling 
 
 esteem no man happy until he is in his grave were the words 
 of solon here was a strong fresh proof of their truth every corpse 
 is a sphinx of immortality the sphinx in this sarcophagus might 
 unveil its own mystery in the words which the living had himself 
 written two days before 
 stern death thy chilling silence waketh dread 
 yet in thy darkest hour there may be light 
 garden reaper from the cold bed 
 the soul on ladder takes her flight 
 greatest sorrows often are a part 
 of hidden griefs concealed from human eyes 
 which press far heavier on the lonely heart 
 than now the earth that on his coffin lies 
 two figures were moving about the room we know them both one was the fairy named care the other the messenger of fortune they bent over the dead 
 
 look said care what happiness have your goloshes brought to 
 mankind 
 
 they have at least brought lasting happiness to him who 
 slumbers here she said 
 
 not so said care he went away of himself he was not 
 summoned his mental powers were not strong enough to discern the 
 treasures which he had been destined to discover i will do him a 
 favor now and she drew the goloshes from his feet 
 
 the sleep of death was ended and the recovered man raised 
 himself care vanished and with her the goloshes doubtless she 
 looked upon them as her own property 
 
 the end

democratic national convention address 
 jesse jackson 
 the rainbow coalition 
 delivered july san francisco 
 thank you very much 
 tonight we come together bound by our faith in a mighty god with genuine respect and love for our country and inheriting the legacy of a great party the democratic party which is the best hope for redirecting our nation on a more humane just and peaceful course 
 this is not a perfect party we are not a perfect people yet we are called to a perfect mission our mission to feed the hungry to clothe the naked to house the homeless to teach the illiterate to provide jobs for the jobless and to choose the human race over the nuclear race 
 we are gathered here this week to nominate a candidate and adopt a platform which will expand unify direct and inspire our party and the nation to fulfill this mission my constituency is the desperate the damned the disinherited the disrespected and the despised they are restless and seek relief they have voted in record numbers they have invested the faith hope and trust that they have in us the democratic party must send them a signal that we care i pledge my best not to let them down 
 there is the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity leadership must heed the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity for they are the key to achieving our mission time is neutral and does not change things with courage and initiative leaders change things 
 no generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born an age of enlightenment an age of jobs and peace and justice only leadership that intangible combination of gifts the discipline information circumstance courage timing will and divine inspiration can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation leadership can part the waters and lead our nation in the direction of the promised land leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom 
 i have had the rare opportunity to watch seven men and then two pour out their souls offer their service and heal and heed the call of duty to direct the course of our nation there is a proper season for everything there is a time to sow and a time to reap a time to compete and a time to cooperate 
 i ask for your vote on the first ballot as a vote for a new direction for this party and this nation a vote of conviction a vote of conscience but i will be proud to support the nominee of this convention for the presidency of the united states of america thank you 
 i have watched the leadership of our party develop and grow my respect for both mr mondale and mr hart is great i have watched them struggle with the crosswinds and crossfires of being public servants and i believe they will both continue to try to serve us faithfully 
 i am elated by the knowledge that for the first time in our history a woman geraldine ferraro will be recommended to share our ticket 
 throughout this campaign tried to offer leadership to the democratic party and the nation if in my high moments i have done some good offered some service shed some light healed some wounds rekindled some hope or stirred someone from apathy and indifference or in any way along the way helped somebody then this campaign has not been in vain 
 for friends who loved and cared for me and for a god who spared me and for a family who understood i am eternally grateful 
 if in my low moments in word deed or attitude through some error of temper taste or tone i have caused anyone discomfort created pain or revived fears that was not my truest self if there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance please forgive me charge it to my head and not to my heart my head so limited in its finitude my heart which is boundless in its love for the human family i am not a perfect servant i am a public servant doing my best against the odds as i develop and serve be patient god is not finished with me yet 
 this campaign has taught me much that leaders must be tough enough to fight tender enough to cry human enough to make mistakes humble enough to admit them strong enough to absorb the pain and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving 
 for leaders the pain is often intense but you must smile through your tears and keep moving with the faith that there is a brighter side somewhere 
 i went to see hubert humphrey three days before he died he had just called richard nixon from his dying bed and many people wondered why and i asked him he said jesse from this vantage point the sun is setting in my life all of the speeches the political conventions the crowds and the great fights are behind me now at a time like this you are forced to deal with your irreducible essence forced to grapple with that which is really important to you and what concluded about life hubert humphrey said when all is said and done we must forgive each other and redeem each other and move on 
 our party is emerging from one of its most hard fought battles for the democratic presidential nomination in our history but our healthy competition should make us better not bitter we must use the insight wisdom and experience of the late hubert humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our party this nation and the world we must forgive each other redeem each other regroup and move one our flag is red white and blue but our nation is a rainbow red yellow brown black and white and all precious in sight 
 america is not like a blanket one piece of unbroken cloth the same color the same texture the same size america is more like a quilt many patches many pieces many colors many sizes all woven and held together by a common thread the white the hispanic the black the arab the jew the woman the native american the small farmer the businessperson the environmentalist the peace activist the young the old the lesbian the gay and the disabled make up the american quilt 
 even in our fractured state all of us count and fit somewhere we have proven that we can survive without each other but we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other we must come together 
 from fannie lou hamer in atlantic city in to the rainbow coalition in san francisco today from the atlantic to the pacific we have experienced pain but progress as we ended american apartheid laws we got public accommodations we secured voting rights we obtained open housing as young people got the right to vote we lost malcolm martin medgar bobby john and viola the team that got us here must be expanded not abandoned 
 twenty years ago tears welled up in our eyes as the bodies of schwerner goodman and chaney were dredged from the depths of a river in mississippi twenty years later our communities black and jewish are in anguish anger and pain feelings have been hurt on both sides there is a crisis in communications confusion is in the air but we cannot afford to lose our way we may agree to agree or agree to disagree on issues we must bring back civility to these tensions 
 we are in a long and rich religious history the traditions many blacks and jews have a shared passion for social justice at home and peace abroad we must seek a revival of the spirit inspired by a new vision and new possibilities we must return to higher ground we are bound by moses and jesus but also connected with islam and mohammed these three great religions judaism christianity and islam were all born in the revered and holy city of jerusalem 
 we are bound by dr martin luther king jr and rabbi abraham heschel crying out from their graves for us to reach common ground we are bound by shared blood and shared sacrifices we are much too intelligent much too bound by our heritage much too victimized by racism sexism militarism and much too threatened as historical scapegoats to go on divided one from another we must turn from finger pointing to clasped hands we must share our burdens and our joys with each other once again we must turn to each other and not on each other and choose higher ground 
 twenty years later we cannot be satisfied by just restoring the old coalition old wine skins must make room for new wine we must heal and expand the rainbow coalition is making room for arab americans they too know the pain and hurt of racial and religious rejection they must not continue to be made pariahs the rainbow coalition is making room for hispanic americans who this very night are living under the threat of the bill and farm workers from ohio who are fighting the campbell soup company with a boycott to achieve legitimate workers rights 
 the rainbow is making room for the native american the most exploited people of all a people with the greatest moral claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of their ancient land and claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of land and water rights as they seek to preserve their ancestral homeland and the beauty of a land that was once all theirs they can never receive a fair share for all they have given us they must finally have a fair chance to develop their great resources and to preserve their people and their culture 
 the rainbow coalition includes asian americans now being killed in our streets scapegoats for the failures of corporate industrial and economic policies 
 the rainbow is making room for the young americans twenty years ago our young people were dying in a war for which they could not even vote twenty years later young america has the power to stop a war in central america and the responsibility to vote in great numbers young america must be politically active in the choice is war or peace we must make room for young america 
 the rainbow includes disabled veterans the color scheme fits in the rainbow the disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed while the have their genius revealed and their disability concealed but ultimately we must judge people by their values and their contribution leave anybody out i would rather have roosevelt in a wheelchair than reagan on a horse 
 the rainbow is making room for small farmers they have suffered tremendously under the reagan regime they will either receive percent parity or percent charity we must address their concerns and make room for them the rainbow includes lesbians and gays no american citizen ought be denied equal protection from the law 
 we must be unusually committed and caring as we expand our family to include new members all of us must be tolerant and understanding as the fears and anxieties of the rejected and the party leadership express themselves in many different ways too often what we call hate as if it were some philosophy or strategy is simply ignorance anxiety paranoia fear and insecurity to be strong leaders we must be as we seek to right the wrongs of our party and our nation we must expand our party heal our party and unify our party that is our mission in 
 we are often reminded that we live in a great nation and we do but it can be greater still the rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness we must not measure greatness from the mansion down but the manger up jesus said that we should not be judged by the bark we wear but by the fruit that we bear jesus said that we must measure greatness by how we treat the least of these 
 president reagan says the nation is in recovery those corporations that made a profit last year but paid no federal taxes are recovering the military contractors who have benefited from more than doubling of the military budget in peacetime surely they are recovering the big corporations and rich individuals who received the bulk of a multibillion tax cut from mr reagan are recovering but no such recovery is under way for the least of these 
 rising tides lift all boats particularly those stuck at the bottom for the boats stuck at the bottom a misery index this administration has made life more miserable for the poor its attitude has been contemptuous its policies and programs have been cruel and unfair to working people they must be held accountable in november for increasing infant mortality among the poor in detroit one of the great cities of the western world babies are dying at the same rate as honduras the most underdeveloped nation in our hemisphere this administration must be held accountable for policies that have contributed to the growing poverty in america there are now million people in poverty percent of our nation million are white million black hispanic asian and others mostly women and children by the end of this year there will be million people in poverty we cannot stand idly by we must fight for a change now 
 under this regime we look at social security the budget cuts included nine permanent social security benefit cuts totaling billion over five years small businesses have suffered under reagan tax cuts only percent of total business tax cuts went to them percent to big businesses health care under mr reagan has already been sharply cut education under mr reagan has been cut percent under mr reagan there are now million female head families they represent percent of all families half of all of them are poor percent of all poor children live in a house headed by a woman where there is no man under mr reagan the administration has cleaned up only of priority toxic waste dumps farmers real net income was only about half its level in 
 many say that the race in november will be decided in the south president reagan is depending on the conservative south to return him to office but the south i tell you is unnaturally conservative the south is the poorest region in our nation and therefore has the least to conserve in his appeal to the south mr reagan is trying to substitute flags and prayer cloths for food and clothing and education health care and housing 
 mr reagan will ask us to pray and i believe in prayer i have come to this way by the power of prayer but then we must watch false prophecy he cuts energy assistance to the poor cuts breakfast programs from children cuts lunch programs from children cuts job training from children and then says to an empty table let us pray apparently he is not familiar with the structure of a prayer you thank the lord for the food that you are about to receive not the food that just left i think that we should pray but pray for the food that left pray for the man that took the food to leave we need a change we need a change in november 
 under mr reagan the misery index has risen for the poor the danger index has risen for everybody under this administration lost the lives of our boys in central america and honduras in grenada in lebanon in nuclear standoff in europe under this administration of our children believe they will die in a nuclear war the danger index is increasing in this world all the talk about the defense against russia the russian submarines are closer and their missiles are more accurate we live in a world tonight more miserable and a world more dangerous 
 while reaganomics and reaganism is talked about often so often we miss the real meaning reaganism is a spirit and reaganomics represents the real economic facts of life in mr george bush a man with reasonable access to mr reagan did an analysis of mr economic plan mr george bush concluded that plan was voodoo economics he was right candidate john anderson said a combination of military spending tax cuts and a balanced budget by would be accomplished with blue smoke and mirrors they were both right 
 mr reagan talks about a dynamic recovery some measure of recovery three and a half years later unemployment has inched just below where it was when he took office in there are still million people officially unemployed million working only inflation has come down but analyze for a moment who has paid the price for this superficial economic recovery 
 mr reagan curbed inflation by cutting consumer demand he cut consumer demand with conscious and callous fiscal and monetary policies he used the federal budget to deliberately induce unemployment and curb social spending he then weighed and supported tight monetary policies of the federal reserve board to deliberately drive up interest rates again to curb consumer demand created through borrowing unemployment reached percent we experienced skyrocketing interest rates our dollar inflated abroad there were record bank failures record farm foreclosures record business bankruptcies record budget deficits record trade deficits 
 mr reagan brought inflation down by destabilizing our economy and disrupting family life he promised he promised in a balanced budget but instead we now have a record billion dollar budget deficit under mr reagan the cumulative budget deficit for his four years is more than the sum total of deficits from george washington to jimmy carter combined i tell you we need a change 
 how is he paying for these jobs economic recovery is being financed by deficit spending billion dollars a year military spending a major cause of this deficit is projected over the next five years to be nearly trillion dollars and will cost about dollars for every taxpaying family when the government borrows billion dollars annually to finance the deficit this encourages the private sector to make its money off of interest rates as opposed to development and economic growth 
 even money abroad we have enough money domestically to finance the debt so we are now borrowing money abroad from foreign banks governments and financial institutions billion dollars in billion dollars in percent of our total over billion dollars percent of our total in by it is projected that percent of all individual income taxes will be going just to pay for interest on that debt the united states used to be the largest exporter of capital but under mr reagan we will quite likely become the largest debtor nation 
 about two weeks ago on july the th we celebrated our declaration of independence yet every day economics is making our nation more economically dependent and less economically free five to six percent of our gross national product is now being eaten up with president budget deficits to depend on foreign military powers to protect our national security would be foolish making us dependent and less secure yet reaganomics has us increasingly dependent on foreign economic sources this but recovery is unbalanced and artificial we have a challenge as democrats to point a way out 
 democracy guarantees opportunity not success 
 democracy guarantees the right to participate not a license for either a majority or a minority to dominate 
 the victory for the rainbow coalition in the platform debates today was not whether we won or lost but that we raised the right issues we could afford to lose the vote issues are we could not afford to avoid raising the right questions our and our moral integrity were at stake our heads are perhaps bloody but not bowed our back is straight we can go home and face our people our vision is clear 
 when we think on this journey from to championship that we have gone from the planks of the boardwalk in atlantic city in to fighting to help write the planks in the platform in san francisco in there is a deep and abiding sense of joy in our souls in spite of the tears in our eyes though there are missing planks there is a solid foundation upon which to build our party can win but we must provide hope which will inspire people to struggle and achieve provide a plan that shows a way out of our dilemma and then lead the way 
 in my heart is made to feel glad because i know there is a way out justice the requirement for rebuilding america is justice the linchpin of progressive politics in our nation will not come from the north they in fact will come from the south that is why i argue over and over again we look from virginia around to texas only one black congressperson out of nineteen years later locked out of the congress the senate and the mansion what does this large black vote mean why do i fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and elections why do we fight over that because i tell you you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them unless you linger there 
 if you want a change in this nation you enforce that voting rights act get to black hispanics female and progressive congresspersons from the south we can save the cotton but got to fight the boll weevils got to make a judgment got to make a judgment 
 it is not enough to hope era will pass how can we pass era if blacks vote in great numbers progressive whites win the only way progressive whites win if blacks vote in great numbers hispanics win when blacks hispanics and progressive whites vote women win when women win children win when women and children win workers win we must all come up together we must come up together 
 thank you 
 for all of our joy and excitement we must not save the world and lose our souls we should never enforcing the voting rights act at every level when one of us all of us will rise justice is the way out peace is the way out we should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable 
 in this world in which we live we dropped the bomb on japan and felt guilty but in other folks have also got bombs this time if we drop the bomb six minutes later we too will be destroyed not about dropping the bomb on somebody it is about dropping the bomb on everybody we must choose to develop minds over guided missiles and think it out and not fight it out time for a change 
 our foreign policy must be characterized by mutual respect not by gunboat diplomacy big stick diplomacy and threats our nation at its best feeds the hungry our nation at its worst at its worst will mine the harbors of nicaragua at its worst will try to overthrow their government at its worst will cut aid to american education and increase the aid to el salvador at its worst our nation will have partnerships with south africa a moral disgrace a moral disgrace a moral disgrace 
 we look at africa we cannot just focus on apartheid in southern africa we must fight for trade with africa and not just aid to africa we cannot stand idly by and say we will not relate to nicaragua unless they have elections there and then embrace military regimes in africa overthrowing democratic governments in nigeria and liberia and ghana we must fight for democracy all around the world and play the game by one set of rules 
 peace in this world our present formula for peace in the middle east is inadequate it will not work there are nations in the middle east our nation must be able to talk and act and influence all of them we must build upon camp david and measure human rights by one yard stick in that region we have too many interests and too few friends 
 there is a way out jobs put america back to work when i was a child growing up in greenville south carolina the reverend sample used to preach every so often a sermon relating to jesus and he said if i be lifted up draw all men unto me i quite understand what he meant as a child growing up but i understand a little better now if you raise up truth magnetic it has a way of drawing people 
 with all this confusion in this convention the bright lights and parties and big fun we must raise up the simple proposition if we lift up a program to feed the hungry come running if we lift up a program to study war no more our youth will come running if we lift up a program to put america back to work and an alternative to welfare and despair they will come working 
 if we cut that military budget without cutting our defense and use that money to rebuild bridges and put steel workers back to work and use that money and provide jobs for our cities and use that money to build schools and pay teachers and educate our children and build hospitals and train doctors and train nurses the whole nation will come running to us 
 as i leave you now we vote in this convention and get ready to go back across this nation in a couple of days in this campaign tried to be faithful to my promise i lived in old barrios ghettos and reservations and housing projects i have a message for our youth i challenge them to put hope in their brains and not dope in their veins i told them that like jesus i too was born in the slum but just because born in the slum does not mean the slum is born in you and you can rise above it if your mind is made up i told them in every slum there are two sides when i see a broken window the slummy side train some youth to become a glazier the sunny side when i see a missing brick the slummy side let that child in the union and become a brick mason and build the sunny side when i see a missing door the slummy side train some youth to become a carpenter the sunny side and when i see the vulgar words and hieroglyphics of destitution on the walls the slummy side train some youth to become a painter an artist the sunny side 
 we leave this place looking for the sunny side because a brighter side somewhere more convinced than ever that we can win we will vault up the rough side of the mountain we can win i just want young america to do me one favor just one favor exercise the right to dream you must face reality that which is but then dream of a reality that ought to be that must be live beyond the pain of reality with the dream of a bright tomorrow use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress use love to motivate you and obligate you to serve the human family 
 young america dream choose the human race over the nuclear race bury the weapons and burn the people dream dream of a new value system teachers who teach for life and not just for a living teach because they help it dream of lawyers more concerned about justice than a judgeship dream of doctors more concerned about public health than personal wealth dream of preachers and priests who will prophesy and not just profiteer preach and dream 
 our time has come our time has come suffering breeds character character breeds faith in the end faith will not disappoint our time has come our faith hope and dreams will prevail our time has come weeping has endured for nights but now joy cometh in the morning our time has come no grave can hold our body down our time has come no lie can live forever our time has come we must leave racial battle ground and come to economic common ground and moral higher ground america our time has come we come from disgrace to amazing grace our time has come give me your tired give me your poor your huddled masses who yearn to breathe free and come november there will be a change because our time has come 
 
 statement on the articles of impeachment 
 barbara jordan 
 delivered july house judiciary committee 
 mr chairman i join my colleague mr rangel in thanking you for giving the junior members of this committee the glorious opportunity of sharing the pain of this inquiry mr chairman you are a strong man and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as much assistance as possible 
 earlier today we heard the beginning of the preamble to the constitution of the united states we the people a very eloquent beginning but when that document was completed on the seventeenth of september in i was not included in that we the people i felt somehow for many years that george washington and alexander hamilton just left me out by mistake but through the process of amendment interpretation and court decision i have finally been included in we the people 
 today i am an inquisitor an hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that i feel right now my faith in the constitution is whole it is complete it is total and i am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the subversion the destruction of the constitution 
 who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves federalist no the subject of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men that is what we are talking about in other words the jurisdiction comes from the abuse of violation of some public trust it is wrong i suggest it is a misreading of the constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced that the president should be removed from office the constitution say that the powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the legislature against and upon the encroachments of the executive the division between the two branches of the legislature the house and the senate assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other the right to judge the framers of this constitution were very astute they did not make the accusers and the judges the same person 
 we know the nature of impeachment we have been talking about it awhile now it is chiefly designed for the president and his high ministers to somehow be called into account it is designed to bridle the executive if he engages in excesses it is designed as a method of national inquest into the public men the framers confined in the congress the power if need be to remove the president in order to strike a delicate balance between a president swollen with power and grown tyrannical and preservation of the independence of the executive the nature of impeachment is a narrowly channeled exception to the maxim the federal convention of said that 
 the framers limited impeachment to high crimes and misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term maladministration it is to be used only for great misdemeanors so it was said in the north carolina ratification convention and in the virginia ratification convention we do not trust our liberty to a particular branch we need one branch to check the others 
 the north carolina ratification convention no one need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity prosecutions of impeachments will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community said hamilton in the federalist papers no and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused i do not mean political parties in that sense 
 the drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment but impeachment must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term high crimes and misdemeanors of the impeachment process it was woodrow wilson who said that nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed and effectiveness indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction but nothing else can 
 common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons congress has a lot to do appropriation tax reform health insurance campaign finance reform housing environmental protection energy sufficiency mass transportation pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems so today we are not being petty we are trying to be big because the task we have before us is a big one 
 this morning in a discussion of the evidence we were told that the evidence which purports to support the allegations of misuse of the cia by the president is thin we are told that that evidence is insufficient what that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what the president did know on june the rd 
 the president did know that it was republican money that it was money from the committee for the of the president which was found in the possession of one of the burglars arrested on june the th what the president did know on the rd of june was the prior activities of e howard hunt which included his participation in the of daniel psychiatrist which included howard participation in the dita beard itt affair which included howard fabrication of cables designed to discredit the kennedy administration 
 we were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the president of the united states there has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any additional materials from the president the committee subpoena is outstanding and if the president wants to supply that material the committee sits here the fact is that on yesterday the american people waited with great anxiety for eight hours not knowing whether their president would obey an order of the supreme court of the united states 
 at this point i would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of actions the president has engaged in impeachment criteria james madison from the virginia ratification convention if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him he may be impeached 
 we have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants of money the president had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds collected for the presidential campaign we know that the president met with mr henry petersen times to discuss matters related to watergate and immediately thereafter met with the very persons who were implicated in the information mr petersen was receiving and transmitting to the president the words are if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person he may be impeached 
 justice story impeachment is intended for occasional and extraordinary cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their rights and rescue their liberties from violations 
 we know about the huston plan we know about the of the office we know that there was absolute complete direction in august when the president instructed ehrlichman to do whatever is necessary this instruction led to a surreptitious entry into dr office 
 protect their rights rescue their liberties from violation 
 the south carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria those are impeachable who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 beginning shortly after the watergate and continuing to the present time the president has engaged in a series of public statements and actions designed to thwart the lawful investigation by government prosecutors moreover the president has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the watergate case which the evidence will show he knew to be false these assertions false assertions impeachable those who misbehave those who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 james madison again at the constitutional convention a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 the constitution charges the president with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed and yet the president has counseled his aides to commit perjury willfully disregarded the secrecy of grand jury proceedings concealed surreptitious entry attempted to compromise a federal judge while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice 
 a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 if the impeachment provision in the constitution of the united states will not reach the offenses charged here then perhaps that th century constitution should be abandoned to a th century paper shredder 
 has the president committed offenses and planned and directed and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the constitution will not tolerate the question we know that we know the question we should now forthwith proceed to answer the question it is reason and not passion which must guide our deliberations guide our debate and guide our decision 
 
 farewell address to congress 
 general douglas macarthur 
 delivered april 
 mr president mr speaker and distinguished members of the congress 
 i stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride humility in the weight of those great american architects of our history who have stood here before me pride in the reflection that this home of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet devised here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race i do not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration they must be resolved on the highest plane of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected i trust therefore that you will do me the justice of receiving that which i have to say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow american 
 i address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life with but one purpose in mind to serve my country the issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector oblivious to those of another is but to court disaster for the whole while asia is commonly referred to as the gateway to europe it is no less true that europe is the gateway to asia and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other there are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts that we cannot divide our effort i can think of no greater expression of defeatism if a potential enemy can divide his strength on two fronts it is for us to counter his effort the communist threat is a global one its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every other sector you can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in asia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in europe 
 beyond pointing out these general truisms i shall confine my discussion to the general areas of asia before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there he must comprehend something of past and the revolutionary changes which have marked her course up to the present long exploited by the colonial powers with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice individual dignity or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the philippines the peoples of asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity a heretofore unfelt dignity and the of political freedom 
 mustering half of the population and percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force both moral and material with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not this is the direction of asian progress and it may not be stopped it is a corollary to the shift of the world economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area whence it started 
 in this situation it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era is now past and the asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny what they seek now is friendly guidance understanding and support not imperious direction the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation their standard of life pitifully low is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in wake world ideologies play little part in asian thinking and are little understood what the peoples strive for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs a little better clothing on their backs a little firmer roof over their heads and the realization of the normal nationalist urge for political freedom these conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism 
 of more direct and immediately bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the pacific ocean in the course of the past war prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the united states lay on the literal line of the americas with an exposed island salient extending out through hawaii midway and guam to the philippines that salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack 
 the pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas all this was changed by our pacific victory our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire pacific ocean which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we held it indeed it acts as a protective shield for all of the americas and all free lands of the pacific ocean area we control it to the shores of asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the aleutians to the mariannas held by us and our free allies from this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every asiatic port from vladivostok to singapore with sea and air power every port as i said from vladivostok to singapore and prevent any hostile movement into the pacific 
 any predatory attack from asia must be an amphibious effort no amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance with naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases any major attack from continental asia toward us or our friends in the pacific would be doomed to failure 
 under such conditions the pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader it assumes instead the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense it envisions no attack against anyone nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations but properly maintained would be an invincible defense against aggression the holding of this literal defense line in the western pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment 
 this is a military estimate as to which i have yet to find a military leader who will take exception for that reason i have strongly recommended in the past as a matter of military urgency that under no circumstances must formosa fall under communist control such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the philippines and the loss of japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of california oregon and washington 
 to understand the changes which now appear upon the chinese mainland one must understand the changes in chinese character and culture over the past years china up to years ago was completely being compartmented into groups divided against each other the tendency was almost as they still followed the tenets of the confucian ideal of pacifist culture at the turn of the century under the regime of chang tso lin efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge this was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of chiang but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant aggressive tendencies 
 through these past years the chinese people have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals they now constitute excellent soldiers with competent staffs and commanders this has produced a new and dominant power in asia which for its own purposes is allied with soviet russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become aggressively imperialistic with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of imperialism 
 there is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the chinese the standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war that the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies 
 i have from the beginning believed that the chinese communists support of the north koreans was the dominant one their interests are at present parallel with those of the soviet but i believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in korea but also in and tibet and pointing potentially toward the south reflects predominantly the same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every conqueror since the beginning of time 
 the japanese people since the war have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history with a commendable will eagerness to learn and marked capacity to understand they have from the ashes left in wake erected in japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality freedom of economic enterprise and social justice 
 politically economically and socially japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust that it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficial influence over the course of events in asia is attested by the magnificent manner in which the japanese people have met the recent challenge of war confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress i sent all four of our occupation divisions to the korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon japan the results fully justified my faith i know of no nation more serene orderly and industrious nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race 
 of our former ward the philippines we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of terrible destructiveness we must be patient and understanding and never fail them as in our hour of need they did not fail us a christian nation the philippines stand as a mighty bulwark of christianity in the far east and its capacity for high moral leadership in asia is unlimited 
 on formosa the government of the republic of china has had the opportunity to refute by action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the chinese mainland the formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration with majority representation on the organs of government and politically economically and socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines 
 with this brief insight into the surrounding areas i now turn to the korean conflict while i was not consulted prior to the decision to intervene in support of the republic of korea that decision from a military standpoint proved a sound one as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces our victory was complete and our objectives within reach when red china intervened with numerically superior ground forces 
 this created a new war and an entirely new situation a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed against the north korean invaders a situation which called for new decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy 
 such decisions have not been forthcoming 
 while no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental china and such was never given a thought the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old 
 apart from the military need as i saw it to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the yalu i felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary first the intensification of our economic blockade against china two the imposition of a naval blockade against the china coast three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of coastal areas and of manchuria four removal of restrictions on the forces of the republic of china on formosa with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy 
 for entertaining these views all professionally designed to support our forces committed to korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless american and allied lives i have been severely criticized in lay circles principally abroad despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the korean campaign including our own joint chiefs of staff 
 i called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available i made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy bases north of the yalu if not permitted to utilize the friendly chinese force of some men on formosa if not permitted to blockade the china coast to prevent the chinese reds from getting succor from without and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory 
 we could hold in korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential i have constantly called for the new political decisions essential to a solution 
 efforts have been made to distort my position it has been said in effect that i was a warmonger nothing could be further from the truth i know war as few other men now living know it and nothing to me is more revolting i have long advocated its complete abolition as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes indeed on the second day of september nineteen hundred and just following the surrender of the japanese nation on the battleship missouri i formally cautioned as follows 
 men since the beginning of time have sought peace various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations from the very start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never been successful military alliances balances of power leagues of nations all in turn failed leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war the utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative we have had our last chance if we will not devise some greater and more equitable system armageddon will be at our door the problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science art literature and all material and cultural developments of the past years it must be of the spirit 
 if we are to save the flesh 
 but once war is forced upon us there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end 
 very object is victory not prolonged indecision 
 in war there is no substitute for victory 
 there are some who for varying reasons would appease red china they are blind to clear lesson for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war it points to no single instance where this end has justified that means where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace like blackmail it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until as in blackmail violence becomes the only other alternative 
 why my soldiers asked of me surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field i could not answer 
 some may say to avoid spread of the conflict into an war with china others to avoid soviet intervention neither explanation seems valid for china is already engaging with the maximum power it can commit and the soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves like a cobra any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a basis 
 the tragedy of korea is further heightened by the fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits it condemns that nation which it is our purpose to save to suffer the devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the sanctuaries are fully protected from such attack and devastation 
 of the nations of the world korea alone up to now is the sole one which has risked its all against communism the magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the korean people defies description 
 they have chosen to risk death rather than slavery their last words to me were scuttle the pacific 
 i have just left your fighting sons in korea they have met all tests there and i can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way 
 it was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety 
 those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always 
 i am closing my years of military service when i joined the army even before the turn of the century it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams the world has turned over many times since i took the oath on the plain at west point and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished but i still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die they just fade away 
 and like the old soldier of that ballad i now close my military career and just fade away an old soldier who tried to do his duty as god gave him the light to see that duty 
 good bye 
 
 been to the mountaintop 
 martin luther king jr 
 delivered april in memphis tennessee 
 thank you very kindly my friends as i listened to ralph abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself i wondered who he was talking about always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you and ralph abernathy is the best friend that i have in the world delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning you reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow 
 something is happening in memphis something is happening in our world and you know if i were standing at the beginning of time with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now and the almighty said to me martin luther king which age would you like to live in i would take my mental flight by egypt and i would watch children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of egypt through or rather across the red sea through the wilderness on toward the promised land and in spite of its magnificence i stop there 
 i would move on by greece and take my mind to mount olympus and i would see plato aristotle socrates euripides and aristophanes assembled around the parthenon and i would watch them around the parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality but i stop there 
 i would go on even to the great heyday of the roman empire and i would see developments around there through various emperors and leaders but i stop there i would even come up to the day of the renaissance and get a quick picture of all that the renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man but i stop there i would even go by the way that the man for whom named had his habitat and i would watch martin luther as he tacked his theses on the door at the church in wittenberg but i stop there 
 i would come on up even to and watch a vacillating president by the name of abraham lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the emancipation proclamation but i stop there 
 i would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation and come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but fear itself but i stop there 
 strangely enough i would turn to the almighty and say if you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the th century i will be happy 
 now a strange statement to make because the world is all messed up the nation is sick trouble is in the land confusion all around a strange statement but i know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars and i see god working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men in some strange way are responding something is happening in our world 
 the masses of people are rising up and wherever they are assembled today whether they are in johannesburg south africa nairobi kenya accra ghana new york city atlanta georgia jackson mississippi or memphis tennessee the cry is always the same we want to be free 
 and another reason that happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history but the demands force them to do it survival demands that we grapple with them men for years now have been talking about war and peace but now no longer can they just talk about it it is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world nonviolence or nonexistence that is where we are today 
 and also in the human rights revolution if something done and done in a hurry to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty their long years of hurt and neglect the whole world is doomed now just happy that god has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding and happy that allowed me to be in memphis 
 i can remember i can remember when negroes were just going around as ralph has said so often scratching where they itch and laughing when they were not tickled but that day is all over we mean business now and we are determined to gain our rightful place in world 
 and all this whole thing is about we engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody we are saying that we are determined to be men we are determined to be people we are saying that we are children and that we have to live like we are forced to live 
 now what does all of this mean in this great period of history it means that got to stay together got to stay together and maintain unity you know whenever pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in egypt he had a favorite favorite formula for doing it what was that he kept the slaves fighting among themselves but whenever the slaves get together something happens in court and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery when the slaves get together the beginning of getting out of slavery now let us maintain unity 
 secondly let us keep the issues where they are the issue is injustice the issue is the refusal of memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants who happen to be sanitation workers now got to keep attention on that always the problem with a little violence you know what happened the other day and the press dealt only with the i read the articles they very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand three hundred sanitation workers were on strike and that memphis is not being fair to them and that mayor loeb is in dire need of a doctor they get around to that 
 now going to march again and got to march again in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of children here suffering sometimes going hungry going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out the issue and got to say to the nation we know coming out for when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it there is no stopping point short of victory 
 we going to let any mace stop us we are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces they know what to do seen them so often i remember in birmingham alabama when we were in that majestic struggle there we would move out of the th street baptist church day after day by the hundreds we would move out and bull connor would tell them to send the dogs forth and they did come but we just went before the dogs singing gonna let nobody turn me around bull connor next would say turn the fire hoses on and as i said to you the other night bull connor know history he knew a kind of physics that somehow relate to the transphysics that we knew about and that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out and we went before the fire hoses we had known water if we were baptist or some other denomination we had been immersed if we were methodist and some others we had been sprinkled but we knew water 
 that stop us and we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them and go on before the water hoses and we would look at it and just go on singing over my head i see freedom in the air and then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can and they would throw us in and old bull would say take them off and they did and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing we shall overcome and every now and then get in the jail and see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers and being moved by our words and our songs and there was a power there which bull connor adjust to and so we ended up transforming bull into a steer and we won our struggle in birmingham 
 now got to go on to memphis just like that i call upon you to be with us monday now about injunctions we have an injunction and going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal unconstitutional injunction all we say to america is be true to what you said on paper if i lived in china or even russia or any totalitarian country maybe i could understand the denial of certain basic first amendment privileges because they committed themselves to that over there but somewhere i read of the freedom of assembly somewhere i read of the freedom of speech somewhere i read of the freedom of the press somewhere i read that the greatness of america is the right to protest for right and so just as i say we going to let any injunction turn us around we are going on 
 we need all of you and you know beautiful tome is to see all of these ministers of the gospel a marvelous picture who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher somehow the preacher must be an amos and say let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream somehow the preacher must say with jesus the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor 
 and i want to commend the preachers under the leadership of these noble men james lawson one who has been in this struggle for many years been to jail for struggling but still going on fighting for the rights of his people rev ralph jackson billy kiles i could just go right on down the list but time will not permit but i want to thank them all and i want you to thank them because so often preachers concerned about anything but themselves and always happy to see a relevant ministry 
 all right to talk about long white robes over yonder in all of its symbolism but ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here all right to talk about streets flowing with milk and honey but god has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here and his children who eat three square meals a day all right to talk about the new jerusalem but one day preachers must talk about the new york the new atlanta the new philadelphia the new los angeles the new memphis tennessee this is what we have to do 
 now the other thing have to do is this always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal now we are poor people individually we are poor when you compare us with white society in america we are poor never stop and forget that collectively that means all of us together collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world with the exception of nine did you ever think about that after you leave the united states soviet russia great britain west germany france and i could name the others the negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world we have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year which is more than all of the exports of the united states and more than the national budget of canada did you know that power right there if we know how to pool it 
 we have to argue with anybody we have to curse and go around acting bad with our words we need any bricks and bottles we need any molotov cocktails we just need to go around to these stores and to these massive industries in our country and say god sent us by here to say to you that not treating his children right and come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment where children are concerned now if you are not prepared to do that we do have an agenda that we must follow and our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you 
 and so as a result of this we are asking you tonight to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy in memphis go by and tell them not to buy sealtest milk tell them not to buy what is the other bread wonder bread and what is the other bread company jesse tell them not to buy bread as jesse jackson has said up to now only the garbage men have been feeling pain now we must kind of redistribute the pain we are choosing these companies because they been fair in their hiring policies and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike and then they can move on downtown and tell mayor loeb to do what is right 
 but not only that got to strengthen black institutions i call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in bank we want a movement in memphis so go by the savings and loan association not asking you something we do ourselves at sclc judge hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the southern christian leadership conference just telling you to follow what doing put your money there you have six or seven black insurance companies in memphis take out your insurance there we want to have an 
 now these are some practical things we can do we begin the process of building a greater economic base and at the same time we are putting pressure where it really hurts i ask you to follow through here 
 now let me say as i move to my conclusion that got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in memphis got to see it through and when we have our march you need to be there be concerned about your brother you may not be on strike but either we go up together or we go down together 
 let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness one day a man came to jesus and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters in life at points he wanted to trick jesus and show him that he knew a little more than jesus knew and through this throw him off base now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate but jesus immediately pulled that question from and placed it on a dangerous curve between jerusalem and jericho and he talked about a certain man who fell among thieves you remember that a levite and a priest passed by on the other side they stop to help him and finally a man of another race came by he got down from his beast decided not to be compassionate by proxy but with him administering first aid and helped the man in need jesus ended up saying this was the good man this was the great man because he had the capacity to project the i into the thou and to be concerned about his brother now you know we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the levite stop at times we say they were busy going to church meetings an ecclesiastical gathering and they had to get on down to jerusalem so they be late for their meeting at other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that one who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body hours before the ceremony and every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to jerusalem or down to jericho rather to organize a jericho road improvement association a possibility maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root rather than to get bogged down with an individual effort 
 but going to tell you what my imagination tells me possible that these men were afraid you see the jericho road is a dangerous road 
 i remember when mrs king and i were first in jerusalem we rented a car and drove from jerusalem down to jericho and as soon as we got on that road i said to my wife i can see why jesus used this as a setting for his parable a winding meandering road really conducive for ambushing you start out in jerusalem which is about miles or rather feet above sea level and by the time you get down to jericho fifteen or twenty minutes later about feet below sea level a dangerous road in the days of jesus it came to be known as the bloody pass and you know possible that the priest and the levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around or possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking and he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there lure them there for quick and easy seizure and so the first question that the priest asked the first question that the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me but then the good samaritan came by and he reversed the question if i do not stop to help this man what will happen to him 
 the question before you tonight not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to my job not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that i usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor the question is not if i stop to help this man in need what will happen to me the question is if i do not stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to them the question 
 let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness let us stand with a greater determination and let us move on in these powerful days these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be we have an opportunity to make america a better nation and i want to thank god once more for allowing me to be here with you 
 you know several years ago i was in new york city autographing the first book that i had written and while sitting there autographing books a demented black woman came up the only question i heard from her was are you martin luther king and i was looking down writing and i said yes and the next minute i felt something beating on my chest before i knew it i had been stabbed by this demented woman i was rushed to harlem hospital it was a dark saturday afternoon and that blade had gone through and the revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta the main artery and once punctured you drown in your own blood the end of you 
 it came out in the new york times the next morning that if i had merely sneezed i would have died well about four days later they allowed me after the operation after my chest had been opened and the blade had been taken out to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital they allowed me to read some of the mail that came in and from all over the states and the world kind letters came in i read a few but one of them i will never forget i had received one from the president and the forgotten what those telegrams said received a visit and a letter from the governor of new york but forgotten what that letter said but there was another letter that came from a little girl a young girl who was a student at the white plains high school and i looked at that letter and never forget it it said simply dear dr king i am a student at the white plains high school and she said while it should not matter i would like to mention that a white girl i read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering and i read that if you had sneezed you would have died and simply writing you to say that so happy that you sneeze 
 and i want to say tonight i want to say tonight that i too am happy that i sneeze because if i had sneezed i have been around here in when students all over the south started at lunch counters and i knew that as they were sitting in they were really standing up for the best in the american dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the declaration of independence and the constitution if i had sneezed i have been around here in when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in travel if i had sneezed i have been around here in when negroes in albany georgia decided to straighten their backs up and whenever men and women straighten their backs up they are going somewhere because a man ride your back unless it is bent if i had sneezed if i had sneezed i have been here in when the black people of birmingham alabama aroused the conscience of this nation and brought into being the civil rights bill if i had sneezed i have had a chance later that year in august to try to tell america about a dream that i had had if i had sneezed i have been down in selma alabama to see the great movement there if i had sneezed i have been in memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering so happy that i sneeze 
 and they were telling me now it matter now it really matter what happens now i left atlanta this morning and as we got started on the plane there were six of us the pilot said over the public address system we are sorry for the delay but we have dr martin luther king on the plane and to be sure that all of the bags were checked and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane we had to check out everything carefully and had the plane protected and guarded all night 
 and then i got into memphis and some began to say the threats or talk about the threats that were out what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers 
 well i know what will happen now got some difficult days ahead but it matter with me now because been to the mountaintop and i mind 
 like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but not concerned about that now i just want to do will and allowed me to go up to the mountain and looked over and seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get will get to the promised land 
 and so happy tonight not worried about anything not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord 
 
 the man with the 
 theodore teddy roosevelt 
 delivered april 
 over a century ago washington laid the of the capitol in what was then little more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the potomac we now find it necessary to provide great additional buildings for the business of the government this growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has grown we now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population has been outstripped by the growth of wealth and the growth in complex interests 
 the material problems that face us are not such as they were in washingtons time but the underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then under altered external form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in washingtons time and are helped by the same tendencies for good 
 it is about some of these that i wish to say a word in bunyans pilgrims progress you may recall the description of the man with the the man who could look no way but downward with the in his hand who was offered a celestial crown for his but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor 
 in pilgrims progress the man with the is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of on spiritual things yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing now it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing there is filth on the floor and it must be scraped up with the and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed but the man who never does anything else who never thinks or speaks or writes save of his feats with the speedily becomes not a help to society not an incitement to good but one of the most potent forces for evil 
 there are in the body politic economic and social many and grave evils and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them there should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man every evil practice whether in politics in business or in social life i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who on the platform or in book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful the liar is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves it puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest man or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth an epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does not good but very great harm the soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed 
 now it is easy to twist out of shape what i have just said easy to affect to misunderstand it and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it some persons are sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce does not mean the endorsement of whitewashing and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing and those others who practice like to encourage such confusion of ideas one of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked who ought to be exposed who ought if possible to be put in the penitentiary if aristides is praised overmuch as just people get tired of hearing it and overcensure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons results in their favor 
 any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction and unfortunately the reaction instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess is very apt to take the form either of punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity and even strength to offenders the effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in public calamity gross and reckless assaults on character whether on the stump or in newspaper magazine or book create a morbid and vicious public sentiment and at the same time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price 
 as an instance in point i may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the right type of men to dig the panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed both without and i am sorry to say sometimes within congress to utterly reckless assaults on their character and capacity 
 at the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to but for the most unsparing exposure of the politician who betrays his trust of the big business man who makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways there should be a resolute effort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced expose the crime and hunt down the criminal but remember that even in the case of crime if it is attacked in sensational lurid and untruthful fashion the attack may do more damage to the public mind than the crime itself it is because i feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil that i ask that the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution 
 the men with the are often indispensable to the of society but only if they know when to stop raking the muck and to look upward to the celestial crown above them to the crown of worthy endeavor 
 there are beautiful things above and roundabout them and if they gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck their power of usefulness is gone if the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction from their fellows such painting finally induces a kind of moral and people affected by it come to the conclusion that no man is really black and no man is really white but they are all gray in other words they neither believe in the truth of the attack nor in the honesty of the man who is attacked they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense it becomes hopeless to stir them either to wrath against or to enthusiasm for what is right and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave and is the despair of honest men 
 to assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general condemnation means the searing of the public conscience there results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad either attitude is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole the fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad there is nothing more distressing to every good patriot to every good american than the hard scoffing spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter 
 such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot for it denotes not merely the vacant mind but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition 
 there is any amount of good in the world and there never was a time when loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now the forces that tend for evil are great and terrible but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before it is a foolish and timid no less than a wicked thing to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong but it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good 
 hysterical sensationalism is the very poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness the men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time whether in the public press or in magazines or in books are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the work for social and political betterment but if they give good reason for distrust of what they say if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue they thereby betray the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at war 
 in his ecclesiastical polity that fine old elizabethan divine bishop hooker wrote he that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers because they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject but the secret lets and difficulties which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider 
 this truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people desiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of yet on the other hand it is vital not to permit this spirit to sanity and to degenerate into mere mental stagnation bad though a state of hysterical excitement is and evil though the results are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces yet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse 
 at this moment we are passing through a period of great unrestsocial political and industrial unrest it is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness against life of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of conditions but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the individual and the nation so far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce discontent with evil of a determination to punish the authors of evil whether in industry or politics the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life 
 if on the other hand it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite of a contest between the brutal greed of the and the brutal greed of the haves then it has no significance for good but only for evil if it seeks to establish a line of cleavage not along the line which divides good men from bad but along that other line running at right angles thereto which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off then it will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic 
 we can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital the wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to an account for his misdeeds is as bad as and no worse than the labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder one attitude is as bad as the other and no worse in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice and in neither case is there need of action by others which can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime 
 it is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion shall be translated into action and that the action shall be marked by honesty sanity and there is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform the reform that counts is that which comes through steady continuous growth violent emotionalism leads to exhaustion 
 it is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes and the use of those fortunes both corporate and individual in business we should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes and fortunes between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere 
 of course no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in making them as a matter of personal conviction and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system i feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individuala tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual the tax of course to be imposed by the national and not the state government 
 such taxation should of course be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits again the national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in interstate businessand all large corporations are engaged in interstate businesswhether by license or otherwise so as to permit us to deal with the evils of overcapitalization 
 this year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems by the legislation such legislation if so framed as i am sure it will be as to secure definite and tangible results will amount to something of itself and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged in interstate commerce this superintendence and control not to be exercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at large 
 the first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations whether as legislators or as executives is honesty this honesty can be no respecter of persons there can be no such thing as unilateral honesty the danger is not really from corrupt corporations it springs from the corruption itself whether exercised for or against corporations 
 the eighth commandment reads thou shalt not steal it does not read thou shalt not steal from the rich man it does not read thou shalt not steal from the poor man it reads simply and plainly thou shalt not steal 
 no good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense which denounces bribery but blinds itself to blackmail which foams with rage if a corporation secures favors by improper methods and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is itself wronged the only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression 
 if a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to rich corporations it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation 
 but in addition to honesty we need sanity no honesty will make public man useful if that man is timid or foolish if he is a zealot or an impracticable visionary 
 as we strive for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long pull on the contrary there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work to depend only on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset 
 the men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of the public by the proper government authorities will not succeed in my judgment in checking the progress of the movement but if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the whirlwind for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by steady and natural growth 
 on the other hand the wild preachers of unrest and discontent the wild agitators against the entire existing order the men who act crookedly whether because of sinister design or from mere the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute for what they intend to destroy or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than the existing evilsall these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform if they get their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under the present system if they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching would enthrone more securely than ever the very evils which their misguided followers believe they are attacking 
 more important then aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man the welfare of the the welfare of the tiller of the soil upon these depend the welfare of the entire country their good is not to be sought in pulling down others but their good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship 
 materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made 
 spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more important 
 the of national life is and ever must be the high individual character of the average citizen 
 
 remarks on the assassination of martin luther king jr 
 robert f kennedy 
 delivered april indianapolis in 
 ladies and gentlemen only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening because i have some very sad news for all of you could you lower those signs please i have some very sad news for all of you and i think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis tennessee 
 martin luther king dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings he died in the cause of that effort in this difficult day in this difficult time for the united states perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in for those of you who are black considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible you can be filled with bitterness and with hatred and a desire for revenge 
 we can move in that direction as a country in greater polarization black people amongst blacks and white amongst whites filled with hatred toward one another or we can make an effort as martin luther king did to understand and to comprehend and replace that violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand compassion and love 
 for those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling i had a member of my family killed but he was killed by a white man 
 but we have to make an effort in the united states we have to make an effort to understand to get beyond or go beyond these rather difficult times 
 my favorite poem my favorite poet was aeschylus and he once wrote 
 even in our sleep pain which cannot forget 
 falls drop by drop upon the heart 
 until in our own despair 
 against our will 
 comes wisdom 
 through the awful grace of god 
 what we need in the united states is not division what we need in the united states is not hatred what we need in the united states is not violence and lawlessness but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country whether they be white or whether they be black 
 so i ask you tonight to return home to say a prayer for the family of martin luther king yeah true but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country which all of us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which i spoke 
 we can do well in this country we will have difficult times had difficult times in the past and we will have difficult times in the future it is not the end of violence it is not the end of lawlessness and not the end of disorder 
 but the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land 
 let us dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world let us dedicate ourselves to that and say a prayer for our country and for our people 
 thank you very much 
 
 farewell address 
 dwight d eisenhower 
 delivered january 
 good evening my fellow americans 
 first i should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation my special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening 
 three days from now after a half century in the service of our country i shall lay down the responsibilities of office as in traditional and solemn ceremony the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor 
 this evening i come to you with a message of and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you my countrymen like every other citizen i wish the new president and all who will labor with him godspeed i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all 
 our people expect their president and the congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation my own relations with the congress which began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member of the senate appointed me to west point have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate period and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years in this final relationship the congress and the administration have on most vital issues cooperated well to serve the nation good rather than mere partisanship and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward so my official relationship with congress ends in a feeling on my part of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together 
 we now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations three of these involved our own country despite these holocausts america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this we yet realize that leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment 
 throughout adventure in free government our basic purposes have been to keep the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations to strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad 
 progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world it commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration to meet it successfully there is called for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake only thus shall we remain despite every provocation on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment 
 crises there will continue to be in meeting them whether foreign or domestic great or small there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties a huge increase in newer elements of our defenses development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research these and many other possibilities each possibly promising in itself may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel 
 but each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs balance between the private and the public economy balance between the cost and hoped for advantages balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future good judgment seeks balance and progress lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration the record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have in the main understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress 
 but threats new in kind or degree constantly arise of these i mention two only 
 a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea 
 until the latest of our world conflicts the united states had no armaments industry american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all united states corporations 
 now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society 
 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together 
 akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades in this revolution research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly a steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the federal government 
 today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers the prospect of domination of the scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded 
 yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a elite 
 it is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and old within the principles of our democratic system c ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society 
 another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time as we peer into future we you and i and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow 
 during the long lane of the history yet to be written america knows that this world of ours ever growing smaller must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate and be instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect such a confederation must be one of equals the weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we protected as we are by our moral economic and military strength that table though scarred by many past frustrations cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield 
 disarmament with mutual honor and confidence is a continuing imperative together we must learn how to compose differences not with arms but with intellect and decent purpose because this need is so sharp and apparent i confess that i lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment as one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years i wish i could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight 
 happily i can say that war has been avoided steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made but so much remains to be done as a private citizen i shall never cease to do what little i can to help the world advance along that road 
 so in this my last good night to you as your president i thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace i trust that in that service you find some things worthy as for the rest of it i know you will find ways to improve performance in the future 
 you and i my fellow citizens need to be strong in our faith that all nations under god will reach the goal of peace with justice may we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the nations great goals 
 to all the peoples of the world i once more give expression to prayerful and continuing aspiration we pray that peoples of all faiths all races all nations may have their great human needs satisfied that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity and that the scourges of poverty disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth and that in the goodness of time all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love 
 now on friday noon i am to become a private citizen i am proud to do so i look forward to it 
 thank you and good night 
 
 war message 
 woodrow wilson 
 delivered april 
 gentlemen of the congress 
 i have called the congress into extraordinary session because there are serious very serious choices of policy to be made and made immediately which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of making 
 on the third of february last i officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the first day of february it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of great britain and ireland or the western coasts of europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of germany within the mediterranean 
 that had seemed to be the object of the german submarine warfare earlier in the war but since april of last year the imperial government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy when no resistance was offered or escape attempted and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats 
 the precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain degree of restraint was observed the new policy has swept every restriction aside vessels of every kind whatever their flag their character their cargo their destination their errand have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the german government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity haven been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle 
 i was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations international law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world by painful stage after stage has that law been built up with meager enough results indeed after all was accomplished that could be accomplished but always with a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded 
 this minimum of right the german government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world 
 i am not now thinking of the loss of property involved immense and serious as that is but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of men women and children engaged in pursuits which have always even in the darkest periods of modern history been deemed innocent and legitimate property can be paid for the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be 
 the present german submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind 
 it is war against all nations 
 american ships have been sunk american lives taken in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way there has been no discrimination the challenge is to all mankind 
 each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it the choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation we must put excited feeling away our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right of human right of which we are only a single champion 
 when i addressed the congress on the of february last i thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms our right to use the seas against unlawful interference our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence but armed neutrality it now appears is impracticable because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the german submarines have been used against merchant shipping it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers visible craft giving chase upon the open sea it is common prudence in such circumstances grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention they must be dealt with upon sight if dealt with at all 
 the german government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend the intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents there is one choice we cannot make we are incapable of making we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated the wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs they cut to the very roots of human life 
 with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves but in unhesitating obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the government of the german empire to terms and end the war 
 what this will involve is clear 
 it will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with germany and as incident to that the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs 
 it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible 
 it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemys submarines 
 it will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the united states already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred thousand men who should in my opinion be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training 
 it will involve also of course the granting of adequate credits to the government sustained i hope so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation by well conceived taxation 
 i say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed it is our duty i most respectfully urge to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans 
 in carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty for it will be a very practical duty of supplying the nations already at war with germany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance they are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there 
 i shall take the liberty of suggesting through the several executive departments of the government for the consideration of your committees measures for the accomplishment of the several objects i have mentioned i hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall 
 while we do these things these deeply momentous things let us be very clear and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are my own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months and i do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them i have exactly the same things in mind now that i had in mind when i addressed the senate on the of january last the same that i had in mind when i addressed the congress on the third day of february and on the of february our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and peoples of the world 
 such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles 
 neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will not by the will of their people we have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances we are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states 
 we have no quarrel with the german people we have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship it was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war it was not with their previous knowledge or approval it was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools 
 nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression carried it may be from generation to generation can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class they are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nations affairs 
 a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations no autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants it must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion intrigue would eat its vitals away the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own 
 does not every american feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in russia russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart in all the vital habits of her thought in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct their habitual attitude towards life 
 the autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power was not in fact russian in origin character or purpose and now it has been shaken off and the great generous russian people have been added in all their majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world for justice and for peace here is a fit partner for a league of honor 
 one of the things that has served to convince us that the prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel our peace within and without our industries and our commerce indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation wit the support and even under the personal direction of official agents of the imperial government accredited to the government of the united states 
 even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we know that their source lay not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people towards us who were no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves were but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing but they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience that it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors that intercepted note to the german minister at mexico city is eloquent evidence 
 we are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government following such methods we can never have a friend and that in the presence of its organized power always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can be no assured security of the democratic governments of the world we are now about to accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power 
 we are glad now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the german peoples included for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience the world must be made safe for democracy its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty we have no selfish ends to serve 
 we desire no conquest no dominion we seek no indemnities for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make we are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind we shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them 
 just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples we shall i feel confident conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for i have said nothing of the governments allied with the imperial government of germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor 
 the government has indeed avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the imperial german government and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive count tarnowski the ambassador recently accredited to this government by the imperial and royal government of but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the united states on the seas and i take the liberty for the present at least of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at vienna 
 we enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights 
 it will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them but only armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck 
 we are let me say again the sincere friends of the german people and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us however hard it may be for them for the time being to believe that this is spoken from our hearts 
 we have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible 
 we shall happily still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of german birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test they are most of them as true and loyal americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance they will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose if there should be disloyalty it will be dealt with a firm hand of stern repression but if it lifts its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few 
 it is a distressing and oppressive duty gentlemen of the congress which i have performed in thus addressing you there are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance 
 but the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small nations for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world at last free 
 to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day has come when america is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured god helping her she can do no other

 on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party they always liked sitting there after dinner and that day they had work to do there too besides the sewing of chemises and knitting of swaddles with which all of them were busy that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to agathya mikhailovna without the addition of water kitty had introduced this new method which had been in use in her home agathya mikhailovna to whom the task of jam making had always been intrusted considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be amiss had nevertheless put water with the strawberries maintaining that the jam could not be made without it she had been caught in the act and was now making raspberry jam before everyone and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water 
 agathya mikhailovna her face heated and angry her hair untidy and her thin arms bare to the elbows was swaying the preserving pan in a circular motion over the charcoal stove looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly the princess conscious that agathya wrath must be chiefly directed against her as the person responsible for the raspberry jam making tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the raspberries talking of other matters but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove 
 i always buy my maids dresses myself at the bargain sale the princess said continuing the previous conversation it time to skim it my dear she added addressing agathya mikhailovna not the slightest need for you to do it and hot for you she said stopping kitty 
 do it said dolly and getting up she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with scum and syrup how lick this at teatime she thought of her children remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the people did not eat what was best of all the scum of the jam 
 stiva says much better to give money dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion of what presents should be made to servants but 
 out of the question the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice they appreciate a present 
 well last year for instance i bought our matriona semionovna not a poplin but something of that sort said the princess 
 i remember she was wearing it on your name day 
 a charming pattern so simple and refined i should have liked it myself if she had it something like so pretty and inexpensive 
 well now i think done said dolly dropping the syrup from the spoon 
 when it sets as it drops ready cook it a little longer agathya mikhailovna 
 the flies said agathya mikhailovna angrily be just the same she added 
 ah how sweet it is frighten it kitty said suddenly looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry 
 yes but you keep a little further from the stove said her mother 
 a propos de varenka said kitty speaking in french as they had been doing all the while so that agathya mikhailovna should not understand them you know maman i somehow expect things to be settled today you know what i mean how splendid it would be 
 but what a famous matchmaker she is said dolly how carefully and cleverly she throws them together 
 no tell me mamma what do you think 
 why what is one to think he he meant sergei ivanovich might at any time have been one of the best matches in russia now of course not quite a young man still i know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now a very nice girl but he might 
 oh no mamma do understand why for him and for her too nothing better could be imagined in the first place charming said kitty crooking one of her fingers 
 he thinks her very attractive certain assented dolly 
 then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife all he needs is a good sweet wife a restful one 
 well with her he would certainly be restful dolly assented 
 thirdly that she should love him and so it is that is it would be so splendid i look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest and everything settled i shall see at once by their eyes i should be so delighted what do you think dolly 
 but excite yourself not at all the thing for you to be excited said her mother 
 oh not excited mamma i fancy he will propose to her today 
 ah so strange how and when a man proposes there is a sort of barrier and all at once broken down said dolly smiling pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevich 
 mamma how did papa propose to you kitty asked suddenly 
 there was nothing out of the way it was very simple answered the princess but her face beamed all over at the recollection 
 oh but how was it you loved him at any rate before you were allowed to speak 
 kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a life 
 of course i did he had come to stay with us in the country 
 but how was it settled between you mamma 
 you imagine i dare say that you invented something quite new always just the same it was settled by the eyes by smiles 
 how well you said that mamma just by the eyes by smiles that done dolly assented 
 but what words did he say 
 what did kostia say to you 
 he wrote it in chalk it was wonderful how long ago it seems she said 
 and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing kitty was the first to break the silence she remembered all that last winter before her marriage and her passion for vronsky 
 one thing that old love affair of she said a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point i should have liked to say something to sergei ivanovich to prepare him all all men i mean she added awfully jealous over our past 
 not all said dolly you judge by your own husband it makes him miserable even now to remember vronsky eh true it 
 yes kitty answered a pensive smile in her eyes 
 but i really know the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter what there was in your past that could worry him that vronsky paid you attentions that happens to every girl 
 oh yes but we mean that kitty said flushing a little 
 no let me speak her mother went on why you yourself would not let me have a talk with vronsky you remember 
 oh mamma said kitty with an expression of suffering 
 no keeping you young people in check nowadays your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable i should myself have called upon him to explain himself but my darling not right for you to be agitated please remember that and calm yourself 
 perfectly calm maman 
 how happy it was for kitty that anna came then said dolly and how unhappy for her it turned out quite the opposite she said struck by her own ideas then anna was so happy and kitty thought herself unhappy now it is just the opposite i often think of her 
 a fine person to think about horrid repulsive woman no heart said her mother who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky but levin 
 what do you want to talk of it for kitty said with annoyance i never think about it and i want to think of it and i want to think of it she said catching the sound of her familiar step on the steps of the terrace 
 that you want to think about inquired levin coming onto the terrace 
 but no one answered him and he did not repeat the question 
 sorry broken in on your feminine kingdom he said looking round on everyone discontentedly and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him 
 for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agathya mikhailovna vexation at their making jam without water and on the whole at the outside shcherbatsky authority he smiled however and went up to kitty 
 well how are you he asked her looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now 
 oh very well said kitty smiling and how have things gone with you 
 the wagon held three times as much as the telega did well are we going for the children ordered the horses to be put in 
 what you want to take kitty in the wide droshky her mother said reproachfully 
 yes at walking pace princess 
 levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their and the princess disliked his not doing so but though he liked and respected the princess levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother 
 come with us maman said kitty 
 i like to see such imprudence 
 well walk then so well kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand 
 you may be well but everything in moderation said the princess 
 well agathya mikhailovna is the jam done said levin smiling to agathya mikhailovna and trying to cheer her up is it all right in the new way 
 i suppose all right according to our notions boiled too long 
 be all the better agathya mikhailovna it turn sour even though the ice in our icehouse has begun to melt already so that no cool place to store it said kitty at once divining her motive and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling but your pickles are so good that mamma says she never tasted any like them she added smiling and putting her kerchief straight 
 agathya mikhailovna looked sulkily at kitty 
 you try to console me mistress i need only to look at you with him and i feel happy she said and something in the rough familiarity of that with him touched kitty 
 come along with us to look for mushrooms you will show us the best places 
 agathya mikhailovna smiled and shook her head as though to say i would even like to be angry with you but i 
 do it please according to my recipe said the princess put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and even without ice it will never grow moldy

 oh very well said kitty smiling and how have things gone with you 
 the wagon held three times as much as the telega did well are we going for the children ordered the horses to be put in 
 what you want to take kitty in the wide droshky her mother said reproachfully 
 yes at walking pace princess 
 levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their and the princess disliked his not doing so but though he liked and respected the princess levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother 
 come with us maman said kitty 
 i like to see such imprudence 
 well walk then so well kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand 
 you may be well but everything in moderation said the princess 
 well agathya mikhailovna is the jam done said levin smiling to agathya mikhailovna and trying to cheer her up is it all right in the new way 
 i suppose all right according to our notions boiled too long 
 be all the better agathya mikhailovna it turn sour even though the ice in our icehouse has begun to melt already so that no cool place to store it said kitty at once divining her motive and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling but your pickles are so good that mamma says she never tasted any like them she added smiling and putting her kerchief straight 
 agathya mikhailovna looked sulkily at kitty 
 you try to console me mistress i need only to look at you with him and i feel happy she said and something in the rough familiarity of that with him touched kitty 
 come along with us to look for mushrooms you will show us the best places 
 agathya mikhailovna smiled and shook her head as though to say i would even like to be angry with you but i 
 do it please according to my recipe said the princess put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and even without ice it will never grow moldy

 kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face always so quick to reflect every feeling at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of and had got no answer 
 when they had set off on foot ahead of the others and had gotten out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road sprinkled with ears of rye and with separate grains she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with her he felt now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in being near to the woman he loved there was no need of speech yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice which like her eyes had changed since she had become pregnant in her voice as in her eyes there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit 
 so not tired lean more on me said he 
 no so glad of a chance of being alone with you and i must own though happy with them i sigh for our winter evenings alone 
 that was good but this is even better both are better he said squeezing her hand 
 do you know what we were talking about when you came in 
 about jam 
 oh yes about jam too but afterward about how men propose 
 ah said levin listening more to the sound of her voice than to her words and all the while paying attention to the road which passed now through the forest and avoiding places where she might make a false step 
 and about sergei ivanovich and varenka noticed very anxious for it she went on what do you think about it and she peeped into his face 
 i know what to think levin answered smiling sergei seems very strange to me in that way i told you you know 
 yes that he was in love with that girl who died 
 that was when i was a child i know about it from hearsay and tradition i remember him then he was wonderfully sweet but watched him since with women he is friendly some of them he likes but one feels that to him simply people not women 
 yes but now with varenka i fancy something 
 perhaps there is but one has to know him a peculiar wonderful person he lives a spiritual life only too pure too exalted a nature 
 why would this lower him then 
 no but so used to a spiritual life that he reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka is after all fact 
 levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language he knew that his wife in such moments of loving tenderness as now would understand what he meant to say from a hint and she did understand him 
 yes but not so much of that actual fact about her as about me i can see that he would never have cared for me she is altogether spiritual 
 oh no he is so fond of you and i am always so glad when my people like you 
 yes very good to me but 
 not as it was with poor nikolenka you really cared for each other levin finished why not speak of him he added i sometimes blame myself for not doing so it ends in forgetting ah how terrible and dear he was yes what were we talking about levin said after a pause 
 you think he fall in love said kitty translating into her own language 
 not so much that he fall in love levin said smiling but he has not the weakness necessary always envied him and even now when so happy i still envy him 
 you envy him for not being able to fall in love 
 i envy him for being better than me said levin he does not live for himself his whole life is subordinated to his duty and why he can be calm and contented 
 and you kitty asked with an ironical and loving smile 
 she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile but the last link in it was that her husband in exalting his brother and abasing himself was not quite sincere kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at being too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be better she loved this trait in him and so she smiled 
 and you what are you dissatisfied with she asked with the same smile 
 her disbelief in his delighted him and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief 
 i am happy but dissatisfied with myself he said 
 why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy 
 well how shall i say in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble see oh but really you skip about like that he cried breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path but when i think about myself and compare myself with others especially with my brother i feel a poor creature 
 but in what way kitty pursued with the same smile you too work for others what about your farmsteading and your agriculture and your book 
 oh but i feel and particularly just now your fault he said pressing her hand that all that count i do it in a way halfheartedly if i could care for all that as i care for you instead of that i do it in these days like a task that is set me 
 well what would you say about papa asked kitty is he a poor creature then as he does nothing for the public good 
 he no but then one must have the simplicity the the goodness of your father and i got that i do nothing and i fret about it all your doing before you and this too he added with a glance toward her waist that she understood i put all my energies into work now i and ashamed i do it just as though it were a task set me pretending 
 well but would you like to change this minute with sergei ivanovich said kitty would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he does and nothing else 
 of course not said levin but so happy that i understand anything so you think propose to her today he added after a brief silence 
 i think so and i think so only awfully anxious for it here wait a minute she stooped down and picked a wild daisy at the edge of the path come count he will he she said giving him the flower 
 he will he said levin tearing off the white petals 
 no no kitty snatching at his hand stopped him she had been watching his fingers with agitation you picked off two 
 oh but see this little one count to make up said levin tearing off a little petal the droshky overtaking us 
 you tired kitty called the princess 
 not in the least 
 if you are you can get in as the horses are quiet and walking 
 but it was not to get in they were quite near the place and all walked on together

 varenka with her white kerchief on her black hair surrounded by the children gaily and looking after them and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for was very attractive sergei ivanovich walked beside her and never left off admiring her looking at her he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips all the good he knew about her and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long long ago and only once in his early youth the feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew and at last reached such a point that as he put a huge mushroom with rolled brims in her basket he looked straight into her face and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face he was confused himself and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much 
 if so he said to himself i ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment 
 going to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my efforts will make no show he said and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart and went more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel walking some forty paces away sergei ivanovich knowing he was out of sight stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its catkins it was perfectly still all round him only overhead in the birches under which he stood the flies like a swarm of bees buzzed unceasingly and from time to time the voices floated across to him all at once he heard not far from the edge of the wood the sound of contralto voice calling grisha and a smile of delight passed over sergei face conscious of this smile he shook his head disapprovingly at his own state and taking out a cigar he began lighting it for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree the soft pellicle of the white bark stuck around the phosphorus and the light went out at last one of the matches burned and the fragrant cigar smoke hovering uncertainly in flat wide coils stretched away forward and upward over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree watching the streak of smoke sergei ivanovich walked gently on deliberating on his position 
 why not he thought if it were only a flash in the pan or a passion if it were only this attraction this mutual attraction i can call it a mutual attraction yet if i felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life if i felt that in giving way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty but not so the only thing i can say against it is that when i lost marie i said to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory the only thing i can say against my feeling a great thing sergei ivanovich said to himself feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others but apart from that however much i searched i should never find anything to say against my feeling if i were choosing by considerations of intellect alone i could not have found anything better

 varvara andreevna when i was very young i set before myself the ideal of the woman i loved and should be happy to call my wife i have lived through a long life and now for the first time i have met what i sought in you i love you and offer you my hand 
 sergei ivanovich was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from varenka kneeling down with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from grisha she was calling little masha 
 come here little ones there are so many she was saying in her sweet deep voice 
 seeing sergei ivanovich approaching she did not get up and did not change her position but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it 
 well did you find some she asked from under the white kerchief turning her handsome gently smiling face to him 
 not one said sergei ivanovich did you 
 she did not answer busy with the children who thronged about her 
 that one too near the twig she pointed out to little masha a little fungus split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself varenka got up while masha picked the fungus breaking it into two white halves this brings back my childhood she added moving apart from the children to sergei side 
 they walked on for a few steps in silence varenka saw that he wanted to speak she guessed of what and felt faint with joy and panic they had walked so far away that no one could hear them now but still he did not begin it would have been better for varenka to be silent after a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms but against her own will as it were accidentally varenka said 
 so you found nothing in the middle of the wood there are always fewer though 
 sergei ivanovich sighed and made no answer he was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms he wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood but after a pause of some length as though against his own will he made an observation in response to her last words 
 i have heard that the white edible fungi are found principally at the edge of the wood though i tell them apart 
 some minutes more passed they moved still farther away from the children and were quite alone heart throbbed so that she heard it beating and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again 
 to be the wife of a man like koznishev after her position with madame stahl was to her imagination the height of happiness besides she was almost certain that she was in love with him and this moment it would have to be decided she felt frightened she dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking 
 now or never it must be said sergei ivanovich felt that too everything in the expression the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of varenka betrayed a painful suspense sergei ivanovich saw it and felt sorry for her he felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision he even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his proposal but instead of those words some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask 
 what is the difference between the birch mushroom and the white mushroom 
 lips quivered with emotion as she answered 
 in the top part there is scarcely any difference in the stalk 
 and as soon as these words were uttered both he and she felt that it was over that what was to have been said would not be said and their emotion which up to then had been continually growing more intense began to subside 
 the birch stalk suggests a dark chin after two days without shaving said sergei ivanovich speaking quite calmly now 
 yes true answered varenka smiling and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed they began to turn toward the children varenka felt both hurt and ashamed at the same time she felt a sense of relief 
 when he had got home again and went over the whole set of arguments sergei ivanovich thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one he could not be false to the memory of marie 
 gently children gently levin shouted quite angrily to the children standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them 
 behind the children sergei ivanovich and varenka walked out of the forest kitty had no need to ask varenka she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off 
 well her husband questioned her as they were going home again 
 no bites said kitty her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure 
 no bites how 
 show you she said taking her hand lifting it to her mouth and just faintly brushing it with closed lips like a kiss on a hand 
 which one bite he said laughing 
 both but it should have been like this 
 there are some peasants coming 
 oh they see

 well her husband questioned her as they were going home again 
 no bites said kitty her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure 
 no bites how 
 show you she said taking her hand lifting it to her mouth and just faintly brushing it with closed lips like a kiss on a hand 
 which one bite he said laughing 
 both but it should have been like this 
 there are some peasants coming 
 oh they see

 during the time of the tea the grownups sat on the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened though they all especially sergei ivanovich and varenka were very well aware that there had happened an event which though negative was of very great importance they both had the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an unlucky examination which has left him in the same class or shut him out of school forever everyone present also feeling that something had happened talked eagerly about extraneous subjects levin and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable reference to those who would have liked to feel the same and could not and they felt a prick of conscience 
 mark my words alexandre will not come said the old princess 
 that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevich to come down by train and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too 
 and i know why the princess went on he says that newly married couples ought to be left alone for a while at first 
 but papa has left us alone never seen him said kitty besides not newly married old married people by now 
 only if he come i shall say to you children said the princess sighing mournfully 
 what nonsense mamma both the daughters fell upon her at once how do you suppose he is feeling why now 
 and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the voice her daughters were silent and looked at one another maman always finds something to be miserable about they said in that glance they did not know that happy as the princess was in her house and useful as she felt herself to be there she had been extremely miserable both on her own account and her ever since they had married off their last and favorite daughter and their family nest had been left empty 
 what is it agathya mikhailovna kitty asked suddenly of agathya mikhailovna who was standing with a mysterious air and a face full of meaning 
 about supper 
 well right said dolly you go and arrange about it and go and hear grisha repeat his lesson or else he will have done nothing all day 
 my duty no dolly going said levin jumping up 
 grisha who was by now at a high school had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays darya alexandrovna who had been studying latin with her son in moscow before had made it a rule on coming to the levins to go over with him at least once a day the most difficult lessons of latin and arithmetic levin had offered to take her place but the mother having once overheard lesson and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in moscow had given it said resolutely though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify levin that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done and that she had better undertake it again herself levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevich who by neglecting his duty threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly but he promised his to give the lessons exactly as she wished and he went on teaching grisha not in his own way but by the book and so took little interest in it and often forgot the hour of the lesson so it had been today 
 no going dolly you sit still he said do it all properly according to the book only when stiva comes and we go out shooting then we shall have to miss it 
 and levin went to grisha 
 varenka was saying the same thing to kitty even in the happy household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making herself useful 
 see to the supper you sit still she said and got up to go to agathya mikhailovna 
 yes yes most likely not been able to get chickens if so our 
 agathya mikhailovna and i will see about it and varenka vanished with her 
 what a fine girl said the princess 
 not merely fine maman an exquisite girl no one else like her 
 so you are expecting stepan arkadyevich today said sergei ivanovich evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about varenka it would be difficult to find two more unlike than yours he said with a subtle smile one mobility itself only living in society like a fish in water the other our kostia lively alert quick in everything but as soon as he is in society he either sinks into apathy or struggles helplessly like a fish on land 
 yes very heedless said the princess addressing sergei ivanovich intended indeed to ask you to tell him that out of the question for her she indicated kitty to stay here that she positively must come to moscow he talks of getting a doctor down 
 maman do everything he has agreed to everything kitty said angry with her mother for appealing to sergei ivanovich to judge in such a matter 
 in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel 
 dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband when from the window of the room below where grisha was having his lesson levin leaped out and helped grisha out after him 
 stiva levin shouted from under the balcony finished dolly be afraid he added and started running like a boy to meet the carriage 
 is ea id ejus ejus ejus shouted grisha skipping along the avenue 
 and someone else too papa of course cried levin stopping at the entrance of the avenue kitty come down the steep staircase go around 
 but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside stepan arkadyevich not the prince but a handsome stout young man in a scotch cap with long ends of ribbon behind this was vassenka veslovsky a distant cousin of the shcherbatskys a brilliant young gentleman in peterburg and moscow society a capital fellow and a keen sportsman as stepan arkadyevich said introducing him 
 not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince veslovsky greeted levin gaily claiming acquaintance with him in the past and snatching up grisha into the carriage lifted him over the pointer that stepan arkadyevich had brought with him 
 levin did not get into the carriage but walked behind he was rather vexed at the nonarrival of the old prince whom he liked more and more the more he saw him and also the arrival of this vassenka veslovsky a quite alien and superfluous person he seemed to him still more alien and superfluous when on approaching the steps where the whole party children and grownups were gathered together in much animation levin saw vassenka veslovsky with a particularly warm and gallant air kissing hand 
 your wife and i are cousins and very old friends said vassenka veslovsky once more shaking hand with great warmth 
 well are there plenty of birds stepan arkadyevich said to levin hardly leaving time for everyone to exchange greetings come with the most savage intentions why maman not been in moscow since look tania something for you get it please in the carriage behind he talked in all directions how pretty grown dollenka he said to his wife once more kissing her hand holding it in one of his and patting it with the other 
 levin who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind now looked darkly at everyone and everything displeased him 
 who was it he kissed yesterday with these lips he thought looking at stepan tender demonstrations to his wife he looked at dolly and he did not like her either 
 she believe in his love so what is she pleased about revolting thought levin 
 he looked at the princess who had been so dear to him a minute before and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this vassenka with his ribbons just as though she were in her own house 
 even sergei ivanovich who had come out too on the steps seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met stepan arkadyevich though levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected oblonsky 
 and varenka even she seemed hateful with her air sainte nitouche making the acquaintance of this gentleman while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married 
 and more hateful than anyone was kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else and more unpleasant than everything else was that peculiar smile with which she responded to his smile 
 noisily talking they all went into the house but as soon as they were all seated levin turned and went out 
 kitty saw something was wrong with her husband she tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone but he made haste to get away from her saying he was wanted at the countinghouse it was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment all holiday for them he thought but these are no holiday matters they wait and no living without them

 chapter 
 
 levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon to supper on the stairs were standing kitty and agathya mikhailovna consulting about wines for supper 
 but why are you making all this fuss have what we usually do 
 no stiva drink kostia stop the matter kitty began hurrying after him but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich 
 well what do you say are we going shooting tomorrow said stepan arkadyevich 
 please do go said veslovsky moving to another chair where he sat down sideways with one fat leg crossed under him 
 i shall be delighted we will go and have you had any shooting yet this year said levin to veslovsky looking intently at his leg but speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him and that was so out of keeping with him i answer for our finding double snipe but there are plenty of jacksnipe only we ought to start early not tired you tired stiva 
 me tired never been tired yet suppose we stay up all night go for a walk 
 yes really not go to bed at all capital veslovsky chimed in 
 oh we all know you can do without sleep and keep other people up too dolly said to her husband with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband but to my thinking time for bed now going i want supper 
 no do stay a little dollenka said stepan arkadyevich going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper so much still to tell you 
 nothing really i suppose 
 do you know veslovsky has been at and going to them again you know hardly seventy verstas from you and i too must certainly go over there veslovsky come here 
 vassenka crossed over to the ladies and sat down beside kitty 
 ah do tell me please you have visited her how was she darya alexandrovna appealed to him 
 levin was left at the other end of the table and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and varenka he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan arkadyevich dolly kitty and veslovsky and that was not all he saw on his face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of vassenka who was telling them something with great animation 
 exceedingly nice at their place veslovsky was telling them about vronsky and anna i of course take it upon myself to judge but in their house you feel the real feeling of home 
 what do they intend doing 
 i believe they think of going to moscow for the winter 
 how jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together when are you going there stepan arkadyevich asked vassenka 
 spending july there 
 will you go stepan arkadyevich said to his wife 
 been wanting to a long while i shall certainly go said dolly i am sorry for her and i know her a splendid woman i will go alone when you go back and then i shall be in no way and it will be better indeed without you 
 to be sure said stepan arkadyevich and you kitty 
 i why should i go kitty said flushing all over and she glanced round at her husband 
 do you know anna arkadyevna then veslovsky asked her a very fascinating woman 
 yes she answered veslovsky crimsoning still more she got up and walked across to her husband 
 are you going shooting then tomorrow she said 
 his jealousy had in these few moments especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky gone far indeed now as he heard her words he construed them in his own fashion strange as it was to him afterward to recall it it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky with whom as he fancied she was in love 
 yes going he answered her in an unnatural voice disagreeable to himself 
 no better spend the day here tomorrow or dolly see anything of her husband and set off the day after said kitty 
 the motive of words was interpreted by levin thus separate me from him i care about your going but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man 
 oh if you wish stay here tomorrow levin answered with peculiar amiability 
 vassenka meanwhile utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned got up from the table after kitty and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes he followed her 
 levin saw that look he turned white and for a minute he could hardly breathe how dare he look at my wife like that was the feeling that boiled within him 
 tomorrow then do please let us go said vassenka sitting down on a chair and again crossing his leg as his habit was 
 jealousy went further still already he saw himself a deceived husband looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life but in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about his shooting his gun and his boots and agreed to go shooting next day 
 happily for levin the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising kitty to go to bed but even at this point levin could not escape another agony as he said good night to his hostess vassenka would again have kissed her hand but kitty reddening drew back her hand and said with a bluntness for which the old princess scolded her afterward 
 we like that fashion 
 in eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them 
 why how can one want to go to bed said stepan arkadyevich who after drinking several glasses of wine at supper was now in his most charming and lyrical humor look kitty he said pointing to the moon which had just risen behind the linden trees how exquisite veslovsky this is the time for a serenade you know he has a splendid voice we practised songs together along the road he has brought some lovely songs with him two new ones varvara andreevna and he must sing some duets 
 when the party had broken up stepan arkadyevich walked a long while about the avenue with veslovsky their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs 
 levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his bedroom and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky it all burst out and he told her all he was hurt himself by what he was saying and that exasperated him all the more 
 he stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in the expression of his face would have been grim and even cruel if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her his jaws were twitching and his voice kept breaking 
 you must understand that not jealous a nasty word i be jealous and believe that i say what i feel but this is awful not jealous but wounded humiliated that anybody dare think that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that 
 eyes like what said kitty trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them 
 at the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table but she dared not own it even to herself and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him and so increase his suffering 
 and what can there possibly be attractive about me as i am now 
 ah he cried clutching at his head you say that if you had been attractive then 
 oh no kostia oh wait a minute oh do listen she said looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration why what can you be thinking about when for me no one in the world no one no one would you like me never to see anyone 
 for the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy she was angry that the slightest amusement even the most innocent should be forbidden her but now she would readily have sacrificed not merely such trifles but everything for his peace of mind to save him from the agony he was suffering 
 you must understand the horror and comedy of my position he went on in a desperate whisper that in my house that done nothing positively improper one can take exception only to his free and easy airs and the way he tucks his legs in under him he thinks the best possible form and so obliged to be civil to him 
 but kostia exaggerating said kitty at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her shown now in his jealousy 
 the most awful part of it all is that just as you always are and especially now when to me something sacred and so happy so particularly happy and all of a sudden a little wretch not a little wretch why should i abuse him i have nothing to do with him but why should my and your happiness 
 do you know i understand now what it all came from kitty was beginning 
 well what what 
 i saw how you looked while we were talking at supper 
 well well levin said in dismay 
 she told him what they had been talking about and as she told him she was breathless with emotion levin was silent for a space then he scanned her pale and distressed face and suddenly he clutched at his head 
 katia been worrying you darling forgive me madness katia a criminal and how could you be so distressed at such idiocy 
 oh i was sorry for you 
 for me for me how mad i am but why make you miserable awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness 
 humiliating too of course 
 oh then keep him here all the summer and will overwhelm him with civility said levin kissing her hands you shall see tomorrow oh yes we are going tomorrow

 for the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy she was angry that the slightest amusement even the most innocent should be forbidden her but now she would readily have sacrificed not merely such trifles but everything for his peace of mind to save him from the agony he was suffering 
 you must understand the horror and comedy of my position he went on in a desperate whisper that in my house that done nothing positively improper one can take exception only to his free and easy airs and the way he tucks his legs in under him he thinks the best possible form and so obliged to be civil to him 
 but kostia exaggerating said kitty at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her shown now in his jealousy 
 the most awful part of it all is that just as you always are and especially now when to me something sacred and so happy so particularly happy and all of a sudden a little wretch not a little wretch why should i abuse him i have nothing to do with him but why should my and your happiness 
 do you know i understand now what it all came from kitty was beginning 
 well what what 
 i saw how you looked while we were talking at supper 
 well well levin said in dismay 
 she told him what they had been talking about and as she told him she was breathless with emotion levin was silent for a space then he scanned her pale and distressed face and suddenly he clutched at his head 
 katia been worrying you darling forgive me madness katia a criminal and how could you be so distressed at such idiocy 
 oh i was sorry for you 
 for me for me how mad i am but why make you miserable awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness 
 humiliating too of course 
 oh then keep him here all the summer and will overwhelm him with civility said levin kissing her hands you shall see tomorrow oh yes we are going tomorrow

 next day before the ladies were up the carriages for the shooting party the droshky and a trap were at the door and laska aware since early morning that they were going shooting after much whining and darting to and fro had sat herself down in the droshky beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not issue the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky in new high boots that reached halfway up his thick thighs in a green blouse with a new cartridge belt redolent of leather and in his scotch cap with ribbons with a english gun without a sling laska flew up to him welcomed him and jumping up asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon but getting no answer from him she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again her head on one side and one ear pricked up to listen at last the door opened with a creak and stepan pointer krak flew out running round and round and turning over in the air stepan arkadyevich himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth soho soho krak he cried encouragingly to the dog who put his paws up on his chest catching at his gamebag stepan arkadyevich was dressed in brogues and puttees in torn trousers and a short coat on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem and his gamebag and cartridge belt though worn were of the very best quality 
 vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevich radiant in his rags graceful and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same getup 
 well and what about our host he asked 
 a young wife said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes and such a charming one 
 he came down dressed no doubt run up to her again 
 stepan arkadyevich guessed right levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg her in name to be more careful the great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute jostle against her then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days and to beg her to be sure to send a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write him if it were but two words only to let him know that all was well with her 
 kitty was distressed as she always was at parting for a couple of days from her husband but when she saw his eager figure looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and said to him cheerfully 
 pardon gentlemen he said running out on the steps have you put the lunch in why is the chestnut on the right well it matter laska down go and lie down 
 put them with the herd of heifers he said to the herdsman who was waiting for him at the steps to ask him what was to be done with the geld oxen excuse me here comes another villain 
 levin jumped out of the droshky in which he had already taken his seat to meet the carpenter who came toward the steps with a rule in his hand 
 you come to the countinghouse yesterday and now detaining me well what is it 
 would your honor let me make another turning only three steps to add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more convenient 
 you should have listened to me levin answered with annoyance i said put the lines and then fit in the steps now no setting it right do as i told you and make a new staircase 
 the point was that in the wing that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place now the carpenter wanted to keep the same staircase by adding three steps 
 it will be much better 
 but your staircase coming out with its three steps 
 why upon my word sir the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile it comes out right at the very spot it starts here he said with a persuasive gesture then go up and go up and come out 
 but three steps will add to the length too where is it to come out 
 why to be sure go up and come out the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly 
 reach the ceiling and the wall 
 upon my word why go up and go up and come out like this 
 levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust 
 there do you see 
 as your honor likes said the carpenter with a sudden gleam in his eyes obviously understanding the thing at last it seems be best to make a new one 
 well then do it as told levin shouted seating himself in the droshky down hold the dogs philip 
 levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk besides that he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action if he had anything on his mind at that moment it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak and whether he would shoot well that day himself not to disgrace himself before a new spectator not to be outdone by oblonsky that too was a thought that crossed his brain 
 oblonsky was feeling the same and he too was not talkative vassenka veslovsky alone kept up a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter as he listened to him now levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before vassenka was really a fine fellow simple goodhearted and very if levin had met him before he was married he would have made friends with him levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance it was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed because he had long nails and a stylish cap and everything else to correspond but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding levin liked him for his good education for speaking french and english with such an excellent accent and for being a man of his world 
 vassenka was extremely delighted with the left outrigger a horse of the don steppes he kept praising him enthusiastically how fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse eh it he said he had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic and it turned out nothing of the sort but his simplicity particularly in conjunction with his good looks his amiable smile and the grace of his movements was very attractive either because his nature was sympathetic to levin or because levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him at any rate he liked his society 
 after they had driven three verstas from home veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table in the pocketbook there were three hundred and seventy roubles and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty 
 do you know what levin gallop home on that outrigger that will be splendid eh he said preparing to get out 
 no why should you answered levin calculating that vassenka could hardly weigh less than six poods send the coachman 
 the coachman rode back on the outrigger and levin himself drove the remaining pair

 well now our plan of campaign tell us all about it said stepan arkadyevich 
 our plan is this now driving to gvozdiov in gvozdiov a double snipe marsh on this side and beyond gvozdiov come some magnificent jacksnipe marshes where there are double snipe too hot now and get there twenty verstas toward evening and have some evening shooting spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors 
 and is there nothing on the way 
 yes but save ourselves besides hot there are two good little places but i doubt there being anything to shoot 
 levin would himself have liked to go into these little places but they were near home he could shoot them over any time and they were only little places there would hardly be room for three to shoot and so with some insincerity he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot when they reached a little marsh levin would have driven by but stepan arkadyevich with the experienced eye of a sportsman at once detected a soggy spot visible from the road 
 we try that he said pointing to the little marsh 
 levin do please how delightful vassenka veslovsky began begging and levin could not but consent 
 before they had time to stop the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh 
 krak laska 
 the dogs came back 
 there be room for three stay here said levin hoping they would find nothing but pewits which had been startled by the dogs and turning over in their flight were plaintively wailing over the marsh 
 no come along levin go together veslovsky called 
 really no room laska back laska you want another dog will you 
 levin remained with the droshky and looked enviously at the sportsmen they walked across the marsh except one moor hen and pewits of which vassenka killed one there was nothing in the marsh 
 come you see now that it was not that i grudged the marsh said levin only wasting time 
 oh no it was jolly all the same did you see us said vassenka veslovsky clambering awkwardly into the droshky with his gun and his pewit in his hands how splendidly i shot this bird i well shall we soon be getting to the real place 
 the horses started off suddenly levin knocked his head against the stock of gun and there was the report of a shot the gun did actually go off first but that was how it seemed to levin it appeared that vassenka veslovsky making the cocks safe had pressed one trigger and had held back the other cock the charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone stepan arkadyevich shook his head and laughed reprovingly at veslovsky but levin had not the heart to reprove him in the first place any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on forehead and besides veslovsky was at first so distressed and then laughed so and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with him 
 when they reached the second marsh which was fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin tried to persuade them to pass it by but veslovsky again talked him over again as the marsh was narrow levin like a good host remained with the carriages 
 krak made straight for hummocks vassenka veslovsky was the first to run after the dog before stepan arkadyevich had time to come up a double snipe flew out veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow this double snipe was left for veslovsky to follow up krak found it again and pointed and veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriages 
 now you go and stay with the horses he said 
 levin had begun to feel the pangs of a envy he handed the reins to veslovsky and walked into the marsh 
 laska who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment flew straight ahead to an unfailing place covered with mossy hummocks that levin knew well and that krak had not yet come upon 
 why you stop her shouted stepan arkadyevich 
 she scare them answered levin sympathizing with his pleasure and hurrying after her 
 as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar hummocks there was more and more earnestness in exploration a little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant she made one circuit round the hummocks was beginning a second and suddenly quivered with excitement and stood 
 come come stiva shouted levin feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears all sounds confused but loud began to beat on his hearing losing all sense of distance he heard the steps of stepan arkadyevich mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance he heard the brittle sound of the tussock which came off with its roots when he had trodden on a hummock and he took this sound for the flight of a double snipe he heard too not far behind him a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself 
 picking his steps he moved up to the dog 
 fetch it 
 not a double but a jacksnipe flew up from beside the dog levin had lifted his gun but at the very instant when he was taking aim the sound of splashing grew louder came closer and was joined with the sound of voice shouting something with strange loudness levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe but still he fired 
 when he had made sure he had missed levin looked round and saw the horses and the droshky not on the road but in the marsh 
 veslovsky eager to see the shooting had driven into the marsh and got the horses stuck in the mud 
 damn the fellow levin said to himself as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire what did you drive in for he said to him dryly and calling the coachman he began pulling the horses out 
 levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevich nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing without answering a syllable to protestations that it had been quite dry there levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses but then as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the droshky by one of the splashboards so that he broke it indeed levin blamed himself for having under the influence of feelings been too cold to veslovsky and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything had been put right and the vehicles had been brought back to the road levin had the lunch served 
 bon apptit bonne conscience ce poulet va tomber fond de mes bottes vassenka who had recovered his spirits quoted the french saying as he finished his second chicken well now our troubles are over now going to go well only to atone for my sins bound to sit on the box so eh no no be your automedon you shall see how get you along he answered without letting go the rein when levin begged him to let the coachman drive no i must atone for my sins and very comfortable on the box and he drove 
 levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses especially the left of them the chestnut whom he did not know how to hold in but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the english fashion and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the gvozdiov marsh

 chapter 
 
 vassenka drove the horses so fast that they reached the marsh too early while it was still hot 
 as they drew near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements stepan arkadyevich evidently had the same desire and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting together with a certain slyness peculiar to him 
 how shall we go a splendid marsh i see and there are hawks said stepan arkadyevich pointing to two great birds hovering over the sedge where there are hawks there is sure to be game 
 now gentlemen said levin pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with a somewhat somber expression do you see that sedge he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river the marsh begins here straight in front of us do you see where it is greener from here it runs to the right where the horses are there are hummocks there and double snipe and all round that sedge as far as that alder tree and right up to the mill over there do you see where the creek is the best place there i once shot seventeen jacksnipe separate with the dogs and go in different directions and then meet over there at the mill 
 well go left and who to the right asked stepan arkadyevich wider to the right you two go that way and take the left he said with apparent carelessness 
 capital make the bigger bag yes come along come along vassenka exclaimed 
 levin could do nothing but agree and they divided 
 as soon as they entered the marsh the two dogs began hunting about together and made toward the spot levin knew method wary and indefinite he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe 
 veslovsky walk beside me beside me he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh 
 oh i get in your way trouble about me 
 but levin could not help troubling and recalled words at parting mind you shoot one another the dogs came nearer and nearer passed each other each pursuing its own scent the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the smacking sound of his own heel as he drew it up out of the rusty mire seemed to be the call of a snipe and he clutched and pressed the butt of his gun 
 bang bang sounded almost in his ear vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment toward the sportsmen far out of range before levin had time to look round there was the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rose one after another 
 stepan arkadyevich hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements and the snipe fell as a clod into the quagmire oblonsky aimed deliberately at another still flying low toward the sedge and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut its unhurt wing showing white beneath 
 levin was not so lucky he aimed at his first bird too low and missed he aimed at it again just as it was rising but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet distracting him so that he missed again 
 while they were reloading their guns another snipe rose and veslovsky who had had time to reload again sent two charges of small shot into the water stepan arkadyevich picked up his snipe and with sparkling eyes looked at levin 
 well now let us separate said stepan arkadyevich and limping on his left foot holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog he walked off in one direction levin and veslovsky walked off in the other 
 it always happened with levin that when his first shots were a failure he got heated and out of temper and shot badly the whole day so was it that day the snipe showed themselves in numbers they kept flying up from just under the dogs from under the legs and levin might have retrieved his ill luck but the more he shot the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of veslovsky who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately killing nothing and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself got more and more out of temper and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting laska indeed seemed to understand this she began searching more listlessly and gazed back at the sportsmen with apparent perplexity or reproach in her eyes shots followed shots in rapid succession the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen while in the great roomy net of the gamebag there were only three light small snipe and of these one had been killed by veslovsky alone and one by both of them together meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan shots not frequent but as levin fancied well directed for almost after each they heard krak krak apporte 
 this excited levin still more the snipe were floating continually in the air over the sedge their whirring wings close to the earth and their harsh cries high in the air could be heard on all sides the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air settled again before the sportsmen instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh 
 after walking through the larger half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the sedge marked off in one place by the trampled grass in another by a path mown through it half of these strips had already been mown 
 though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part levin had promised stepan arkadyevich to meet him and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches 
 hi hunters shouted one of a group of peasants sitting on an unharnessed telega come and have some lunch with us have a drop of wine 
 levin looked round 
 come along all right shouted a bearded peasant with a red face showing his white teeth in a grin and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight 
 disent asked veslovsky 
 they invite you to have some vodka most likely been dividing the meadow into lots i should have some said levin not without some guile hoping veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka and would go off to them 
 why do they offer it 
 oh merrymaking really you should join them you would be interested 
 allons curieux 
 you go you go find the way to the mill cried levin and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that veslovsky bent and stumbling with weariness holding his gun out at length was making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants 
 you come too the peasant shouted to levin never fear taste our pie 
 levin felt a strong inclination for a drink of vodka and a bite of bread he was exhausted and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire and for a minute he hesitated but laska was pointing and immediately all his weariness vanished and he walked lightly through the swamp toward the dog a snipe flew up at his feet he fired and killed it laska still pointed fetch it another bird flew up close to the dog levin fired but it was an unlucky day for him he missed it and when he went to look for the one he had shot he could not find that either he wandered all about the sedge but laska did not believe he had shot it and when he sent her to find it she pretended to hunt for it but did not really do so 
 and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin threw the blame of his failure things went no better there was plenty of snipe still but levin made one miss after another 
 the slanting rays of the sun were still hot his clothes soaked through with perspiration stuck to his body his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squelched at every step the sweat ran in drops down his face his mouth was full of a bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the barrel of his gun it was so hot his heart beat with short rapid throbs his hands shook with excitement and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hummocks and in the swamp but still he walked on and still he shot at last after a disgraceful miss he flung his gun and his hat on the ground 
 no i must control myself he said to himself picking up his gun and his hat he called laska and went out of the swamp when he got onto dry ground he sat down on a hummock pulled off his boot and emptied it then walked to the marsh drank some water moistened the burning hot barrel of his gun and washed his face and hands feeling refreshed he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled firmly resolved to keep cool 
 he tried to be calm but it was the same again his finger pressed the trigger before he had taken a good aim at the bird it got worse and worse 
 he had only five birds in his gamebag when he walked out of the marsh toward the alders where he was to rejoin stepan arkadyevich 
 before he caught sight of stepan arkadyevich he saw his dog krak black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder and with the air of a conqueror sniffed laska behind krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevich he came to meet him red and perspiring with unbuttoned neckband still limping in the same way 
 well you have been popping away he said smiling 
 how have you got on queried levin but there was no need to ask for he had already seen the full gamebag 
 oh pretty fair 
 he had fourteen birds 
 a splendid marsh no doubt veslovsky got in your way awkward too shooting with one dog said stepan arkadyevich to soften his triumph

 vassenka drove the horses so fast that they reached the marsh too early while it was still hot 
 as they drew near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements stepan arkadyevich evidently had the same desire and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting together with a certain slyness peculiar to him 
 how shall we go a splendid marsh i see and there are hawks said stepan arkadyevich pointing to two great birds hovering over the sedge where there are hawks there is sure to be game 
 now gentlemen said levin pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with a somewhat somber expression do you see that sedge he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river the marsh begins here straight in front of us do you see where it is greener from here it runs to the right where the horses are there are hummocks there and double snipe and all round that sedge as far as that alder tree and right up to the mill over there do you see where the creek is the best place there i once shot seventeen jacksnipe separate with the dogs and go in different directions and then meet over there at the mill 
 well go left and who to the right asked stepan arkadyevich wider to the right you two go that way and take the left he said with apparent carelessness 
 capital make the bigger bag yes come along come along vassenka exclaimed 
 levin could do nothing but agree and they divided 
 as soon as they entered the marsh the two dogs began hunting about together and made toward the spot levin knew method wary and indefinite he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe 
 veslovsky walk beside me beside me he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh 
 oh i get in your way trouble about me 
 but levin could not help troubling and recalled words at parting mind you shoot one another the dogs came nearer and nearer passed each other each pursuing its own scent the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the smacking sound of his own heel as he drew it up out of the rusty mire seemed to be the call of a snipe and he clutched and pressed the butt of his gun 
 bang bang sounded almost in his ear vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment toward the sportsmen far out of range before levin had time to look round there was the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rose one after another 
 stepan arkadyevich hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements and the snipe fell as a clod into the quagmire oblonsky aimed deliberately at another still flying low toward the sedge and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut its unhurt wing showing white beneath

 chapter 
 
 when levin and stepan arkadyevich reached the hut where levin always used to stay veslovsky was already there he was sitting in the middle of the hut clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier the brother of the wife who was helping him off with his miry boots veslovsky was laughing his infectious laugh 
 only just come ils ont t charmants just fancy they gave me drink and fed me such bread it was exquisite dlicieux and the vodka i never tasted any better and they would not take a penny for anything and they kept saying excuse our homely ways 
 what should they take anything for they were entertaining you to be sure do you suppose they keep vodka for sale said the soldier succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off together with the blackened stocking 
 in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean and the smells of the marsh and the powder that filled the room and the absence of knives and forks the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen washed and clean they went into a hay barn swept ready for them where the coachmen had been making up beds for the gentlemen 
 though it was dusk not one of them wanted to go to sleep 
 after wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns of dogs and of former shooting parties the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them after vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken telega he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out of the good nature of the peasants who had treated him to vodka of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at where he had stayed the previous summer malthus was a capitalist who had made his money by speculation in railway shares stepan arkadyevich described what snipe moors this malthus had taken on lease in the tver province and how they were preserved and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh 
 i understand you said levin sitting up in the hay how is it such people disgust you i can understand a lunch with lafitte is all very pleasant but you dislike just that very sumptuousness all these people just like our tax farmers in the old days get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone they care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved 
 perfectly true chimed in vassenka veslovsky perfectly oblonsky of course goes out of bonhomie but other people say well oblonsky stays with them 
 not a bit of it levin could hear that oblonsky was smiling as he spoke i simply consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence 
 oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them 
 of course work work in this sense that if it were not for him and others like him there would have been no railways 
 but not work like the work of a peasant or in a learned profession 
 granted but work in the sense that his activity produces a result the railways but of course you think the railways useless 
 no another question i am disposed to admit that useful but all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest 
 but who is to define what is proportionate 
 making profit by dishonest means by trickery said levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty such as banking for instance he went on an evil the amassing of huge fortunes without labor just the same thing as with the tax farmers only the form changed le roi est mort vive le roi no sooner were the tax farmers abolished than the railways came up and banking companies that too is profit without work 
 yes that may all be very true and clever lie down krak stepan arkadyevich called to his dog who was scratching and turning over all the hay he was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position and so talked serenely and without haste but you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work that i receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk though he knows more about the work than i do dishonest i suppose 
 i say 
 well but i can tell you your receiving some five thousand say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he works can never get more than fifty roubles is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk and malthus getting more than a railway expert no quite the contrary i see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which is utterly baseless and i fancy envy at the bottom of it 
 no unfair said veslovsky how could envy come in there is something unclean about that sort of business 
 you say levin went on that unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant has fifty roubles true it is unfair and i feel it but 
 it really is why is it we spend our time riding drinking shooting doing nothing while they are forever at work said vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity 
 yes you feel it but you give him your property said stepan arkadyevich intentionally as it seemed provoking levin 
 there had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two as though since they had married sisters a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation as it began to take a personal note 
 i give it away because no one demands that from me and if i wanted to i could not give it away answered levin and have no one to give it to 
 give it to this peasant he would not refuse it 
 yes but how am i to give it up am i to go to him and make a title deed 
 i know but if you are convinced that you have no right 
 not at all convinced on the contrary i feel have no right to give it up that i have duties both to the land and to my family 
 no excuse me but if you consider this inequality is unjust why is it you act accordingly 
 well i do act negatively on that idea so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me 
 no excuse me a paradox 
 yes something of a sophistry about that veslovsky agreed ah our host he said to the peasant who came into the barn opening the creaking door how is it not asleep yet 
 no one to sleep i thought our gentlemen would be asleep but i heard them chattering i want to get a hook from here she bite he added stepping cautiously with his bare feet 
 and where are you going to sleep 
 we are going out for night watching 
 ah what a night said veslovsky looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed droshky that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors but listen there are voices singing and on my word not badly too that singing my friend 
 the housemaids from hard by here 
 go take a walk we go to sleep you know oblonsky come along 
 if one could only do both lie here and go answered oblonsky stretching capital lying here 
 well i shall go by myself said veslovsky getting up eagerly and putting on his boots and stockings gentlemen if fun fetch you treated me to some good sport and i forget you 
 he really is a capital fellow he said stepan arkadyevich when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him 
 yes capital answered levin still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity and yet both of them straightforward men and not fools had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries this disconcerted him 
 just this my dear boy one must do one of two things either admit that the existing order of society is just and then stick up for rights in it or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges as i do and then enjoy them and be satisfied 
 no if it were unjust you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied at least i could not the great thing for me is to feel that not to blame 
 what do you say why not go after all said stepan arkadyevich evidently weary of the strain of thought we go to sleep you know come go 
 levin did not answer what they had said in the conversation that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts can it be that only possible to be just negatively he was asking himself 
 how strong the smell of the fresh hay is though said stepan arkadyevich getting up not a chance of sleeping vassenka has been getting up some fun there do you hear the laughter and his voice we better go come along 
 no not coming answered levin 
 surely not a matter of principle too said stepan arkadyevich smiling as he felt about in the dark for his cap 
 not a matter of principle but why should i go 
 but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself said stepan arkadyevich finding his cap and getting up 
 how so 
 do you suppose i see the line taken up with your wife i heard how a question of the greatest consequence whether or not to be away for a couple of days shooting all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that answer a man must be independent he has his masculine interests a man has to be manly said oblonsky opening the door 
 in what way to go running after servant girls said levin 
 why not if it amuses him a ne tire pas consequence it do my wife any harm and amuse me the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but tie your own hands 
 perhaps so said levin dryly and he turned on his side tomorrow early i want to go shooting and i wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak 
 messieurs venez vite they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back charmante made such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and already made friends with her really exceedingly pretty he declared in a tone of approval as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account and he were expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him 
 levin pretended to be asleep while oblonsky putting on his slippers and lighting a cigar walked out of the barn and soon their voices were lost 
 for a long while levin could not get to sleep he heard his horses munching hay then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready and then going off for the night watching then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the younger son of their peasant host he heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their guns and then to check the questions he said go to sleep vaska go to sleep or catch it and soon after he began snoring himself and everything was still he could only hear the neigh of the horses and the guttural cry of a snipe is it really only negative he repeated to himself well what of it not my fault and he began thinking about the next day 
 tomorrow go out early and make a point of keeping cool there are lots of snipe and there are double snipe too when i come back be the note from kitty yes stiva may be right not manly with her tied to her apron strings well it be helped negative again 
 half asleep he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich for an instant he opened his eyes the moon was up and in the open doorway brightly lighted up by the moonlight they were standing talking stepan arkadyevich was saying something of the freshness of one girl comparing her to a freshly peeled nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words probably said to him by a peasant ah better get round your own wife levin half asleep said 
 gentlemen tomorrow before daylight and fell asleep

 well i shall go by myself said veslovsky getting up eagerly and putting on his boots and stockings gentlemen if fun fetch you treated me to some good sport and i forget you 
 he really is a capital fellow he said stepan arkadyevich when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him 
 yes capital answered levin still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity and yet both of them straightforward men and not fools had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries this disconcerted him 
 just this my dear boy one must do one of two things either admit that the existing order of society is just and then stick up for rights in it or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges as i do and then enjoy them and be satisfied 
 no if it were unjust you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied at least i could not the great thing for me is to feel that not to blame 
 what do you say why not go after all said stepan arkadyevich evidently weary of the strain of thought we go to sleep you know come go 
 levin did not answer what they had said in the conversation that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts can it be that only possible to be just negatively he was asking himself 
 how strong the smell of the fresh hay is though said stepan arkadyevich getting up not a chance of sleeping vassenka has been getting up some fun there do you hear the laughter and his voice we better go come along 
 no not coming answered levin 
 surely not a matter of principle too said stepan arkadyevich smiling as he felt about in the dark for his cap 
 not a matter of principle but why should i go 
 but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself said stepan arkadyevich finding his cap and getting up 
 how so 
 do you suppose i see the line taken up with your wife i heard how a question of the greatest consequence whether or not to be away for a couple of days shooting all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that answer a man must be independent he has his masculine interests a man has to be manly said oblonsky opening the door 
 in what way to go running after servant girls said levin 
 why not if it amuses him a ne tire pas consequence it do my wife any harm and amuse me the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but tie your own hands 
 perhaps so said levin dryly and he turned on his side tomorrow early i want to go shooting and i wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak 
 messieurs venez vite they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back charmante made such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and already made friends with her really exceedingly pretty he declared in a tone of approval as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account and he were expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him 
 levin pretended to be asleep while oblonsky putting on his slippers and lighting a cigar walked out of the barn and soon their voices were lost 
 for a long while levin could not get to sleep he heard his horses munching hay then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready and then going off for the night watching then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the younger son of their peasant host he heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their guns and then to check the questions he said go to sleep vaska go to sleep or catch it and soon after he began snoring himself and everything was still he could only hear the neigh of the horses and the guttural cry of a snipe is it really only negative he repeated to himself well what of it not my fault and he began thinking about the next day 
 tomorrow go out early and make a point of keeping cool there are lots of snipe and there are double snipe too when i come back be the note from kitty yes stiva may be right not manly with her tied to her apron strings well it be helped negative again 
 half asleep he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich for an instant he opened his eyes the moon was up and in the open doorway brightly lighted up by the moonlight they were standing talking stepan arkadyevich was saying something of the freshness of one girl comparing her to a freshly peeled nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words probably said to him by a peasant ah better get round your own wife levin half asleep said 
 gentlemen tomorrow before daylight and fell asleep

 waking up at earliest dawn levin tried to wake his companions vassenka lying on his stomach with one leg in a stocking thrust out was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response oblonsky half asleep declined to get up so early even laska who was asleep curled up in the hay got up unwillingly and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other getting on his boots taking his gun and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn levin went out into the road the coachmen were sleeping near their carriages the horses were dozing only one was lazily eating oats scattering them in the manger when snorting it was still gray 
 why are you up so early my dear the old woman their hostess said coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend 
 going shooting auntie do i go this way to the marsh 
 straight out at the back by our threshing floor my dear and hemp patches a little footpath 
 stepping carefully with her sunburned bare feet the old woman conducted levin and moved back the gate for him by the threshing floor 
 straight ahead and come to the marsh our lads drove the horses there yesterday evening 
 laska ran eagerly forward along the little path levin followed her with a light rapid step continually looking at the sky he hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh but the sun did not delay the moon which had been bright when he went out by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver the rosy flush of dawn which one could not help seeing before now had to be sought to be discerned at all what before had been undefined vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen they were sheaves of rye the dew not visible till the sun was up wetted legs and his blouse above his belt in the fragrant hemp patch from which the male plants had already been gathered in in the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible a bee flew by ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet he looked carefully and saw a second and a third they were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh the path led straight to the marsh the marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it thicker in one place and thinner in another so that the sedge and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist at the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boys and men who had been herding for the night were lying and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats not far from them were three hobbled horses one of them clanked a chain laska walked beside her master pressing a little forward and looking round passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds levin examined his percussion caps and unleashed his dog one of the horses a sleek seeing the dog started away switched its tail and snorted the other horses too were frightened and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound they bounded out of the marsh laska stopped looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at levin levin patted laska and whistled as a sign that she might begin 
 laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the quagmire that quaked under her 
 running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots marsh plants and dross and the extraneous smell of horse manure laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh the scent of that bird that always excited her more than any other here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter to find the direction she had to get farther away from the wind not feeling the motion of her legs laska bounded with a still gallop so that at each bound she could stop short to the right away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise and turned facing the wind sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils she felt at once that not their traces only but they themselves were here before her not one but many laska slackened her speed they were here but where precisely she could not yet determine to find the very spot she began to make a circle when suddenly her voice drew her off laska here he said pointing her to a different direction she stopped asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun but he repeated his command in an angry voice pointing to a hummock spot covered with water where there could not be anything she obeyed him pretending she was searching so as to please him went round it and went back to her former position and was at once aware of the scent again now when he was not hindering her she knew what to do and without looking at what was under her feet and to her vexation stumbling over a hummock into the water but righting herself with her strong supple legs she began making the circuit which was to make all clear to her the scent of them reached her stronger and stronger and more and more defined and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here behind this hummock five paces in front of her she stopped and her whole body was still and rigid on her short legs she could see nothing in front of her but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off she stood still feeling more and more conscious of it and enjoying it in anticipation her tail was stretched straight and tense and only wagged at the extreme tip her mouth was slightly open her ears raised one ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up and she breathed heavily but warily and still more warily she turned around but more with her eyes than her head to her master he was coming along with the face she knew so well though the eyes were always terrible to her he stumbled over the hummocks as he came and moved as she thought extraordinarily slowly she thought he came slowly but he was running 
 noticing special attitude as she crouched on the ground as it were scratching big prints with her hind paws and with her mouth slightly open levin knew she was pointing at double snipe and with an inward prayer for luck especially with the first bird he ran up to her coming quite close up to her he could from his height look beyond her and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose in a space between two little hummocks at a couple of yards distance he could see a double snipe turning its head it was listening then lightly preening and folding its wings it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail 
 fetch it fetch it shouted levin giving laska a shove from behind 
 but i go thought laska where am i to go from here i feel them but if i move forward i shall know nothing of where they are or who they are but then he shoved her with his knee and in an excited whisper said fetch it lassochka fetch it 
 well if what he wishes do it but i answer for myself now she thought and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the hummocks she scented nothing now she could only see and hear without understanding anything 
 ten paces from her former place a double snipe rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar convex sound of its wings and immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire another bird did not linger but rose behind levin without the offices 
 when levin turned toward it it was already some way off but his shot caught it flying twenty paces farther the second double snipe rose upward and whirling round like a ball dropped heavily on a dry place 
 come this is going to be some good thought levin packing the warm and fat snipe into his gamebag eh laska will it be good 
 when levin after reloading his gun moved on the sun had fully risen though unseen behind clouds the moon had lost all of its luster and was like a white cloud in the sky not a single star could be seen the soggy places silvery with dew before now shone like gold the rusty pools were all like amber the blue of the grass had changed to yellow green the marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows a hawk woke up and settled on a haycock turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh crows were flying about the field and a barelegged boy was driving the horses to an old man who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair the smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass 
 one of the boys ran up to levin 
 uncle there were ducks here yesterday he shouted to him and he walked a little way off behind him 
 and levin was doubly pleased in sight of the boy who expressed his approval at killing three jacksnipe one after another straight off

 the saying that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed the shooting will be lucky turned out correct 
 at ten levin weary hungry and happy after a tramp of thirty verstas returned to his lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck which he tied to his belt as it would not go into the gamebag his companions had long been awake and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast 
 wait a bit wait a bit i know there are nineteen said levin counting a second time over the double snipe and jacksnipe that looked so much less important now bent and dry and bloodstained with heads crookedly to one side than they did when they were flying 
 the number was verified and stepan envy pleased levin he was pleased too on returning to find that the man sent by kitty with a note was already here 
 i am perfectly well and happy if you were uneasy about me you can feel easier than ever a new bodyguard marya vlassyevna this was the midwife a new and important personage in domestic life she has come to have a look at me she found me perfectly well and we are holding her till you are back all are happy and well and please be in a hurry to come back but if the sport is good stay another day 
 these two pleasures his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over levin one was that the chestnut trace horse who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day was off his feed and out of sorts the coachman said the horse was overstrained 
 overdriven yesterday konstantin dmitrievich he said yes indeed driving ten miles without any sense 
 the other unpleasant incident which for the first minute destroyed his good humor though later he laughed at it a great deal was to find that of all the provisions which kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week nothing was left on his way back tired and hungry from shooting levin had so distinct a vision of meat pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them as laska had smelt the game and he immediately told philip to give him some it appeared that there were no pies left nor even any chicken 
 well this appetite said stepan arkadyevich laughing and pointing at vassenka veslovsky i never suffer from loss of appetite but really marvelous 
 well it be helped said levin looking gloomily at veslovsky well philip give me some beef then 
 the been eaten and the bones given to the dogs answered philip 
 levin was so hurt that he said in a tone of vexation you might have left me something and he felt ready to cry 
 then disembowel the game he said in a shaking voice to philip trying not to look at vassenka and cover them with some nettles and you might at least ask for some milk for me 
 but when he had drunk some milk he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification 
 in the evening they went shooting again and veslovsky too had several successful shots and in the night they drove home 
 their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants who had regaled him with vodka and said to him excuse our homely ways and his adventures with tug of war and the servant girl and the peasant who had asked him was he married and on learning that he was not said to him well mind you run after other wives better get round your own these words had particularly amused veslovsky 
 altogether enjoyed our outing awfully and you levin 
 i have very much levin said quite sincerely it was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling toward vassenka veslovsky at home and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him

 chapter 
 
 next day at ten levin who had already gone his rounds knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night 
 entrez veslovsky called to him excuse me only just finished my ablutions he said smiling standing before him in his underclothes only 
 mind me please levin sat down in the window have you slept well 
 like the dead what sort of day is it for shooting 
 what will you take tea or coffee 
 neither wait till lunch really ashamed i suppose the ladies are down a walk now would be capital you show me your horses 
 after walking about the garden visiting the stable and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars levin returned to the house with his guest and went with him into the drawing room 
 we had splendid shooting and so many delightful experiences said veslovsky going up to kitty who was sitting at the samovar what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights 
 well i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house levin said to himself again he fancied something in the smile in the air with which their guest addressed kitty 
 the princess sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlassyevna and stepan arkadyevich called levin to her side and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for confinement and getting ready rooms for them just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth the date of which they reckoned it seemed on their fingers he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious endless strips of knitting the triangles of linen to which dolly attached special importance and so on the birth of a son he was certain it would be a son which was promised him but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it seemed presented itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that did happen to people jarred on him as confusing and humiliating 
 but the princess did not understand his feelings and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she gave him no peace she had commissioned stepan arkadyevich to look at an apartment and now she called levin to her 
 i know nothing about it princess do as you think fit he said 
 you must decide when you will move 
 i really know i know millions of children are born away from moscow and doctors why 
 but if so 
 oh no as kitty wishes 
 we talk to kitty about it do you want me to frighten her why this spring natalie golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor 
 i will do just what you say he said gloomily 
 the princess began talking to him but he did not hear her though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him he was gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he saw at the samovar 
 no impossible he thought glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty telling her something with his charming smile and at her flushed and disturbed 
 there was something unclean in attitude in his eyes in his smile levin even saw something unclean in attitude and look and again the light died away in his eyes again as before all of a sudden without the slightest transition he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation again everything and everyone had become hateful to him 
 you do just as you think best princess he said again looking round 
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown stepan arkadyevich said playfully hinting evidently not simply at the conversation but at the cause of agitation which he had noticed how late you are today dolly 
 everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna vassenka only rose for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bowed and resumed his conversation again laughing at something 
 masha has been almost the end of me she did not sleep well and is dreadfully capricious today said dolly 
 the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening discussing anna and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations kitty disliked the conversation and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted and especially by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband but she was too simple and unsophisticated to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young very obvious admiration she wanted to stop this conversation but she did not know what to do whatever she did she knew it would be observed by her husband and the worst interpretation put on it and in fact when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha and vassenka waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over began to gaze indifferently at dolly the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy 
 what do you say shall we go and look for mushrooms today said dolly 
 by all means please and i shall come too said kitty and she blushed she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she did not ask him where are you going kostia she asked her husband with a guilty face as he passed by her with a resolute step this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions 
 the mechanician came when i was away i seen him yet he said not looking at her 
 he went downstairs but before he had time to leave his study he heard his familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him 
 what do you want he said to her shortly we are busy 
 i beg your pardon she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband 
 the german would have left the room but levin said to him 
 disturb yourself 
 the train is at three queried the german i be late 
 levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife 
 well what have you to say to me he said to her in french 
 he did not look her in the face and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over and had a piteous crushed look 
 i i want to say that we go on like this that this is misery she said 
 the servants are here at the buttery he said angrily make a scene 
 well go in here 
 they were standing in the passage room kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tania a lesson 
 well come into the garden 
 in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path and no longer considering that the peasant could see her and his agitated face that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster they went on with rapid steps feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling 
 we go on like this misery i am wretched you are wretched what for she said when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the linden tree avenue

 next day at ten levin who had already gone his rounds knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night 
 entrez veslovsky called to him excuse me only just finished my ablutions he said smiling standing before him in his underclothes only 
 mind me please levin sat down in the window have you slept well 
 like the dead what sort of day is it for shooting 
 what will you take tea or coffee 
 neither wait till lunch really ashamed i suppose the ladies are down a walk now would be capital you show me your horses 
 after walking about the garden visiting the stable and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars levin returned to the house with his guest and went with him into the drawing room 
 we had splendid shooting and so many delightful experiences said veslovsky going up to kitty who was sitting at the samovar what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights 
 well i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house levin said to himself again he fancied something in the smile in the air with which their guest addressed kitty 
 the princess sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlassyevna and stepan arkadyevich called levin to her side and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for confinement and getting ready rooms for them just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth the date of which they reckoned it seemed on their fingers he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious endless strips of knitting the triangles of linen to which dolly attached special importance and so on the birth of a son he was certain it would be a son which was promised him but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it seemed presented itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that did happen to people jarred on him as confusing and humiliating 
 but the princess did not understand his feelings and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she gave him no peace she had commissioned stepan arkadyevich to look at an apartment and now she called levin to her 
 i know nothing about it princess do as you think fit he said 
 you must decide when you will move 
 i really know i know millions of children are born away from moscow and doctors why 
 but if so 
 oh no as kitty wishes 
 we talk to kitty about it do you want me to frighten her why this spring natalie golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor 
 i will do just what you say he said gloomily 
 the princess began talking to him but he did not hear her though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him he was gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he saw at the samovar 
 no impossible he thought glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty telling her something with his charming smile and at her flushed and disturbed 
 there was something unclean in attitude in his eyes in his smile levin even saw something unclean in attitude and look and again the light died away in his eyes again as before all of a sudden without the slightest transition he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation again everything and everyone had become hateful to him 
 you do just as you think best princess he said again looking round 
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown stepan arkadyevich said playfully hinting evidently not simply at the conversation but at the cause of agitation which he had noticed how late you are today dolly 
 everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna vassenka only rose for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bowed and resumed his conversation again laughing at something 
 masha has been almost the end of me she did not sleep well and is dreadfully capricious today said dolly 
 the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening discussing anna and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations kitty disliked the conversation and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted and especially by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband but she was too simple and unsophisticated to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young very obvious admiration she wanted to stop this conversation but she did not know what to do whatever she did she knew it would be observed by her husband and the worst interpretation put on it and in fact when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha and vassenka waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over began to gaze indifferently at dolly the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy 
 what do you say shall we go and look for mushrooms today said dolly 
 by all means please and i shall come too said kitty and she blushed she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she did not ask him where are you going kostia she asked her husband with a guilty face as he passed by her with a resolute step this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions 
 the mechanician came when i was away i seen him yet he said not looking at her 
 he went downstairs but before he had time to leave his study he heard his familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him 
 what do you want he said to her shortly we are busy 
 i beg your pardon she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband 
 the german would have left the room but levin said to him 
 disturb yourself 
 the train is at three queried the german i be late 
 levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife 
 well what have you to say to me he said to her in french 
 he did not look her in the face and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over and had a piteous crushed look 
 i i want to say that we go on like this that this is misery she said 
 the servants are here at the buttery he said angrily make a scene 
 well go in here 
 they were standing in the passage room kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tania a lesson 
 well come into the garden 
 in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path and no longer considering that the peasant could see her and his agitated face that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster they went on with rapid steps feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling 
 we go on like this misery i am wretched you are wretched what for she said when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the linden tree avenue 
 but tell me one thing was there in his tone anything unseemly unclean humiliatingly horrible he said standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest as he had stood before her that night

 after escorting his wife upstairs levin went to part of the house darya alexandrovna for her part was also in great distress that day she was walking about the room talking angrily to a little girl who stood in the corner bawling 
 and you shall stand all day in the corner and have your dinner all alone and not see one of your dolls and i make you a new frock she said not knowing how to punish her 
 oh she is a disgusting child she turned to levin where does she get such wicked propensities 
 why what has she done levin said without much interest for he had wanted to ask her advice and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment 
 grisha and she went into the raspberries and there i tell you really what she did a thousand pities miss not with us this one sees to nothing a machine que la petite 
 and darya alexandrovna described crime 
 that proves nothing not a question of evil propensities at all simply mischief levin assured her 
 but you are upset about something what have you come for asked dolly going on there 
 and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say 
 not been in there been alone in the garden with kitty had a quarrel for the second time since stiva came 
 dolly looked at him with her shrewd comprehending eyes 
 come tell me honor bright has there been not in kitty but in that behavior a tone which might be unpleasant not unpleasant but horrible offensive to a husband 
 you mean how shall i say stand there stand in the corner she said to masha who detecting a faint smile on her face had been turning round the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave il fait le cour une jeune et jolie femme and a husband a man of the world should only be flattered by it 
 yes yes said levin gloomily but you noticed it 
 not only i but stiva noticed it just after breakfast he said to me je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour kitty 
 well all right then now satisfied send him away said levin 
 what do you mean are you crazy dolly cried in horror nonsense kostia only think she said laughing you can go now to fanny she said to masha no if you wish it speak to stiva take him away he can say expecting visitors altogether he fit into the house 
 no no do it myself 
 but quarrel with him 
 not a bit i shall so enjoy it levin said his eyes flashing with real enjoyment come forgive her dolly she do it again he said of the little sinner who had not gone to fanny but was standing irresolutely before her mother waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her eye 
 the mother glanced at her the child broke into sobs hid her face on her lap and dolly laid her thin tender hand on her head 
 and what is there in common between us and him thought levin and he went off to look for veslovsky 
 as he passed through the hall he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station 
 the spring was broken yesterday said the footman 
 well the tarantass then and make haste the visitor 
 the gone to his room 
 levin came upon vassenka at the moment when the latter having unpacked his things from his trunk and laid out some new songs was putting on his leather gaiters to go out riding 
 whether there was something exceptional in face or that vassenka was himself conscious that le petit brin de cour he was making was out of place in this family he was somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at entrance 
 you ride in gaiters 
 yes much cleaner said vassenka putting his fat leg on a chair fastening the bottom hook and smiling with simplehearted good humor 
 he was undoubtedly a fellow and levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as his host when he saw the shy look on face 
 on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning at gymnastics trying to raise up the swollen bars levin took the fragment in his hands and began breaking off the split end of the stick not knowing how to begin 
 i wanted he paused but suddenly remembering kitty and everything that had happened he said looking him resolutely in the face i have ordered the horses to be put to for you 
 how so vassenka began in surprise to drive where 
 for you to drive to the station levin said gloomily pinching off the end of the stick 
 are you going away or has something happened 
 it happens that i expect visitors said levin his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick and not expecting visitors and nothing has happened but i beg you to go away you can explain my rudeness as you like 
 vassenka drew himself up 
 i beg you to explain he said with dignity understanding at last 
 i explain levin said softly and deliberately trying to control the trembling of his jaw and better not ask 
 and as the split ends were all broken off levin clutched the thick ends in his finger split the stick in two and carefully caught the end as it fell 
 probably the sight of those tense hands of the same muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics of the glittering eyes the soft voice and quivering jaws convinced vassenka better than any words he bowed shrugging his shoulders and smiling contemptuously 
 may i not see oblonsky 
 the shrug and the smile did not irritate levin what else was there for him to do he thought 
 send him to you at once 
 what madness is this stepan arkadyevich said when after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house he found levin in the garden where he was walking about waiting for his departure mais ridicule what flea has bitten you mais du dernier ridicule what did you think if a young man 
 but the place where levin had been bitten was evidently still sore for he turned pale again when stepan arkadyevich would have enlarged on the reason and he himself cut him short 
 please go into it i help it i feel ashamed of the way treating you and him but it be i imagine a great grief to him to go and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife 
 but insulting to him et puis ridicule 
 and to me both insulting and distressing and not in fault in any way and no need for me to suffer 
 well this i expect of you on peut tre jaloux mais ce point du dernier ridicule 
 levin turned quickly and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue and he went on walking up and down alone soon he heard the rumble of the tarantass and saw from behind the trees how vassenka sitting in the hay unluckily there was no seat in the tarantass in his scotch cap was driven along the avenue jolting up and down over the ruts 
 this levin thought when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the tarantass it was the mechanician whom levin had totally forgotten the mechanician bowing low said something to veslovsky then clambered into the tarantass and they drove off together 
 stepan arkadyevich and the princess were much upset by action and he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through when he asked himself how he should act another time he answered that he would do precisely the same 
 in spite of all this toward the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon action became extraordinarily lively and like children after a punishment or people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening dismissal was spoken of in the absence of the princess as though it were some remote event and dolly who had inherited her gift of humorous storytelling made varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous additions how she had just put on her new ribands for the benefit of the visitor and on going into the drawing room had suddenly heard the rumble of the chariot and who should be in the chariot but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his songs and his gaiters and all sitting in the hay 
 if only ordered out the carriage but no and then i hear stop oh i thought relented i look out and a fat german is being sat down by him and driving away and my new ribands all for nothing

 chapter 
 
 darya alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see anna she was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin disliked she quite understood how right the levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with vronsky but she felt she must go and see anna and show her that her feelings could not be changed in spite of the change in her position 
 that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition darya alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive but levin learning of it went to her to protest 
 what makes you suppose that i dislike your going but even if did dislike it i should still more dislike your not taking my horses he said you never told me that you were going definitely hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me and of more importance undertake the job and never get you there i have horses and if you want to wound me take mine 
 darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the day fixed levin had ready for his a set of four horses and relays getting them together from the farm and saddle horses not at all a set but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horses were wanted for the princess who was going and for the midwife it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house moreover he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her darya pecuniary affairs which were in a very unsatisfactory state were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own 
 darya alexandrovna by advice started before daybreak the road was good the carriage comfortable the horses trotted along merrily and on the box beside the coachman sat the countinghouse clerk whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed 
 after drinking tea at the same with whom levin had stayed on the way to and chatting with the women about their children and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praised very highly darya alexandrovna at ten went on again at home looking after her children she had no time to think so now after this journey of four hours all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain and she thought over all her life as she never had before and from the most different points of view her thoughts seemed strange even to herself at first she thought about the children about whom she was uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckoned more upon her had promised to look after them if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks if grisha kicked by a horse and stomach upset again but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter to renew the furniture and to make her elder girl a cloak then questions of the more remote future occurred to her how she was to place her children in the world the girls are all right she thought but the boys 
 all very fine for me to be teaching grisha but of course only because i am free myself now not with child stiva of course no counting on and with the help of friends i can bring them up but if another baby coming and the thought struck her how unjustly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children the birth itself nothing but the months of carrying the child so intolerable she thought picturing to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn on being asked whether she had any children the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully 
 i had a girl baby but god set me free i buried her last lent 
 well did you grieve very much for her asked darya alexandrovna 
 why grieve the old man has grandchildren enough as it is it was only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie 
 this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recalling these words in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth 
 yes in general thought darya alexandrovna looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all hideousness kitty young and pretty as she is even kitty has lost her looks and i when with child become hideous i know it the birth the agony the hideous agonies that last moment then the nursing the sleepless nights the fearful pains 
 darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child then the illnesses that everlasting apprehension then bringing them up evil propensities she thought of little crime among the raspberries education latin all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these children and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tore her heart of the death of her last little baby who had died of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with the curls falling on temples and the open wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a gallooned cross on it 
 and all this it for what is to come of it all this wasting my life never having a peace either with child or nursing a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worrying others repulsive to my husband while the children are growing up unhappy badly educated and penniless even now if it for spending the summer at the levins i know how we should be managing to live of course kostia and kitty have so much tact that we feel it but it go on have children they be able to keep us a drag on them as it is how is papa who has hardly anything left for himself to help us so that i even bring the children up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation why even if we suppose the greatest good luck that the children die and i bring them up somehow at the very best simply be decent people all i can hope for and to gain simply that what agonies what toil whole life ruined again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said and again she was revolted at the thought but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words 
 is it far now mikhaila darya alexandrovna asked the countinghouse clerk to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her 
 from this village they say seven verstas 
 the carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge on the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders cheerfully chattering they stood still on the bridge staring inquisitively at the carriage all the faces turned to darya alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy making her envious of their enjoyment of life all living all enjoying life darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage while i let out as it were from prison from the world of worries that fret me to death am only looking about me now for an instant they all live those peasant women and my sister natalie and varenka and anna whom i am going to see all but not i 
 and they attack anna what for am i any better i have at any rate a husband i love not as i should like to love him still i do love him while anna never loved hers how is she to blame she wants to live god has put that in our hearts very likely i should have done the same even to this day i feel sure i did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in moscow i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life anew i might have loved and have been loved in reality and is it any better as it is i respect him necessary to me she thought about her husband and i put up with him is that any better at that time i could still have been admired i had beauty left me still darya alexandrovna pursued her thoughts and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag and she wanted to take it out but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying countinghouse clerk she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round and she did not take out the glass 
 but without looking in the glass she thought that even now it was not too late and she thought of sergei ivanovich who was always particularly attentive to her of goodhearted friend turovtsin who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina and was in love with her and there was someone else quite a young man who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters and the most passionate and impossible romances rose before darya imagination anna did quite right and certainly i shall never reproach her for it she is happy she makes another person happy and not broken down as i am but most likely just as she always was bright clever open to every impression thought darya alexandrovna and a sly smile curved her lips for as she pondered on love affair darya alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who was in love with her she like anna confessed the whole affair to her husband and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevich at this avowal made her smile 
 in such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to vozdivzhenskoe

 darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the day fixed levin had ready for his a set of four horses and relays getting them together from the farm and saddle horses not at all a set but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horses were wanted for the princess who was going and for the midwife it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house moreover he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her darya pecuniary affairs which were in a very unsatisfactory state were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own 
 darya alexandrovna by advice started before daybreak the road was good the carriage comfortable the horses trotted along merrily and on the box beside the coachman sat the countinghouse clerk whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed 
 after drinking tea at the same with whom levin had stayed on the way to and chatting with the women about their children and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praised very highly darya alexandrovna at ten went on again at home looking after her children she had no time to think so now after this journey of four hours all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain and she thought over all her life as she never had before and from the most different points of view her thoughts seemed strange even to herself at first she thought about the children about whom she was uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckoned more upon her had promised to look after them if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks if grisha kicked by a horse and stomach upset again but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter to renew the furniture and to make her elder girl a cloak then questions of the more remote future occurred to her how she was to place her children in the world the girls are all right she thought but the boys 
 all very fine for me to be teaching grisha but of course only because i am free myself now not with child stiva of course no counting on and with the help of friends i can bring them up but if another baby coming and the thought struck her how unjustly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children the birth itself nothing but the months of carrying the child so intolerable she thought picturing to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn on being asked whether she had any children the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully 
 i had a girl baby but god set me free i buried her last lent 
 well did you grieve very much for her asked darya alexandrovna 
 why grieve the old man has grandchildren enough as it is it was only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie 
 this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recalling these words in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth 
 yes in general thought darya alexandrovna looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all hideousness kitty young and pretty as she is even kitty has lost her looks and i when with child become hideous i know it the birth the agony the hideous agonies that last moment then the nursing the sleepless nights the fearful pains 
 darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child then the illnesses that everlasting apprehension then bringing them up evil propensities she thought of little crime among the raspberries education latin all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these children and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tore her heart of the death of her last little baby who had died of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with the curls falling on temples and the open wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a gallooned cross on it 
 and all this it for what is to come of it all this wasting my life never having a peace either with child or nursing a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worrying others repulsive to my husband while the children are growing up unhappy badly educated and penniless even now if it for spending the summer at the levins i know how we should be managing to live of course kostia and kitty have so much tact that we feel it but it go on have children they be able to keep us a drag on them as it is how is papa who has hardly anything left for himself to help us so that i even bring the children up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation why even if we suppose the greatest good luck that the children die and i bring them up somehow at the very best simply be decent people all i can hope for and to gain simply that what agonies what toil whole life ruined again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said and again she was revolted at the thought but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words 
 is it far now mikhaila darya alexandrovna asked the countinghouse clerk to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her 
 from this village they say seven verstas 
 the carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge on the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders cheerfully chattering they stood still on the bridge staring inquisitively at the carriage all the faces turned to darya alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy making her envious of their enjoyment of life all living all enjoying life darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage while i let out as it were from prison from the world of worries that fret me to death am only looking about me now for an instant they all live those peasant women and my sister natalie and varenka and anna whom i am going to see all but not i 
 and they attack anna what for am i any better i have at any rate a husband i love not as i should like to love him still i do love him while anna never loved hers how is she to blame she wants to live god has put that in our hearts very likely i should have done the same even to this day i feel sure i did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in moscow i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life anew i might have loved and have been loved in reality and is it any better as it is i respect him necessary to me she thought about her husband and i put up with him is that any better at that time i could still have been admired i had beauty left me still darya alexandrovna pursued her thoughts and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag and she wanted to take it out but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying countinghouse clerk she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round and she did not take out the glass 
 but without looking in the glass she thought that even now it was not too late and she thought of sergei ivanovich who was always particularly attentive to her of goodhearted friend turovtsin who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina and was in love with her and there was someone else quite a young man who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters and the most passionate and impossible romances rose before darya imagination anna did quite right and certainly i shall never reproach her for it she is happy she makes another person happy and not broken down as i am but most likely just as she always was bright clever open to every impression thought darya alexandrovna and a sly smile curved her lips for as she pondered on love affair darya alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who was in love with her she like anna confessed the whole affair to her husband and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevich at this avowal made her smile 
 in such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to vozdivzhenskoe

 the coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right to a field of rye where some peasants were sitting near a telega the countinghouse clerk was just going to jump down but on second thought he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead and beckoned to them to come up the wind that seemed to blow as they drove dropped when the carriage stood still gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe that came to them from the telega ceased one of the peasants got up and came toward the carriage 
 well you are slow the countinghouse clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the unbeaten road come along do 
 a old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair and his bent back dark with perspiration came toward the carriage quickening his steps and took hold of the mudguard with his sunburned hand 
 vozdvizhenskoe the manor house the he repeated go on to the end of this slope then turn to the left straight along the avenue and come right upon it but whom do you want the count himself 
 well are they at home my good man darya alexandrovna said vaguely not knowing how to ask about anna even of this peasant 
 at home for sure said the peasant shifting from one bare foot to the other and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust sure to be at home he repeated evidently eager to talk only yesterday visitors arrived a sight of visitors come what do you want he turned round and called to a lad who was shouting something to him from the telega oh they all rode by here not long since to look at a reaping machine be home by now and who may you belong to 
 come a long way said the coachman climbing onto the box so not far 
 i tell you just here as soon as you get out he said keeping hold all the while of the mudguard of the carriage 
 a young fellow came up too 
 what is it laborers they want for the harvest he asked 
 i know my boy 
 so you keep to the left and come right on it said the peasant unmistakably loath to let the travelers go and eager to converse 
 the coachman started the horses but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted stop hi friend stop the coachman stopped 
 coming yonder shouted the peasant see what a turnout he said pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a charabanc coming along the road 
 they were vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviiazhsky in the charabanc they had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine 
 when the carriage stopped the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace anna was in front beside veslovsky anna was quietly walking her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail anna with her beautiful head her black hair straying loose under her high hat her full shoulders her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impressed dolly 
 for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on horseback the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was in darva mind associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion was unbecoming in position but when she had scrutinized her seeing her closer she was at once reconciled to her riding in spite of her elegance everything was so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movements of anna that nothing could have been more natural 
 by the side of anna on a gray cavalry horse was vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with floating ribbons his stout legs stretched out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a smile as she recognized him behind rode vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from galloping he was holding her in pulling at the reins 
 after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey sviiazhsky and princess varvara in a new charabanc with a big trotting horse overtook the party on horseback 
 face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage she recognized dolly she uttered a cry started in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop on reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance and holding up her riding habit she ran up to greet dolly 
 i thought it was you and dared not think it how delightful you fancy how glad i am she said at one moment pressing her face against dolly and kissing her and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile a delightful surprise alexei she said looking round at vronsky who had dismounted and was walking toward them 
 vronsky taking off his tall gray hat went up to dolly 
 you believe how glad we are to see you he said giving peculiar significance to the words and showing his strong white teeth in a smile 
 vassenka veslovsky without getting off his horse took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head 
 princess varvara anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the charabanc drove up 
 ah said darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction 
 princess varvara was her aunt and she had long known her and did not respect her she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole life toadying to her rich relations but that she should now be sponging on vronsky a man who was nothing to her mortified dolly on account of her kinship with her husband anna noticed expression and was disconcerted by it she blushed dropped her riding habit and stumbled over it 
 darya alexandrovna went up to the charabanc and coldly greeted princess varvara sviiazhsky too she knew he inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was and running his eyes over the horses and the carriage with its patched mudguards proposed to the ladies that they should get into the charabanc 
 and get in this vehicle he said the horse is quiet and the princess drives capitally 
 no stay as you were said anna coming up and go in the carriage and taking arm she drew her away 
 darya eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before the splendid horses and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her but what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in anna whom she knew so well and loved any other woman a less close observer not knowing anna before and particularly not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on the road would not have noticed anything special in anna but now dolly was struck by that temporary beauty which is only found in women during the moments of love and which she saw now in face everything in her face the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin the line of her lips the smile which as it were fluttered about her face the brilliance of her eyes the grace and rapidity of her movements the fullness of the notes of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answered veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost it was all peculiarly fascinating and it seemed as if anna herself were aware of it and rejoicing in it 
 when both the women were seated in the carriage a sudden embarrassment came over both of them anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry dolly fixed upon her dolly was embarrassed because after phrase about this vehicle she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna was sitting with her the coachman philip and the countinghouse clerk were experiencing the same sensation the countinghouse clerk to conceal his confusion busied himself settling the ladies but philip the coachman became sullen and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority he smiled ironically looking at the raven horse and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the charabanc was only good for promenade and do forty verstas straight off in the heat

 anna looked at thin careworn face with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking that is that dolly had grown thinner but conscious that she herself had grown handsomer and that eyes were telling her so she sighed and began to speak about herself 
 you are looking at me she said and wondering how i can be happy in my position well shameful to confess but i inexcusably happy something magical has happened to me like a dream when frightened and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more i have waked up i have lived through the misery the dread and now for a long while past especially since been here been so happy she said with a timid smile of inquiry looking at dolly 
 how glad i am said dolly smiling involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to very glad for you why you written to me 
 why because i the courage you forget my position 
 to me the courage if you knew how i i look at 
 darya alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so 
 but of that talk later this what are all these buildings she asked wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac quite a little town 
 but anna did not answer 
 no no how do you look at my position what do you think of it she asked 
 i consider darya alexandrovna was beginning but at that instant vassenka veslovsky having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost galloped past them bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the sidesaddle doing it anna arkadyevna he shouted anna did not even glance at him but again it seemed to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage and so she cut short her thought 
 i think anything she said but i always loved you and if one loves anyone one loves the whole person just as that person is and not as one would like her or him to be 
 anna taking her eyes off her face and dropping her eyelids this was a new habit dolly had not seen in her before pondered trying to penetrate the full significance of the words and obviously interpreting them as she would have wished she glanced at dolly 
 if you had any sins she said they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words 
 and dolly saw that the tears stood in her eyes she pressed hand in silence 
 well what are these buildings how many there are of them after a silence she repeated her question 
 these are the houses stud farm and stables answered anna and there the park begins it had all gone to ruin but alexei had everything renewed he is very fond of this place and what i never expected he has become intensely interested in looking after it but his is such a rich nature whatever he takes up he does splendidly so far from being bored by it he works with passionate interest he with his temperament as i know it he has become careful and businesslike a manager he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land but only in that when a question of tens of thousands he think of money she spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them of those they love do you see that big building the new hospital i believe it will cost over a hundred thousand his dada just now and do you know how it all came about the peasants asked him for some meadowland i think it was at a cheaper rate and he refused and i accused him of being miserly of course it was not really because of that but because of everything together he began this hospital to prove do you see that he was not miserly about money une petitesse if you like but i love him all the more for it and now see the house in a moment it was his house and he has had nothing changed outside 
 how beautiful said dolly looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns standing out among the greens of the old trees in the garden 
 it fine and from the house from the top the view is wonderful 
 they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mold of a flower bed and drew up in a covered entry 
 ah here already said anna looking at the saddle horses which were just being led away from the steps it is a good horse it my cob my favorite lead him here and bring me some sugar where is the count she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out ah there he is she said seeing vronsky coming to meet her with veslovsky 
 where are you going to put the princess said vronsky in french addressing anna and without waiting for a reply he once more greeted darya alexandrovna and this time he kissed her hand i think the big balcony room 
 oh no too far off better in the corner room we shall see each other more come go up said anna as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her 
 et vous oubliez votre devoir she said to veslovsky who came out too on the steps 
 pardon ai tout plein les poches he answered smiling putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket 
 mais vous venez trop tard she said rubbing her handkerchief on her hand which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar 
 anna turned to dolly you can stay some time for one day only impossible 
 i promised to be back and the children said dolly feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage and because she knew her face must be covered with dust 
 no dolly darling well see come along come along and anna led dolly to her room 
 that room was not the smart guestchamber vronsky had suggested but the one which anna had said dolly would surely excuse and this room for which excuse was needed was more full of luxury than any in which dolly had ever stayed a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad 
 well darling how happy i am anna said sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly tell me about all of you stiva i had only a glimpse of and he cannot tell one about the children how is my favorite tania quite a big girl i expect 
 yes very tall darya alexandrovna answered shortly surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children we are having a delightful stay at the levins she added 
 oh if i had known said anna that you do not despise me you might have all come to us an old friend and a great friend of you know she added and suddenly she blushed 
 yes but we are all dolly answered in confusion 
 but in my delight talking nonsense the one thing darling is that i am so glad to have you said anna kissing her again you told me yet how and what you think about me and i keep wanting to know but glad you will see me as i am the chief thing i like would be for people to imagine i want to prove anything i want to prove anything i merely want to live to do no one harm but myself i have the right to do that i but it is a big subject and talk over everything properly later now go and dress and send a maid to you

 these are the houses stud farm and stables answered anna and there the park begins it had all gone to ruin but alexei had everything renewed he is very fond of this place and what i never expected he has become intensely interested in looking after it but his is such a rich nature whatever he takes up he does splendidly so far from being bored by it he works with passionate interest he with his temperament as i know it he has become careful and businesslike a manager he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land but only in that when a question of tens of thousands he think of money she spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them of those they love do you see that big building the new hospital i believe it will cost over a hundred thousand his dada just now and do you know how it all came about the peasants asked him for some meadowland i think it was at a cheaper rate and he refused and i accused him of being miserly of course it was not really because of that but because of everything together he began this hospital to prove do you see that he was not miserly about money une petitesse if you like but i love him all the more for it and now see the house in a moment it was his house and he has had nothing changed outside 
 how beautiful said dolly looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns standing out among the greens of the old trees in the garden 
 it fine and from the house from the top the view is wonderful 
 they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mold of a flower bed and drew up in a covered entry 
 ah here already said anna looking at the saddle horses which were just being led away from the steps it is a good horse it my cob my favorite lead him here and bring me some sugar where is the count she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out ah there he is she said seeing vronsky coming to meet her with veslovsky 
 where are you going to put the princess said vronsky in french addressing anna and without waiting for a reply he once more greeted darya alexandrovna and this time he kissed her hand i think the big balcony room 
 oh no too far off better in the corner room we shall see each other more come go up said anna as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her 
 et vous oubliez votre devoir she said to veslovsky who came out too on the steps 
 pardon ai tout plein les poches he answered smiling putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket 
 mais vous venez trop tard she said rubbing her handkerchief on her hand which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar 
 anna turned to dolly you can stay some time for one day only impossible 
 i promised to be back and the children said dolly feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage and because she knew her face must be covered with dust 
 no dolly darling well see come along come along and anna led dolly to her room 
 that room was not the smart guestchamber vronsky had suggested but the one which anna had said dolly would surely excuse and this room for which excuse was needed was more full of luxury than any in which dolly had ever stayed a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad 
 well darling how happy i am anna said sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly tell me about all of you stiva i had only a glimpse of and he cannot tell one about the children how is my favorite tania quite a big girl i expect 
 yes very tall darya alexandrovna answered shortly surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children we are having a delightful stay at the levins she added 
 oh if i had known said anna that you do not despise me you might have all come to us an old friend and a great friend of you know she added and suddenly she blushed 
 yes but we are all dolly answered in confusion 
 but in my delight talking nonsense the one thing darling is that i am so glad to have you said anna kissing her again you told me yet how and what you think about me and i keep wanting to know but glad you will see me as i am the chief thing i like would be for people to imagine i want to prove anything i want to prove anything i merely want to live to do no one harm but myself i have the right to do that i but it is a big subject and talk over everything properly later now go and dress and send a maid to you

 left alone darya alexandrovna with a good eye scanned her room all she had seen in entering the house and walking through it and all she saw now in her room gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she had only read in english novels but had never seen in russia and in the country everything was new from the new french hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor the bed had a spring mattress and a special sort of bolster and taffeta pillowcases on the small pillows the marble washstand the dressing table the little sofa the tables the bronze clock on the chimney piece the window curtains and the portieres were all new and expensive 
 the smart maid who came in to offer her services with her hair done up high and a gown more fashionable that was as new and expensive as the whole room darya alexandrovna liked her neatness her deferential and obliging manners but she felt ill at ease with her she felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her she was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home at home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed arsheenes of nainsook at kopecks the yard which was a matter of fifteen roubles besides the cutting out and making and these fifteen roubles had been saved but before the maid she felt if not exactly ashamed at least uncomfortable 
 darya alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when annushka whom she had known for years walked in the smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress and annushka remained with darya alexandrovna 
 annushka was obviously much pleased at that arrival and began to chatter away without a pause dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her position especially as to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna but dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this 
 i grew up with anna arkadyevna my dearer to me than anything well not for us to judge and to be sure there seems so much love 
 kindly order these things washed for me please darya alexandrovna cut her short 
 certainly two women kept specially for washing small things but most of the done by machinery the count goes into everything himself ah what a husband he would make 
 dolly was glad when anna came in and by her entrance put a stop to gossip 
 anna had put on a very simple batiste gown dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively she knew what it meant and the price at which such simplicity was obtained 
 an old friend said anna of annushka 
 anna was not embarrassed now she was perfectly composed and at ease dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her and had assumed that superficial careless tone which as it were closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and intimate meditations were kept 
 well anna and how is your little girl asked dolly 
 annie this was what she called her little daughter anna very well she has got on wonderfully would you like to see her come show her to you we had a terrible bother she began telling her over nurses we had an italian wet nurse a good creature but so stupid we wanted to get rid of her but the baby is so used to her that gone on keeping her still 
 but how have you managed dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have but noticing a sudden frown on face she changed the drift of her question how did you manage have you weaned her yet 
 but anna had understood 
 you mean to ask that you meant to ask about her surname yes that worries alexei she has no name that is a karenina said anna dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting but talk about all that later her face suddenly brightening come show her to you elle est trs gentille she crawls now 
 in the nursery the luxury which had impressed dolly in the whole house struck her still more there were little gocarts ordered from england and appliances for learning to walk and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table purposely constructed for crawling and swings and baths all of special pattern and modern they were all english solid and of good make and obviously very expensive the room was large and very light and lofty 
 when they went in the baby with nothing on but her little smock was sitting in a little elbowchair at the table having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest the baby was being fed and the russian nurserymaid was evidently sharing her meal neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were there they were in the next room from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer french which was their only means of communication 
 hearing voice a smart tall english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door hurriedly shaking her fair curls and immediately began to defend herself though anna had not found fault with her at every word anna said the english nurse said hurriedly several times yes my lady 
 the rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair her sturdy red little body with tight skin delighted darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger she positively envied the healthy appearance she was delighted too at the crawling not one of her own children had crawled like that when the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind it was wonderfully charming looking round like some little wild animal at the big people with her bright black eyes she smiled unmistakably pleased at their admiring her and holding her legs sideways she pressed vigorously on her arms and rapidly drew her whole back up after and then made another step forward with her little arms 
 but the whole atmosphere of the nursery and especially the english nurse darya alexandrovna did not like at all it was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing indecorous woman as nurse to her child besides from a few words that were dropped darya alexandrovna saw at once that anna the two nurses and the child had no existence in common and that the visit was something exceptional anna wanted to get the baby her plaything and could not find it 
 most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had anna answered wrong and knew nothing about the two last teeth 
 i sometimes feel sorry as it were superfluous here said anna going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything standing near the doorway it was very different with my first child 
 i expected it to be the other way said darya alexandrovna shyly 
 oh no by the way do you know i saw seriozha said anna screwing up her eyes as though looking at something far away but talk about that later you believe it like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her and she does not know what to begin on first the full dinner is you and the talks i have before me with you which i could never have with anyone else and i know which subject to begin upon first mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien i must have everything out with you oh i ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us she began begin with the ladies princess varvara you know her and i know your opinion and about her stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over auntie katerina pavlovna all true but a woman and i am so grateful to her in peterburg there was a moment when un chaperon was absolutely essential for me then she turned up but really she is she did a great deal to alleviate my position i see you understand all the difficulty of my position there in peterburg she added here perfectly at ease and happy well of that later on though then sviiazhsky the marshal of the district and a very good sort of a man but he wants to get something out of alexei you understand with his property now that we are settled in the country alexei can exercise great influence then tushkevich you have seen him you know admirer now been thrown over and come to see us as alexei says one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be et puis il est comme il faut as princess varvara says then veslovsky you know him a very charming boy she said and a sly smile curved her lips this wild story about him and the levins veslovsky told alexei about it and we believe it il est tres gentil et she said again with the same smile men need occupation and alexei needs a circle so i value all these people we have to have the house lively and gay so that alexei may not long for any novelty then see the steward a german a very good fellow and he understands his work alexei has a very high opinion of him then the doctor a young man not quite a nihilist perhaps but you know he eats with his knife but a very good doctor then the architect une petite cour

 dolly for you princess you were so anxious to see her said anna coming out with darya alexandrovna on the stone terrace where princess varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame working at a cover for count alexei easy chair she says she want anything before dinner but please order some lunch for her and go look for alexei and bring them all in 
 princess varvara gave dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception and began at once explaining to her that she was living with anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister that aunt that had brought anna up and that now when everyone had abandoned anna she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition 
 her husband will give her a divorce and then i shall go back to my solitude but now i can be of use and i am doing my duty however difficult it may be for me not like some other people and how sweet it is of you how right of you to have come they live like the best of married couples for god to judge them not for us and biriuzovsky and madame avenieva and nikandrov himself and vassiliev with madame mamonova and liza neptunova did no one say anything about them and it has ended by their being received by everyone and then un intrieur si joli si comme il faut on se reunit le matin au breakfast et puis on se separe everyone does as he pleases till dinnertime dinner at seven stiva did very rightly to send you he needs their support you know that through his mother and brother he can do everything and then they do so much good he tell you about his hospital ce sera admirable everything from paris 
 their conversation was interrupted by anna who had found the men of the party in the billiard room and returned with them to the terrace there was still a long time before the dinner hour it was exquisite weather and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed there were very many methods of passing the time at vozdvizhenskoe and these were all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe 
 une partie de lawn tennis veslovsky proposed with his handsome smile be partners again anna arkadyevna 
 no too hot better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat show darya alexandrovna the riverbanks vronsky proposed 
 i agree to anything said sviiazhsky 
 i imagine that what dolly would like best would be a stroll you and then the boat perhaps said anna 
 so it was decided veslovsky and tushkevich went off to the bathing place promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them 
 they walked along the path in two couples anna with sviiazhsky and dolly with vronsky dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself abstractly theoretically she did not merely justify she positively approved of conduct as is indeed not infrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue weary of the monotony of virtuous existence at a distance she not only excused illicit love she positively envied it besides she loved anna with all her heart but seeing anna in actual life among these strangers with this fashionable tone that was so new to darya alexandrovna she felt ill at ease what she disliked particularly was seeing princess varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed 
 as a general principle abstractly dolly approved of action but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her moreover she had never liked vronsky she thought him very proud and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth but against her own will here in his own house he imposed upon her more than ever and she could not be at ease with him she experienced with him the same feeling she had had the maid about her dressing jacket just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at her darns so she felt with him not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at herself 
 dolly was ill at ease and tried to find a subject of conversation even though she supposed that through his pride praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him she did all the same tell him how much she liked his house 
 yes a very fine building and in the good style he said 
 i like so much the court in front of the steps was that always so 
 oh no he said and his face beamed with pleasure if you could only have seen the court last spring 
 and he began at first rather diffidently but more and more carried away by the subject as he went on to draw her attention to the various details of the decoration of his house and garden it was evident that having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person and was genuinely delighted at darya praise 
 if you would care to look at the hospital and are not really tired not far shall we go he said glancing into her face to convince himself that she was not bored are you coming anna he turned to her 
 we will come we she said addressing sviiazhsky mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevich se morfondre l dans le bateau we must send and tell them 
 yes this is a monument he is setting up here said anna turning to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital 
 oh a work of real importance said sviiazhsky but to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with vronsky he promptly added some slightly critical remarks i wonder though count he said that while you do so much for the health of the peasants you take so little interest in the schools 
 devenu tellement commun les coles said vronsky you understand not on that account but it just happens so my interest has been diverted elsewhere this way then to the hospital he said to darya alexandrovna pointing to a side path leading out of the avenue 
 the ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path after going down several turnings and going through a little gate darya alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large red building almost finished the iron roof which was not yet painted shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine beside the finished building another had been begun surrounded by scaffolding workmen in aprons standing on scaffolds were laying bricks pouring mortar out of vats and smoothing it with trowels 
 how quickly work gets done with you said sviiazhsky when i was here last time the roof was not on 
 by the autumn it will all be ready inside almost everything is done said anna 
 and this new building 
 the house for the doctor and the dispensary answered vronsky seeing the architect in a short jacket coming toward him and excusing himself to the ladies he went to meet him 
 going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly 
 the pediment looks still too low he said to anna who had asked what was the matter 
 i said the foundation ought to be raised said anna 
 yes of course it would have been much better anna arkadyevna said the architect but now too late 
 yes i take a great interest in it anna answered sviiazhsky who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture this new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital it was an afterthought and was begun without a plan 
 vronsky having finished his talk with the architect joined the ladies and led them inside the hospital 
 although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor upstairs almost all the rooms were finished going up the broad staircase to the landing they walked into the first large room the walls were stuccoed to look like marble the huge windows were already in only the parquet floor was not yet finished and the carpenters who were planing a block of it left their work taking off the bands that fastened their hair to greet the gentry 
 this is the reception room said vronsky here there will be a desk a cupboard and benches and nothing more 
 this way let us go in here go near the window said anna trying the paint to see if it were dry alexei the dry already she added 
 from the reception room they went into the corridor here vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system then he showed them marble baths and beds with extraordinary springs then he showed them the wards one after another the storeroom the linen room then the heating stove of a new pattern then the trolleys which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors and many other things sviiazhsky as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements appreciated everything fully dolly simply wondered at all as something she had not seen before and anxious to understand it all made minute inquiries about everything which gave vronsky apparent satisfaction 
 yes i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in russia said sviiazhsky 
 and you have a ward asked dolly so much needed in the country i have often 
 in spite of his usual courtesy vronsky interrupted her 
 this is not a home but a hospital for the sick and is intended for all diseases except infectious complaints he said ah look at this and he rolled up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for convalescents look he sat down in the chair and began moving it the patient walk still too weak perhaps or something wrong with his legs but he must have air and he moves rolls himself along 
 darya alexandrovna was interested by everything she liked everything very much but most of all she liked vronsky himself with his natural simplehearted enthusiasm yes a very dear good man she thought several times not hearing what he said but looking at him and penetrating into his expression while she mentally put herself in place she liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how anna could be in love with him

 yes this is a monument he is setting up here said anna turning to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital 
 oh a work of real importance said sviiazhsky but to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with vronsky he promptly added some slightly critical remarks i wonder though count he said that while you do so much for the health of the peasants you take so little interest in the schools 
 devenu tellement commun les coles said vronsky you understand not on that account but it just happens so my interest has been diverted elsewhere this way then to the hospital he said to darya alexandrovna pointing to a side path leading out of the avenue 
 the ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path after going down several turnings and going through a little gate darya alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large red building almost finished the iron roof which was not yet painted shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine beside the finished building another had been begun surrounded by scaffolding workmen in aprons standing on scaffolds were laying bricks pouring mortar out of vats and smoothing it with trowels 
 how quickly work gets done with you said sviiazhsky when i was here last time the roof was not on 
 by the autumn it will all be ready inside almost everything is done said anna 
 and this new building 
 the house for the doctor and the dispensary answered vronsky seeing the architect in a short jacket coming toward him and excusing himself to the ladies he went to meet him 
 going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly 
 the pediment looks still too low he said to anna who had asked what was the matter 
 i said the foundation ought to be raised said anna 
 yes of course it would have been much better anna arkadyevna said the architect but now too late 
 yes i take a great interest in it anna answered sviiazhsky who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture this new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital it was an afterthought and was begun without a plan 
 vronsky having finished his talk with the architect joined the ladies and led them inside the hospital 
 although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor upstairs almost all the rooms were finished going up the broad staircase to the landing they walked into the first large room the walls were stuccoed to look like marble the huge windows were already in only the parquet floor was not yet finished and the carpenters who were planing a block of it left their work taking off the bands that fastened their hair to greet the gentry 
 this is the reception room said vronsky here there will be a desk a cupboard and benches and nothing more 
 this way let us go in here go near the window said anna trying the paint to see if it were dry alexei the dry already she added 
 from the reception room they went into the corridor here vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system then he showed them marble baths and beds with extraordinary springs then he showed them the wards one after another the storeroom the linen room then the heating stove of a new pattern then the trolleys which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors and many other things sviiazhsky as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements appreciated everything fully dolly simply wondered at all as something she had not seen before and anxious to understand it all made minute inquiries about everything which gave vronsky apparent satisfaction 
 yes i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in russia said sviiazhsky 
 and you have a ward asked dolly so much needed in the country i have often 
 in spite of his usual courtesy vronsky interrupted her 
 this is not a home but a hospital for the sick and is intended for all diseases except infectious complaints he said ah look at this and he rolled up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for convalescents look he sat down in the chair and began moving it the patient walk still too weak perhaps or something wrong with his legs but he must have air and he moves rolls himself along 
 darya alexandrovna was interested by everything she liked everything very much but most of all she liked vronsky himself with his natural simplehearted enthusiasm yes a very dear good man she thought several times not hearing what he said but looking at him and penetrating into his expression while she mentally put herself in place she liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how anna could be in love with him

 no i think the princess is tired and horses interest her vronsky said to anna who wanted to go on to the stud farm where sviiazhsky wished to see the new stallion you go on while i escort the princess home and have a little talk he said if you would like that he added turning to her 
 i know nothing about horses and i shall be delighted to go back with you answered darya alexandrovna rather astonished 
 she saw by face that he wanted something from her she was not mistaken as soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden he looked in the direction anna had taken and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them he began 
 you guess that i have something i want to say to you he said looking at her with laughing eyes i am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of he took off his hat and taking out his handkerchief wiped his head which was growing bald 
 
 darya alexandrovna made no answer and merely stared at him with dismay when she was left alone with him she suddenly felt afraid his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her 
 the most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to say to her flashed into her brain he is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children and i shall have to refuse or to create a set that will receive anna in moscow or it vassenka veslovsky and his relations with anna or perhaps about kitty that he feels he was to blame all her conjectures were unpleasant but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her 
 you have so much influence with anna she is so fond of you he said do help me 
 darya alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face which under the linden trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine and then passing into complete shadow again she waited for him to say more but he walked in silence beside her scratching with his cane in the gravel 
 you have come to see us you the only woman of former friends i count princess varvara but i know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal but because understanding all the difficulty of the position you still love her and want to be a help to her have i understood you rightly he asked looking round at her 
 oh yes answered darya alexandrovna putting down her sunshade but 
 no he broke in and unconsciously oblivious of the awkward position in which he was putting his companion he stopped abruptly so that she had to stop short too no one feels more deeply and intensely than i do all the difficulty of position and that you may well understand if you do me the honor of supposing i have any heart i am to blame for that position and that is why i feel it 
 i understand said darya alexandrovna involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this but just because you feel yourself responsible you exaggerate it i am afraid she said her position in the world is difficult i can well understand 
 in the world it is hell he brought out quickly frowning darkly you imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in peterburg during that fortnight and i beg you to believe it 
 yes but here so long as neither anna nor you want society 
 society he said contemptuously how could i want society 
 so far and it may be so always you are happy and at peace i see in anna that she is happy perfectly happy she has had time to tell me so much already said darya alexandrovna smiling and involuntarily as she said this at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether anna really were happy 
 but vronsky it appeared had no doubts on that score 
 yes yes he said i know that she has revived after all her sufferings she is happy she is happy in the present but i i am afraid of what is before us i beg your pardon you would like to walk on 
 no i mind 
 well then let us sit here 
 darya alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue he stood up facing her 
 i see that she is happy he repeated and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into darya mind but can it last whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question but the die is cast he said passing from russian to french and we are bound together for life we are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred we have a child we may have other children but the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see at present and does not want to see setting her heart at rest after all these sufferings and ordeals and that one can well understand but i help seeing them my daughter is by law not my daughter but i cannot bear this falsity he said with a vigorous gesture of refusal and he looked with gloomy inquiry toward darya alexandrovna 
 she made no answer but simply gazed at him he went on 
 one day a son may be born my son and he will be legally a karenin he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have there will be no real tie between us they will be you will understand the bitterness and horror of this position i have tried to speak of this to anna it irritates her she does not understand and to her i cannot speak plainly of all this now look at another side i am happy happy in her love but i must have occupation i have found occupation and am proud of what i am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army and most certainly i would not change the work i am doing for theirs i am working here settled in my own place and i am happy and contented and we need nothing more to make us happy i love my work here ce pas un on the contrary 
 darya alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused and she did not quite understand this digression but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart of which he could not speak to anna he was now making a clean breast of everything and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same compartment of his intimate meditations as the question of his relations with anna 
 well i will go on he said collecting himself the great thing is that as i work i want to have a conviction that what i am doing will not die with me that i shall have heirs to come after me and this i have not conceive the position of a man who knows that his children the children of the woman he loves will not be his but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them it is awful 
 he paused evidently much moved 
 yes indeed i see that but what can anna do queried darya alexandrovna 
 yes that brings me to the object of my conversation he said calming himself with an effort anna can it depends on her even to petition the czar for legitimization a divorce is essential and that depends on anna her husband agreed to a divorce at that time your husband had arranged it completely and now i know he would not refuse it it is only a matter of writing to him he said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire he would not refuse of course he said gloomily it is one of those pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable he knows what agony any recollection of him must give her and knowing her he must have a letter from her i can understand that it is agony to her but the matter is of such importance that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment il y va du bonheur et de et de ses enfants i speak of myself though hard for me very hard he said with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him and so it is princess that i am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce 
 yes of course darya alexandrovna said dreamily as she vividly recalled her last interview with alexei alexandrovich yes of course she repeated with decision thinking of anna 
 use your influence with her make her write i like almost unable to speak about this to her 
 very well i will talk to her but how is it she does not think of it herself said darya alexandrovna and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled strange new habit of her eyes and she remembered that anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon just as though she her eyes to her own life so as not to see everything thought dolly yes indeed for my own sake and for hers i will talk to her dolly said in reply to his expression of gratitude 
 they got up and walked to the house

 chapter 
 
 when anna found dolly at home before her she looked intently in her eyes as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky but she made no inquiry in words 
 i believe dinnertime she said not seen each other at all yet i am reckoning on the evening now i want to go and dress i expect you do too we all got splashed at the buildings 
 dolly went to her room and she felt amused to change her dress was impossible for she had already put on her best dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she asked the maid to brush her dress changed her cuffs and rosette and put some lace on her head 
 this is all i can do she said with a smile to anna who came in to her in a third dress again of extreme simplicity 
 yes we are too prim here she said as it were apologizing for her finery alexei is delighted at your visit as he rarely is at anything he has completely lost his heart to you she added not tired 
 there was no time for talking about anything before dinner going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats the architect wore a coat vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital 
 a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat announced that dinner was ready and the ladies got up vronsky asked sviiazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offered his arm to dolly veslovsky was before tushkevich in offering his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevich with the steward and the doctor walked in alone 
 the dinner the dining room the service the waiting at table the wine and the food were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout the house but seemed even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household though she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she could not help scrutinizing every detail and wondering how and by whom it was all done vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviiazhsky and many other people she knew would never have considered this question and would have readily believed what every host tries to make his guests feel that is that all that is in his house has cost him the host no trouble whatever but comes of itself darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the breakfast does not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexei kirillovich scanned the table from the way he nodded to the butler and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviiazhsky the princess and veslovsky were equally guests with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them 
 anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present like the steward and the architect belonging to a completely different world struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observed 
 the conversation began about the row tushkevich and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat and tushkevich began describing the last boat races in peterburg at the yacht club but anna seizing the first pause at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence 
 nikolai ivanich was struck she said meaning sviiazhsky at the progress the new building had made since he was here last but i am there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows 
 working with his excellency said the architect with a smile he was respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities where one would have to write out sheaves of papers here i call upon the count and in three words we settle the business 
 the american way of doing business said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 yes there they build in a rational fashion 
 the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly brought it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk 
 have you ever seen a reaping machine she said addressing darya alexandrovna we had just ridden over to look at one when we met the first time i ever saw one 
 how do they work asked dolly 
 exactly like scissors a plank and a lot of little scissors like this 
 anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings and began showing how the machine worked it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining 
 more like little penknives veslovsky said playfully never taking his eyes off her 
 anna gave a just perceptible smile but made no answer it true karl fedorich that just like scissors she said to the steward 
 oh ja answered the german es ist ein ganz einfaches ding and he began to explain the construction of the machine 
 a pity it bind too i saw one at the vienna exhibition which binds with a wire said sviiazhsky they would be more profitable in use 
 es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden and the german roused from his taciturnity turned to vronsky das sich ausrechnen erlaucht the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in but recollecting that he was at a dinner and observing chilly glance he checked himself zu compliziert macht zu viel pains he concluded 
 wnscht man gains so hat man auch pains said vassenka veslovsky bantering the german he addressed anna again with the same smile 
 cessez she said with playful severity 
 we expected to find you in the fields vassilii semionich she said to the doctor a man have you been there 
 i went there but i evaporated the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness 
 then taken a good constitutional 
 splendid 
 well and how was the old woman i hope not typhus 
 typhus it but not to be found to the best advantage 
 what a pity said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends 
 it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna sviiazhsky said jestingly 
 oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviiazhsky too this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly 
 but anna knowledge of architecture is marvelous said tushkevich 
 to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna saying yesterday by cramp and plinths said veslovsky have i got it right 
 nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it said anna but i dare say you even know what houses are made of 
 darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of playfulness that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will 
 vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attached no significance to chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests 
 come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together 
 by cement of course 
 bravo and what is cement 
 oh some sort of paste no putty said veslovsky raising a general laugh 
 the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other of the company to the quick once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterward whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant sviiazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture 
 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject 
 turkish views in general veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile 
 i defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said flaring up but i can say that a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so 
 i like him extremely and we are great friends sviiazhsky said smiling mais pardon il est un petit peu toque he maintains for instance that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything 
 our russian apathy said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties 
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties said darya alexandrovna irritated by tone of superiority 
 for my part pursued vronsky who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation such as i am i am on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have done me thanks to nikolai ivanich he indicated sviiazhsky in electing me an honorary justice of the peace i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse is as important as anything i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner unluckily they understand the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state 
 it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table she thought how levin who believed the opposite was just as positive in his opinions at his own table but she loved levin and so she was on his side 
 so we can reckon upon you count for the coming elections said sviiazhsky but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do me the honor to stop with me 
 i rather agree with your said anna though not quite on the same ground as he she added with a smile afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing so now doing some sort of public duty alexei has been here now six months and a member i do believe of five or six different public bodies a guardian a justice of the peace a member of the council a juryman an equine something du train que cela va his whole time will be wasted on it and afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies end in being a mere form how many are you a member of nikolai ivanich she turned to sviiazhsky over twenty i fancy 
 anna spoke lightly but irritation could be discerned in her tone darya alexandrovna watching anna and vronsky attentively detected it instantly she noticed too that as she spoke face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression noticing this and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of peterburg acquaintances and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky 
 the dinner the wine the dinner set were all very good but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her it all had the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her 
 after dinner they sat on the terrace then they proceeded to play lawn tennis the players divided into two parties stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play but it was a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players her partner tushkevich gave up playing too but the others kept the game up for a long time sviiazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them and without loitering they ran adroitly up to them waited for the rebound and neatly and accurately returned them over the net veslovsky played worse than the others he was too eager but he kept the players lively with his high spirits his laughter and outcries never paused like the other men of the party with the ladies permission he took off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirt sleeves with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory 
 when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night as soon as she closed her eyes she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground 
 during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself she did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of people all alone without children playing at a game but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she joined the game again and pretended to be enjoying it all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance 
 she had come with the intention of staying two days if all went well but in the evening during the game she made up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal cares and worries which she had so hated on the way now after a day spent without them struck her in quite another light and tempted her back to them 
 when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna went alone to her room took off her dress and began arranging her thin hair for the night she had a great sense of relief 
 it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna would be coming to see her immediately she longed to be alone with her own thoughts

 when anna found dolly at home before her she looked intently in her eyes as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky but she made no inquiry in words 
 i believe dinnertime she said not seen each other at all yet i am reckoning on the evening now i want to go and dress i expect you do too we all got splashed at the buildings 
 dolly went to her room and she felt amused to change her dress was impossible for she had already put on her best dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she asked the maid to brush her dress changed her cuffs and rosette and put some lace on her head 
 this is all i can do she said with a smile to anna who came in to her in a third dress again of extreme simplicity 
 yes we are too prim here she said as it were apologizing for her finery alexei is delighted at your visit as he rarely is at anything he has completely lost his heart to you she added not tired 
 there was no time for talking about anything before dinner going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats the architect wore a coat vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital 
 a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat announced that dinner was ready and the ladies got up vronsky asked sviiazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offered his arm to dolly veslovsky was before tushkevich in offering his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevich with the steward and the doctor walked in alone 
 the dinner the dining room the service the waiting at table the wine and the food were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout the house but seemed even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household though she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she could not help scrutinizing every detail and wondering how and by whom it was all done vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviiazhsky and many other people she knew would never have considered this question and would have readily believed what every host tries to make his guests feel that is that all that is in his house has cost him the host no trouble whatever but comes of itself darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the breakfast does not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexei kirillovich scanned the table from the way he nodded to the butler and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviiazhsky the princess and veslovsky were equally guests with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them 
 anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present like the steward and the architect belonging to a completely different world struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observed 
 the conversation began about the row tushkevich and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat and tushkevich began describing the last boat races in peterburg at the yacht club but anna seizing the first pause at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence 
 nikolai ivanich was struck she said meaning sviiazhsky at the progress the new building had made since he was here last but i am there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows 
 working with his excellency said the architect with a smile he was respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities where one would have to write out sheaves of papers here i call upon the count and in three words we settle the business 
 the american way of doing business said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 yes there they build in a rational fashion 
 the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly brought it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk 
 have you ever seen a reaping machine she said addressing darya alexandrovna we had just ridden over to look at one when we met the first time i ever saw one 
 how do they work asked dolly 
 exactly like scissors a plank and a lot of little scissors like this 
 anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings and began showing how the machine worked it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining 
 more like little penknives veslovsky said playfully never taking his eyes off her 
 anna gave a just perceptible smile but made no answer it true karl fedorich that just like scissors she said to the steward 
 oh ja answered the german es ist ein ganz einfaches ding and he began to explain the construction of the machine 
 a pity it bind too i saw one at the vienna exhibition which binds with a wire said sviiazhsky they would be more profitable in use 
 es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden and the german roused from his taciturnity turned to vronsky das sich ausrechnen erlaucht the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in but recollecting that he was at a dinner and observing chilly glance he checked himself zu compliziert macht zu viel pains he concluded 
 wnscht man gains so hat man auch pains said vassenka veslovsky bantering the german he addressed anna again with the same smile 
 cessez she said with playful severity 
 we expected to find you in the fields vassilii semionich she said to the doctor a man have you been there 
 i went there but i evaporated the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness 
 then taken a good constitutional 
 splendid 
 well and how was the old woman i hope not typhus 
 typhus it but not to be found to the best advantage 
 what a pity said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends 
 it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna sviiazhsky said jestingly 
 oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviiazhsky too this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly 
 but anna knowledge of architecture is marvelous said tushkevich 
 to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna saying yesterday by cramp and plinths said veslovsky have i got it right 
 nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it said anna but i dare say you even know what houses are made of 
 darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of playfulness that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will 
 vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attached no significance to chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests 
 come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together 
 by cement of course 
 bravo and what is cement 
 oh some sort of paste no putty said veslovsky raising a general laugh 
 the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other of the company to the quick once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterward whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant sviiazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture 
 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject 
 turkish views in general veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile 
 i defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said flaring up but i can say that a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so 
 i like him extremely and we are great friends sviiazhsky said smiling mais pardon il est un petit peu toque he maintains for instance that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything 
 our russian apathy said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties 
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties said darya alexandrovna irritated by tone of superiority 
 for my part pursued vronsky who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation such as i am i am on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have done me thanks to nikolai ivanich he indicated sviiazhsky in electing me an honorary justice of the peace i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse is as important as anything i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner unluckily they understand the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state 
 it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table she thought how levin who believed the opposite was just as positive in his opinions at his own table but she loved levin and so she was on his side 
 so we can reckon upon you count for the coming elections said sviiazhsky but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do me the honor to stop with me 
 i rather agree with your said anna though not quite on the same ground as he she added with a smile afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing so now doing some sort of public duty alexei has been here now six months and a member i do believe of five or six different public bodies a guardian a justice of the peace a member of the council a juryman an equine something du train que cela va his whole time will be wasted on it and afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies end in being a mere form how many are you a member of nikolai ivanich she turned to sviiazhsky over twenty i fancy 
 anna spoke lightly but irritation could be discerned in her tone darya alexandrovna watching anna and vronsky attentively detected it instantly she noticed too that as she spoke face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression noticing this and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of peterburg acquaintances and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky 
 the dinner the wine the dinner set were all very good but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her it all had the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her 
 after dinner they sat on the terrace then they proceeded to play lawn tennis the players divided into two parties stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play but it was a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players her partner tushkevich gave up playing too but the others kept the game up for a long time sviiazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them and without loitering they ran adroitly up to them waited for the rebound and neatly and accurately returned them over the net veslovsky played worse than the others he was too eager but he kept the players lively with his high spirits his laughter and outcries never paused like the other men of the party with the ladies permission he took off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirt sleeves with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory 
 when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night as soon as she closed her eyes she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground 
 during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself she did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of people all alone without children playing at a game but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she joined the game again and pretended to be enjoying it all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance 
 she had come with the intention of staying two days if all went well but in the evening during the game she made up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal cares and worries which she had so hated on the way now after a day spent without them struck her in quite another light and tempted her back to them 
 when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna went alone to her room took off her dress and began arranging her thin hair for the night she had a great sense of relief 
 it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna would be coming to see her immediately she longed to be alone with her own thoughts

 chapter 
 
 dolly was just about to go to bed when anna came in to see her attired for the night 
 in the course of the day anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart and every time after a few words she had stopped afterward by ourselves talk about everything got so much i want to tell you she had said 
 now they were by themselves and anna did not know what to talk about she sat in the window looking at dolly and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand and she found nothing at that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already 
 well what of kitty she said with a heavy sigh looking penitently at dolly tell me the truth dolly she angry with me 
 angry oh no said darya alexandrovna smiling 
 but she hates me despises me 
 oh no but you know that sort of thing forgiven 
 yes yes said anna turning away and looking out of the open window but i was not to blame and who is to blame the meaning of being to blame could it have been otherwise what do you think could it possibly have happened otherwise than that you should become the wife of stiva 
 really i know but this is what i want you to tell me 
 yes yes but not finished about kitty is she happy a very fine man they say 
 much more than very fine i know a better man 
 ah how glad i am so glad much more than very fine she repeated 
 dolly smiled 
 but tell me about yourself a great deal to talk about and had a talk with dolly did not know what to call him she felt it awkward to call him either the count or alexei kirillovich 
 with alexei said anna i know what you talked about but i wanted to ask you directly what you think of me of my life 
 how am i to say anything so suddenly i really know 
 no tell me all the same you see my life but you forget that seeing us in the summer when you have come to us and we are not alone but we came here early in the spring lived quite alone and shall be alone again and i desire nothing better but imagine me living alone without him alone and that will be i see by everything that it will often be repeated that he will be half the time away from home she said getting up and sitting down close by dolly of course she interrupted dolly who would have answered of course i try to keep him by force i keep him indeed the races are just coming his horses are running he will go very glad but think of me fancy my position but the use of talking about it she smiled well what did he talk about with you 
 he spoke of what i want to speak about myself and easy for me to be his advocate of whether there is not a possibility whether you could not darya alexandrovna hesitated correct or improve your position you know how i look at it but all the same if possible you should get married 
 divorce you mean said anna do you know the only woman who came to see me in peterburg was betsy tverskaia you know her of course au fond la femme la plus dpravee qui existe she had an intrigue with tushkevich deceiving her husband in the basest way and she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular imagine i would compare i know you darling but i could not help remembering well so what did he say to you she repeated 
 he said that he was unhappy on your account and his own perhaps you will say that egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism he wants first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you 
 what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as i in my position she put in gloomily 
 the chief thing he desires he desires that you should not suffer 
 impossible well 
 well and the most legitimate desire he wishes that your children should have a name 
 what children anna said not looking at dolly and half closing her eyes 
 annie and those to come 
 he need not trouble on that score i shall have no more children 
 how can you tell that you 
 i shall not because i wish it and in spite of all her emotion anna smiled as she caught the expression of curiosity wonder and horror on face 
 the doctor told me after my illness 
 impossible said dolly opening her eyes wide for here this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it 
 this discovery suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her aroused so many ideas reflections and contradictory emotions that she had nothing to say and simply gazed with eyes of wonder at anna this was the very thing she had been dreaming of but now learning that it was possible she was horrified she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem 
 pas immoral was all she said after a brief pause 
 why so think i have a choice between two alternatives either to be with child that is an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband practically my husband anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous 
 yes yes said darya alexandrovna hearing the very arguments she had used to herself and not finding the same force in them as before 
 for you for other people said anna as though divining her thoughts there may be reason to hesitate but for me you must consider i am not his wife he loves me as long as he loves me and how am i to keep his love not like this 
 she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist 
 with extraordinary rapidity as happens during moments of excitement ideas and memories rushed into darya head i she thought did not keep my attraction for stiva he left me for others and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively he deserted her and took another and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way if that is what he looks for he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming and however white and beautiful her bare arms are however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls he will find something better still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband does 
 dolly made no answer she merely sighed anna noticed this sigh indicating dissent and she went on in her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them 
 do you say that not right but you must consider she went on you forget my position how can i desire children not speaking of the suffering not afraid of that think only what are my children to be children who will have to bear a name for the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth 
 but that is just why a divorce is necessary 
 but anna did not hear her she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself 
 what is reason given me for if i am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world 
 she looked at dolly but without waiting for a reply she went on 
 i should always feel i had wronged these unhappy children she said if there are none at any rate they are not unhappy while if they are unhappy i alone should be to blame for it 
 these were the very arguments darya alexandrovna had used in her own reflections but she heard them now without understanding them how can one wrong creatures that exist she thought and all at once the idea struck her could it possibly under any circumstances have been better for her favorite grisha if he had never existed and this seemed to her so wild so strange that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling mad ideas 
 no i know not right was all she said with an expression of disgust on her face 
 yes but you forget what you are and what i am and besides that added anna in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of objections seeming still to admit that it was not right forget the chief point that i am not now in the same position as you for you the question is do you desire not to have any more children while for me it is do i desire to have them and a great difference you must see that i desire them in my position 
 darya alexandrovna made no reply she suddenly felt that she had got away from anna so far that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree and about which it was better not to speak

 then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible said dolly 
 yes if possible said anna speaking all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful 
 surely you mean a divorce is impossible i was told your husband had consented to it 
 dolly i want to talk about that 
 oh we then darya alexandrovna hastened to say noticing the expression of suffering on face all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things 
 i not at all very satisfied and happy you see je fais passions veslovsky 
 yes to tell the truth i like tone said darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject 
 oh nonsense it amuses alexei and all but a boy and quite under control you know i turn him as i please just as it might be with your grisha dolly she suddenly changed the subject you say i take too gloomy a view of things you understand too awful i try not to take any view of it at all 
 but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can 
 but what can i do nothing you tell me to marry alexei and say i think about it i think about it she repeated and a flush rose into her face she got up straightening her chest and sighed heavily with her light step she began pacing up and down the room stopping now and then i think of it not a day not an hour passes that i think of it and blame myself for what i think because thinking of that may drive me mad drive me mad she repeated when i think of it i sleep without morphine but never mind let us talk quietly they tell me divorce in the first place he give me a divorce under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now 
 darya alexandrovna sitting erect on a chair turned her head following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering 
 you ought to make the attempt she said softly 
 suppose i make the attempt what does it mean she said evidently giving utterance to a thought a thousand times thought over and learned by heart it means that i hating him but still recognizing that i have wronged him and i consider him magnanimous that i humiliate myself to write to him well suppose i make the effort i do it either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent well i have received his consent say anna was at that moment at the farthest end of the room and she stopped there doing something to the curtain at the window i receive his consent but my my son they give him up to me he will grow up despising me with his father whom abandoned do you see i love equally i think but both more than myself two beings seriozha and alexei 
 she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly with her arms pressed tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad she bent her head and with shining wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shaking all over with emotion 
 it is only those two beings whom i love and one excludes the other i have them together and the only thing i want and since i have that i care about the rest i care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so i i like to talk of it so blame me judge me for anything you with your pure heart understand all that suffering 
 she went up sat down beside dolly and with a guilty look peeped into her face and took her hand 
 what are you thinking what are you thinking about me despise me i deserve contempt simply unhappy if anyone is unhappy i am she uttered and turning away she burst into tears 
 left alone dolly said her prayers and went to bed she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back the next day 
 anna meantime went back to her boudoir took a wineglass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine of which the principal ingredient was morphine after drinking it off and sitting still a little while she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind 
 when she went into the bedroom vronsky looked intently at her he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew staying so long in room she must have had with her but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect him he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord but she only said 
 i am so glad you like dolly you do you 
 oh known her a long while very goodhearted i suppose mais excessivement still very glad to see her 
 he took hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes 
 misinterpreting the look she smiled to him 
 next morning in spite of the protests of her hosts darya alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his horses and his carriage with the patched mudguards drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach 
 darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the gentlemen of the party after a day spent together both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together and that it was better for them not to meet only anna was sad she knew that now after departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation it hurt her to stir up these feelings but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly grow weedy in the life she was leading 
 as she drove out into the open country darya alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at when suddenly the coachman philip expressed himself unasked 
 rolling in wealth they may be but three pots of oats was all they gave us everything cleared up till there a grain left by what are three pots a mere mouthful and oats now you could get from innkeepers for kopecks at our place no fear all comers may have as much as they can eat 
 the a screw put in the countinghouse clerk 
 well did you like their horses asked dolly 
 the horses no two opinions about them and the food was good but it seemed to me sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna i know what you thought he said turning his handsome face to her 
 i thought so too well shall we get home by evening 
 eh we must 
 on reaching home and finding everyone entirely safe and particularly charming darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them about her arrival her warm reception about the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys lived and about their recreations and she would not allow a word to be said against them 
 one has to know anna and vronsky i have got to know him better now to see how fine they are and how touching she said speaking now with perfect sincerity and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there

 then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible said dolly 
 yes if possible said anna speaking all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful 
 surely you mean a divorce is impossible i was told your husband had consented to it 
 dolly i want to talk about that 
 oh we then darya alexandrovna hastened to say noticing the expression of suffering on face all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things 
 i not at all very satisfied and happy you see je fais passions veslovsky 
 yes to tell the truth i like tone said darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject 
 oh nonsense it amuses alexei and all but a boy and quite under control you know i turn him as i please just as it might be with your grisha dolly she suddenly changed the subject you say i take too gloomy a view of things you understand too awful i try not to take any view of it at all 
 but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can 
 but what can i do nothing you tell me to marry alexei and say i think about it i think about it she repeated and a flush rose into her face she got up straightening her chest and sighed heavily with her light step she began pacing up and down the room stopping now and then i think of it not a day not an hour passes that i think of it and blame myself for what i think because thinking of that may drive me mad drive me mad she repeated when i think of it i sleep without morphine but never mind let us talk quietly they tell me divorce in the first place he give me a divorce under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now 
 darya alexandrovna sitting erect on a chair turned her head following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering 
 you ought to make the attempt she said softly 
 suppose i make the attempt what does it mean she said evidently giving utterance to a thought a thousand times thought over and learned by heart it means that i hating him but still recognizing that i have wronged him and i consider him magnanimous that i humiliate myself to write to him well suppose i make the effort i do it either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent well i have received his consent say anna was at that moment at the farthest end of the room and she stopped there doing something to the curtain at the window i receive his consent but my my son they give him up to me he will grow up despising me with his father whom abandoned do you see i love equally i think but both more than myself two beings seriozha and alexei 
 she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly with her arms pressed tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad she bent her head and with shining wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shaking all over with emotion 
 it is only those two beings whom i love and one excludes the other i have them together and the only thing i want and since i have that i care about the rest i care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so i i like to talk of it so blame me judge me for anything you with your pure heart understand all that suffering 
 she went up sat down beside dolly and with a guilty look peeped into her face and took her hand 
 what are you thinking what are you thinking about me despise me i deserve contempt simply unhappy if anyone is unhappy i am she uttered and turning away she burst into tears 
 left alone dolly said her prayers and went to bed she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back the next day 
 anna meantime went back to her boudoir took a wineglass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine of which the principal ingredient was morphine after drinking it off and sitting still a little while she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind 
 when she went into the bedroom vronsky looked intently at her he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew staying so long in room she must have had with her but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect him he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord but she only said 
 i am so glad you like dolly you do you 
 oh known her a long while very goodhearted i suppose mais excessivement still very glad to see her 
 he took hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes 
 misinterpreting the look she smiled to him

 vronsky and anna spent the whole summer and part of the autumn in the country living in just the same condition and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce it was a decided thing between them that they should not go away anywhere but both felt the longer they lived alone especially in the autumn and without guests in the house that they could not stand this existence and that they would have to change it 
 their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired they had the fullest abundance of everything they had a child and both had occupation anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors and she did a great deal of reading both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and journals she received and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion moreover every subject that was of interest to vronsky she studied in books and special journals so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture sometimes even with questions relating to horse breeding or sport he was amazed at her knowledge her memory and at first was disposed to doubt it to ask for confirmation of her facts and she would find what he asked for in some book and show it to him 
 the building of the hospital too interested her she did not merely assist but planned and suggested a great deal herself but her chief thought was still of herself how far she was dear to vronsky how far she could make up to him for all he had given up vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please but to serve him which had become the sole aim of her existence but at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast as time went on and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares he had an desire not so much to escape from them as to try whether they hindered his freedom had it not been for this growing desire to be free not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a session or a race vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his life the role he had taken up the role of a wealthy landowner one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the russian aristocracy was entirely to his taste and now after spending six months in that role he derived even greater satisfaction from it and his management of his estate which occupied and absorbed him more and more was most successful in spite of the immense sums which the hospital the machinery the cows ordered from switzerland and many other things cost him he was convinced that he was not wasting but increasing his substance in all matters affecting income the sales of timber wheat and wool the letting of lands vronsky was hard as a rock and knew well how to keep up prices in all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required and then representing to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper and so make a profit vronsky did not give in he listened to his steward him and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest not yet known in russia and likely to excite wonder apart from such exceptions he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details and insisted on getting the very best for his money so that by the method on which he managed his affairs it was clear that he was not wasting but increasing his substance 
 in october there were the provincial nobility elections in the kashinsky province where were the estates of vronsky sviiazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of land 
 these elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them and also from the people taking part in them there had been a great deal of talk about these elections and great preparations were being made for them persons who never attended the elections were coming from moscow from peterburg and from abroad to attend these 
 vronsky had long before promised sviiazhsky to go to them 
 before the elections sviiazhsky who often visited vozdvizhenskoe drove over to fetch vronsky 
 on the day before there had been almost a quarrel between vronsky and anna over this proposed expedition it was the very dullest autumn weather which is so dreary in the country and so preparing himself for a struggle vronsky with a hard and cold expression informed anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before but to his surprise anna accepted the information with great composure and merely asked when he would be back he looked intently at her at a loss to explain this composure she smiled at his look he knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans he was afraid of this but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in her reasonableness 
 i hope you be dull 
 i hope not said anna i got a box of books yesterday from no i be dull 
 trying to take that tone and so much the better he thought or else it would be the same thing over and over again 
 and he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation it was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation from one point of view this troubled him but on the other side he felt that it was better so at first there will be as this time something undefined kept back and then she will get used to it in any case i can give up anything for her but not my masculine independence he thought

 in september levin moved to moscow for confinement he had spent a whole month in moscow with nothing to do when sergei ivanovich who had property in the kashinsky province and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections made ready to set off to the elections he invited his brother who had a vote in the selezniovsky district to come with him levin had moreover to transact in kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister who was abroad 
 levin still hesitated but kitty who saw that he was bored in moscow and urged him to go on her own authority ordered him the proper uniform costing eighty roubles and this eighty roubles paid for the uniform was the chief reason that finally decided levin to go he went to kashin 
 levin had been five days in kashin visiting the assembly each day and busily engaged about his business which still dragged on the district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship the other matter the receipt of the sums due was also met by difficulties after long negotiations over the lifting of the prohibition the money was at last ready to be paid but the notary a most obliging person could not hand over the order because it must have the signature of the president and the president though he had not given over his duties to a deputy was at the elections all these worrying negotiations this endless going from place to place and talking with pleasant and excellent people who quite saw the unpleasantness of the position but were powerless to assist him all these efforts that yielded no result led to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force he felt this frequently as he talked to his exceedingly solicitor this solicitor did it seemed everything possible and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties i tell you what you might try he said more than once go to and and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything but he would add immediately mean some delay anyway but you might try it and levin did try and did go everyone was kind and civil but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end and again to bar the way what was particularly trying was that levin could not make out with whom he was struggling to whose interest it was that his business should not be done that no one seemed to know the solicitor certainly did not know if levin could have understood why just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him but in the case of the hindrances that confronted him in his business no one could explain why they existed 
 but levin had changed a good deal since his marriage he was patient and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it and that most likely it must be so and he tried not to resent it 
 in attending the elections too and taking part in them he tried now not to judge not to fall foul of them but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected since his marriage there had been revealed to levin so many new and serious aspects of life which had previously through his frivolous attitude to them seemed of no importance that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance 
 sergei ivanovich explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed radical change at the elections the marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions the guardianship of wards the very department which was giving levin so much trouble just now the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province the high schools for girls for boys and military and primary instruction on the new statute and finally the zemstvo the marshal of the province snetkov was a nobleman of the old school dissipating an immense fortune a goodhearted man honest after his own fashion but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days he always took in every question the side of the nobility he was positively antagonistic to the spread of primary education and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the zemstvo which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance what was needed was to put in his place a fresh capable perfectly modern man of contemporary ideas and to frame their policy so as to derive from the rights conferred upon the nobles not as the nobility but as an element of the zemstvo all the benefits of that could possibly be derived from them in the wealthy kashinsky province which always took the lead of other provinces in everything there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy once carried through properly there might serve as a model for other provinces for all russia and hence the whole question was of the greatest importance it was proposed to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviiazhsky or better still neviedovsky a former university professor a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergei ivanovich 
 the meeting was opened by the governor who made a speech to the nobles urging them to elect the public functionaries not from regard for persons but for the service and welfare of the native country and hoping that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would as at all former elections hold their duty as sacred and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch 
 when he had finished his speech the governor walked out of the hall and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even enthusiastically followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province levin anxious to see into everything and not miss anything also stood there in the crowd and heard the governor say please tell marya ivanovna my wife is very sorry she could not visit the charity school and thereupon the nobles in high good humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral 
 in the cathedral levin lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the dean vowed with the most awesome oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do church services always affected levin and as he uttered the words i kiss the cross and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same he felt touched 
 on the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the high school for girls of no importance whatever as sergei ivanovich explained and levin busy seeing after his own affairs did not attend the meetings on the fourth day the auditing of the accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province and then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old the committee which had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order the marshal of the province got up thanked the nobility for their confidence and shed tears the nobles gave him a loud welcome and shook hands with him but at that instant a nobleman of sergei party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province one of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this then a small gentleman very but very venomous began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission and sergei ivanovich began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not and he developed this dilemma in detail sergei ivanovich was answered by the talker of the opposite party then sviiazhsky spoke and then the venomous gentleman again the discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he asked sergei ivanovich whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated sergei ivanovich answered 
 oh no an honest man but those methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of nobility affairs must be broken down 
 on the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals it was rather a stormy day in several districts in the selezniovsky district sviiazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot and he gave a dinner that evening

 on the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals it was rather a stormy day in several districts in the selezniovsky district sviiazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot and he gave a dinner that evening

 levin was standing rather far off a nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boots were creaking prevented him from hearing distinctly he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the venomous gentleman and then the voice of sviiazhsky they were disputing as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words liable to be called up for trial 
 the crowd parted to make way for sergei ivanovich approaching the table sergei ivanovich waiting till the venomous gentleman had finished speaking said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself and asked the secretary to find the act the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot 
 sergei ivanovich read the act and began to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout landowner with dyed mustache in a tight uniform that made the back of his neck bulge up interrupted him he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly 
 a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking 
 then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly but it was impossible to make out what he said 
 he was shouting for the very course sergei ivanovich had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order 
 a ballot a ballot whoever is a nobleman understands we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no checking of the accounts of the marshal not a cashier but not the point votes please what vileness shouted furious and violent voices on all sides looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words they expressed the most implacable hatred levin did not in the least understand what it was all about and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fliorov should be put to the vote he forgot as sergei ivanovich explained to him afterward this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure right to vote that to secure the recognition of right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act 
 and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life concluded sergei ivanovich but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar seeing the waiters busy washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wineglasses seeing their alert and vivacious faces levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he began walking up and down looking with pleasure at the waiters he particularly liked the way one waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold napkins properly levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose speciality it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic drew him away 
 please come konstantin dmitrievich he said your looking for you they are voting on the legal point 
 levin walked into the room received a white ball and followed his brother sergei ivanovich to the table where sviiazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it sergei ivanovich put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and making room for levin stopped levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergei ivanovich with the question where am i to put it he asked this softly at a moment when there was talking going on near so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard but the persons speaking paused and his improper question was overheard sergei ivanovich frowned 
 that is a matter for each own decision he said severely 
 several people smiled levin crimsoned hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand in too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background

 but the old party did not consider themselves conquered levin heard that they were asking snetkov to be candidate and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal who was saying something levin went nearer in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service several times he repeated the words i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him and went out of the room whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he was placed in feeling himself surrounded by enemies his emotion infected the assembly the majority were touched and levin felt a tenderness for snetkov 
 in the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against levin 
 beg pardon excuse me please he said as to a stranger but recognizing levin he smiled timidly it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something but could not speak for emotion his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses and white trousers striped with galloons as he moved hurriedly along reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil plight this expression on the face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his guardianship business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man the big house with the old family furniture the rather slovenly far from stylish but respectful footmen unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master the stout wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl petting her pretty grandchild her daughter the young son a high school boy coming home from school and greeting his father by kissing his big hand the genuine cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he longed to say something pleasant to him

 not likely said the marshal looking round with a scared expression old if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve 
 and the marshal disappeared through a side door 
 the most solemn moment was at hand they were to proceed immediately to the election the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers 
 the discussion upon fliorov had given the new party not only vote but had also gained time for them so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been relieved of his uniform 
 on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about fliorov to send some of their men in a cab to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting

 the narrow room in which they were smoking and taking refreshment was full of noblemen the excitement grew more intense and every face betrayed some uneasiness the excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party who knew every detail and had reckoned up every vote they were the generals organizing the approaching battle the rest like the rank and file before an engagement though they were getting ready for the fight sought for other distractions in the interval some were lunching standing at the bar or sitting at the table others were walking up and down the long room smoking cigarettes and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while 
 levin did not care to eat and he was not a smoker he did not want to join his own friends that is sergei ivanovich stepan arkadyevich sviiazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his uniform was standing with them in eager conversation levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him he felt depressed especially because everyone else was as he saw eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform who sat beside him had no interest in it and nothing to do 
 such a blackguard i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it he collect it in three years he heard vigorously uttered by a short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging over his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke casting a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turned his back 
 yes a dirty business no denying another puny landowner assented in a high voice 
 next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard 
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen pawned them for drink i expect damn the fellow prince indeed better not say it swinish 
 but excuse me they take their stand on the act was being said in another group the wife must be registered as a noble 
 oh damn your acts i speak from my heart all gentlemen we have trust in us 
 shall we go on your excellency fine champagne 
 another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something in a loud voice it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen 
 i always advised marya semionovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit he heard a pleasant voice say the speaker was a country gentleman with white mustache wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer it was the very landowner levin had met at he knew him at once the landowner too stared at levin and they exchanged greetings 
 very glad to see you to be sure i remember you very well last year at our district nikolai 
 well and how is your land doing asked levin 
 oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that it must be thus and how do you come to be in our province he asked come to take part in our coup he said confidently pronouncing the french words with a bad accent 
 all here gentlemen of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevich in white trousers and his court uniform walking by with a general 
 i ought to own that i very well understand the drift of the provincial elections said levin 
 the landowner looked at him 
 why what is there to understand no meaning in it at all a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia just look the very uniforms tell you that an assembly of justices of the peace permanent members of the boards and so on but not of noblemen 
 then why do you come asked levin 
 from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connections a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there are own interests my wants to run as a permanent member not rich people and he must be brought forward these gentlemen now what do they come for he said pointing to the venomous gentleman who was talking at the high table 
 the new generation of nobility 
 new it may be but nobility it landed proprietors but the landowners as noblemen cutting their own throats 
 but you say an institution served its time 
 that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but the growth of a thousand years if laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there a tree stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree you grow him again in a year he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation well and how is your estate doing 
 oh not very well i make about five per cent 
 yes but you reckon your own work you worth something too tell you my own case before i took to seeing after the land i had a salary of three thousand roubles from the service now i do more work than i did in the service and like you i get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but work is thrown in for nothing 
 then why do you do it if a clear loss 
 oh well one does it what would you have habit and one knows as it should be and more the landowner went on leaning on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it no doubt be a savant so be no one to keep it up and yet one does it here this year planted an orchard 
 yes yes said levin perfectly true i always feel no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one does it a sort of duty one feels to the land 
 but i tell you what the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place we walked about the fields and the park no said he stepan vassilyevich well looked after but your neglected but as a fact well kept up to my thinking cut down the linden trees only do it when running sap a thousand lindens and each would make two good bundles of bast and nowadays that worth something and cut down the lot of the linden shells 
 and with what he made buy up livestock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out to the peasants levin added smiling he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations and make his fortune but you and i must thank god if we keep what got and leave it to our children 
 married heard said the landowner 
 yes levin answered with proud satisfaction yes all this is rather strange he went on so we live on without any reckoning as though we were the vestals of antiquity set to guard a sacred fire or something 
 the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches 
 there are some among us too like our friend nikolai ivanovich or count vronsky settled here lately they try to set up an agronomic industry but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital 
 but why is it we do like the merchants why we cut down our parks for bast said levin returning to a thought that had struck him 
 why as you said to guard the fire besides not work for a nobleman and our work as noblemen done here at the elections but yonder each in his own nook a class instinct too of what one ought and to do there are the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can however bad the land is work it without a reckoning too at a simple loss 
 just as we do said levin very very glad to have met you he added seeing sviiazhsky approaching him 
 and here met for the first time since we met at your place said the landowner to sviiazhsky and had a good talk too 
 well have you been attacking the new order of things said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 that bound to do 
 been relieving your feelings

 levin did not care to eat and he was not a smoker he did not want to join his own friends that is sergei ivanovich stepan arkadyevich sviiazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his uniform was standing with them in eager conversation levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him he felt depressed especially because everyone else was as he saw eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform who sat beside him had no interest in it and nothing to do 
 such a blackguard i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it he collect it in three years he heard vigorously uttered by a short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging over his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke casting a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turned his back 
 yes a dirty business no denying another puny landowner assented in a high voice 
 next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard 
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen pawned them for drink i expect damn the fellow prince indeed better not say it swinish 
 but excuse me they take their stand on the act was being said in another group the wife must be registered as a noble 
 oh damn your acts i speak from my heart all gentlemen we have trust in us 
 shall we go on your excellency fine champagne 
 another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something in a loud voice it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen 
 i always advised marya semionovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit he heard a pleasant voice say the speaker was a country gentleman with white mustache wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer it was the very landowner levin had met at he knew him at once the landowner too stared at levin and they exchanged greetings 
 very glad to see you to be sure i remember you very well last year at our district nikolai 
 well and how is your land doing asked levin 
 oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that it must be thus and how do you come to be in our province he asked come to take part in our coup he said confidently pronouncing the french words with a bad accent 
 all here gentlemen of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevich in white trousers and his court uniform walking by with a general 
 i ought to own that i very well understand the drift of the provincial elections said levin 
 the landowner looked at him 
 why what is there to understand no meaning in it at all a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia just look the very uniforms tell you that an assembly of justices of the peace permanent members of the boards and so on but not of noblemen 
 then why do you come asked levin 
 from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connections a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there are own interests my wants to run as a permanent member not rich people and he must be brought forward these gentlemen now what do they come for he said pointing to the venomous gentleman who was talking at the high table 
 the new generation of nobility 
 new it may be but nobility it landed proprietors but the landowners as noblemen cutting their own throats 
 but you say an institution served its time 
 that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but the growth of a thousand years if laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there a tree stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree you grow him again in a year he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation well and how is your estate doing 
 oh not very well i make about five per cent 
 yes but you reckon your own work you worth something too tell you my own case before i took to seeing after the land i had a salary of three thousand roubles from the service now i do more work than i did in the service and like you i get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but work is thrown in for nothing 
 then why do you do it if a clear loss 
 oh well one does it what would you have habit and one knows as it should be and more the landowner went on leaning on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it no doubt be a savant so be no one to keep it up and yet one does it here this year planted an orchard 
 yes yes said levin perfectly true i always feel no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one does it a sort of duty one feels to the land 
 but i tell you what the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place we walked about the fields and the park no said he stepan vassilyevich well looked after but your neglected but as a fact well kept up to my thinking cut down the linden trees only do it when running sap a thousand lindens and each would make two good bundles of bast and nowadays that worth something and cut down the lot of the linden shells 
 and with what he made buy up livestock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out to the peasants levin added smiling he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations and make his fortune but you and i must thank god if we keep what got and leave it to our children 
 married heard said the landowner 
 yes levin answered with proud satisfaction yes all this is rather strange he went on so we live on without any reckoning as though we were the vestals of antiquity set to guard a sacred fire or something 
 the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches 
 there are some among us too like our friend nikolai ivanovich or count vronsky settled here lately they try to set up an agronomic industry but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital 
 but why is it we do like the merchants why we cut down our parks for bast said levin returning to a thought that had struck him 
 why as you said to guard the fire besides not work for a nobleman and our work as noblemen done here at the elections but yonder each in his own nook a class instinct too of what one ought and to do there are the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can however bad the land is work it without a reckoning too at a simple loss 
 just as we do said levin very very glad to have met you he added seeing sviiazhsky approaching him 
 and here met for the first time since we met at your place said the landowner to sviiazhsky and had a good talk too 
 well have you been attacking the new order of things said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 that bound to do 
 been relieving your feelings

 sviiazhsky took arm and went with him to his own friends this time there was no avoiding vronsky he was standing with stepan arkadyevich and sergei ivanovich and looking straight at levin as he drew near 
 delighted i believe had the pleasure of meeting you at princess he said giving levin his hand 
 yes i quite remember our meeting said levin and blushing crimson he turned away immediately and began talking to his brother 
 with a slight smile vronsky went on talking to sviiazhsky obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with levin but levin as he talked to his brother was continually looking round at vronsky trying to think of something to say to him to smooth over his rudeness 
 what are we waiting for now asked levin looking at sviiazhsky and vronsky 
 for snetkov he has to refuse or accept the candidacy answered sviiazhsky 
 well and what has he done consented or not 
 the point done neither said vronsky 
 and if he refuses who will run then asked levin looking at vronsky 
 whoever chooses to said sviiazhsky 
 shall you asked levin 
 certainly not i said sviiazhsky looking confused and turning an alarmed glance at the venomous gentleman who was standing beside sergei ivanovich 
 who then neviedovsky said levin feeling he was putting his foot into it 
 but this was worse still neviedovsky and sviiazhsky were the two candidates 
 i certainly shall not under any circumstances answered the venomous gentleman 
 this was neviedovsky himself sviiazhsky introduced him to levin 
 well do you find it exciting too said stepan arkadyevich winking at vronsky something like a race one might bet on it 
 yes it is keenly exciting said vronsky and once taking the thing up eager to see it through a fight he said scowling and setting his powerful jaws 
 what a businessman sviiazhsky is sees it all so clearly 
 oh yes vronsky assented indifferently 
 a silence followed during which vronsky since he had to look at something looked at levin at his feet at his frock coat then at his face and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him he said in order to say something 
 how is it that you living constantly in the country are not a justice of the peace you are not in the uniform of one 
 because i consider the justice of the peace a silly institution morosely answered levin who had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting 
 i think so quite the contrary vronsky said with calm surprise 
 a plaything levin cut him short we want justices of the peace never had a single thing to do with them during eight years and what i have had was decided wrongly by them the justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me for a matter of two roubles or so i should have to send a lawyer who costs me fifteen 
 and he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller and when the miller told him of it had lodged a complaint for slander all this was utterly and stupid and levin felt it himself as he said it 
 oh this is such an original fellow said stepan arkadyevich with his most soothing smile but come along i think voting 
 and they separated 
 i understand said sergei ivanovich who had observed his gaucherie i understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact where we russians are so deficient the marshal of the province is our opponent and with him ami cochon and you beg him to be candidate count vronsky now not making a friend of him asked me to dinner and not going but one of our side why make an enemy of him then you ask neviedovsky if going to run not done 
 oh i understand it at all and all such nonsense levin answered somberly 
 you say all such nonsense yet as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle 
 levin did not answer and they walked together into the big room 
 the marshal of the province though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him and though he had not been called upon by all to run had nevertheless made up his mind to run for office all was silence in the room the secretary announced in a loud voice that mikhail stepanovich snetkov captain of the guards would now be balloted for as marshal of the province 
 the district marshals walked carrying plates on which were balls from their tables to the province table and the election began 
 put it in the right side whispered stepan arkadyevich as levin with his brother followed the marshal of his district to the table but levin had forgotten by now the machination that had been explained to him and was afraid stepan arkadyevich might be mistaken in saying the right side surely snetkov was the enemy as he went up he held the ball in his right hand but thinking he was wrong just at the box he changed to the left hand and undoubtedly put the ball to the left an adept in the business standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball scowled with annoyance it was no good for him to use his insight 
 everything was still and the counting of the balls was heard then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against 
 the marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority all was noise and eager movement toward the doors snetkov came in and the nobles thronged round him congratulating him 
 well now is it over levin asked sergei ivanovich 
 only just beginning sviiazhsky said replying for sergei ivanovich with a smile some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal 
 levin had quite forgotten about that again now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it but he was too bored to think what it was exactly he felt depressed and longed to get out of the crowd 
 as no one was paying any attention to him and no one apparently needed him he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters the little old waiter pressed him to have something and levin agreed after eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters levin not wishing to go back to the hall where it was all so distasteful to him proceeded to walk through the galleries 
 the galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below with the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers high school teachers in spectacles and officers everywhere they were talking of the election and of how worried the marshal was and how splendid the discussions had been in one group levin heard his praises one lady was telling a lawyer 
 how glad i am i heard koznishev worth missing lunch exquisite so clear and distinct all of it not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that the only one is meidel and very far from being so eloquent 
 finding a free place levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening 
 all the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts in the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform who shouted in a loud high voice 
 as a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff captain eugenii ivanovich apukhtin a dead silence followed and then a weak old voice was heard 
 declined 
 we call upon the privy councilor piotr petrovich bol the voice began again 
 declined a high boyish voice replied 
 again it began and again came the declined and so it went on for about an hour levin with his elbows on the balustrade looked and listened at first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces he felt sad he made up his mind to go and went downstairs as he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with eyes on the stairs he met a couple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor 
 i told you you late the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when levin moved aside to let the lady pass 
 levin was on the stairs to the way out and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for his overcoat check when the secretary overtook him this way please konstantin dmitrievich they are voting 
 the candidate who was being voted on was neviedovsky who had so stoutly denied all idea of candidacy 
 levin went up to the door of the room it was locked the secretary knocked the door opened and levin was met by two gentlemen who darted out 
 i stand any more of it said one gentleman 
 after them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out his face was from exhaustion and dismay 
 i told you not to let anyone out he cried to the doorkeeper 
 i let someone in your excellency 
 mercy on us and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room his legs wavering from fatigue 
 neviedovsky had scored a higher majority as they had planned and he was the new marshal of the province many people were amused many were pleased and happy many were in ecstasies many were disgusted and unhappy the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair which he could not conceal when neviedovsky went out of the room the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically just as they had followed the governor on the first day when he had opened the meetings and just as they had followed snetkov when he had been elected
