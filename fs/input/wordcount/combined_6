 dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom for it asketh a strong wit 
 and a strong heart to know when to tell truth and to do it therefore it is me weaker sort of politics that are the great dissemblers 
 tacitus saith livia sorted well with the arts of her husband and dissimulation 
 of her son attributing arts or policy to augustus and dissimulation to tiberius 
 and again when lucianus encourageth vespasian to take arms against vitellius he saith we rise not against the piercing judgment of augustus nor the extreme caution or closeness of tiberius these properties of arts or policy and dissimulation or closeness are indeed habits and faculties several and to be distinguished for if a man have that penetration of judgment as he can discern what things are to be laid open and what to be secreted and what to be showed at half lights and to whom and when which indeed are arts of state and arts of life as tacitus well calleth mem to him a habit of dissimulation is a hindrance and a poorness but if a man cannot obtain to that judgment then it is left to him generally to be close and a dissembler for where a man cannot choose or vary in particulars there it is good to take the safest and wariest way in general like the going softly by one that cannot well see certainly the ablest men that ever were have had all an openness and frankness of dealing and a name of certainty and veracity but then they were like horses well managed for they could tell passing well when to stop or turn and at such times when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation if then they used it it came to pass that me former opinion spread abroad of their good faith and clearness of dealing made them almost invisible 
 there be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a self the first closeness reservation and secrecy when a man leaveth himself without 
 observation or without hold to be taken what he is the second dissimulation in the negative when a man lets fall signs and arguments that he is not that he is and the third simulation in the affirmative when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be that he is not 
 for the first of these secrecy it is indeed the virtue of a confessor and assuredly the secret man heareth many confessions for who will open himself to a blab or a babbler but if a man be thought secret it inviteth discovery as the more close air sucketh in the more open and as in confession the revealing is not for worldly use but for the ease of a heart so secret men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind while men rather discharge their minds than impart their minds in few words mysteries are due to secrecy besides to say truth nakedness is uncomely as well in mind as body and it addeth no small reverence to manners and actions if they be not altogether open as for talkers and futile persons they are commonly vain and credulous withal for he that talketh what he knoweth will also talk what he knoweth not therefore set it down that an habit of secrecy is both politic and moral and in this part it is good that a face give his tongue leave to speak for the discovery of a self by the tracts of his countenance 
 is a great weakness and betraying by how much it is many times more marked and believed than a words 
 for the second which is dissimulation it followeth many times upon secrecy by a necessity so that he that will be secret must be a dissembler in some degree for men are too cunning to suffer a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both and to be secret without swaying the balance on either side they will so beset a man with questions and draw him on and pick it out of him that without an absurd silence he must show an inclination one way or if he do not they will gather as much by his silence as by his speech as for equivocations or oraculous speeches they cannot hold out long so that no man can be secret except he give himself a little scope of dissimulation which is as it were but the skirts or train of secrecy 
 but for the third degree which is simulation and false profession mat i hold more culpable and less politic except it be in great and rare matters 
 and therefore a general custom of simulation which is this last degree is a vice 
 rising either of a natural falseness or tearfulness or of a mind that hath some 
 main faults which because a man must needs disguise it maketh him practise 
 simulation in other things lest his hand should be out of use 
 
 the great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three first to lay asleep opposition and to surprise for where a intentions are published it is an alarum to call up all that are against them the second is to reserve to a self a fair retreat for if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration he must go through or take a fall the third is the better to discover the mind of another for to him that opens himself men will hardly show themselves adverse but will fair let him go on and turn their freedom of speech to freedom of thought 
 and therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the spaniard tell a lie and find a troth as if there were no way of discovery but by simulation there be also three disadvantages to set it even the first that simulation and dissimulation commonly cany with them a show of fearfulness which in any business doth spoil the feathers of round flying up to the mark the second that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many that perhaps would otherwise cooperate with him and makes a man walk almost alone to his own ends the third and greatest is mat it depriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action which is trust and belief the best composition and temperature is to have openness in fame and opinion secrecy in habit dissimulation in seasonable use and a power to feign if there be no remedy

 book just man 
 chapter v 
 
 monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long 
 the private life of m myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life 
 the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand 
 like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little this brief slumber was profound 
 in the morning he meditated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows 
 then he set to work 
 a bishop is a very busy man 
 he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine diocesan catechisms books of hours to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business 
 what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work sometimes he dug in his garden again he read or wrote 
 he had but one word for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening the mind is a garden said he 
 towards when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long cane clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points 
 it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared 
 one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun 
 he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him they pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything 
 here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers 
 he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the rich 
 as he made his cassocks last a long while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak 
 this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer 
 on his return he dined 
 the dinner resembled his breakfast 
 at eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table nothing could be more frugal than this repast 
 if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains 
 every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal 
 the bishop did not interfere with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup 
 thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure he indulges in the cheer of a trappist 
 after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio he was a man of letters and rather learned 
 he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated upon the waters 
 with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew upon the face of the waters in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century under the pseudonym of barleycourt 
 sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself 
 these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them 
 we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admirals on the american station 
 versailles poincot and paris pissot bookseller quai des augustins 
 here is the note 
 oh you who are 
 ecclesiastes calls you the the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you god man calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names 
 toward nine in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor 
 it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d

 the mad 
 joe opens the other door closing it carefully behind him and dials the in the small foyer someone comes in from the front door and joe watches him nervously until the man goes into the office

 hennessy

 joe 
 walking over he leans on the side of his desk 
 how much would a real interview with this dame be worth

 hennessy

 joe 
 dollars 
 
 hennessy 
 dollars 
 
 joe 
 talking about her views on everything 
 
 dramatically walking over to the front of desk

 the monster looked very much like and old man he was clad in a shabbycloak and loose robes hung with a few small straps packs and unrecognizableinstruments artoo searched the wake but detected no evidence of apursuing nightmare nor did the man appear threatened actually artoo looked kind of pleased 
 it was impossible to tell where the odd overlapping attire ended and hisskin began that aged visage blended into the cloth and his beardappeared but an extension of the loose threads covering his upper chest 
 hints of extreme climates other than desert of ultimate cold and humidity wereetched into that seamed face a questing beak of nose like a high rock protrudedoutward from a flashflood of wrinkles and scars the eyes bordering it were a liquidcrystalazure the man smiled through sand and dust and beard squinting at the sightof the crumpled form lying quietly alongside of the landspeeder 
 convinced that the sandpeople had been the victims of an auditory delusion ofsome ignoring the fact that he had experienced it assured that this stranger meant luke no harm artoo shifted his positionslightly trying to obtain a better view the sound produced by a tiny pebble hedislodged was barely perceptible to his electronic sensors but the man whirled as ifshot he stared straight at alcove still smiling gently 
 hello there he called in a deep surprisingly cheerful voice come here mylittle friend no need to be afraid 
 something forthright and reassuring was in that voice in any case theassociation of an unknown human was preferable to remaining isolated in thiswasteland waddling out into the sunlight artoo made his way over to whereluke lay sprawled the body inclined forward as he examinedthe limp form whistles and beeps of concern came from within 
 walking over the old man bent beside luke and reached out to touch hisforehead then his temple shortly the unconscious youth was stirring andmumbling like a dreaming sleeper 
 worry the human told artoo be all right 
 as if to confirm this opinion luke blinked stared upward muttered what happened 
 rest easy son the man instructed him as he sat back on his heels a busy day again the boyish grin mighty lucky your stillattached to the rest of you 
 luke looked around his gaze coming to rest on the elderly face hovering abovehim recognition did wonders for his condition 
 got to be a sudden remembrance made him look around there was no sign of sandpeople slowly he raised his body to a sitting kenobiam i glad to see you 
 rising the old man surveyed the canyon floor and rolling rimwall above onefoot played with the sand the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly misguided traveler who tempts the hospitality his gaze went back tohis patient tell me young man what brings you out this far into nowhere 
 luke indicated artoo detoo this little droid for a while i thought crazy claiming he was searching for a former master now i think never seen such devotion in a or otherwise there seems tobe no stopping him he even resorted to tricking me 
 gaze shifted upward he claims to be the property of someone kenobi luke watched closely but the man showed no reaction is that arelative of yours my uncle thinks he was a real person or is it just someunimportant bit of scrambled information that got shifted into his primaryperformance bank 
 an introspective frown did remarkable things to that sandlbasted face kenobiappeared to ponder the question scratching absently at his scruffy beard he recited a name i heard in a long long time most curious 
 my uncle said he was dead luke supplied helpfully 
 oh not dead kenobi corrected him easily not yet not yet 
 luke climbed excitedly to his feet all thoughts of tusken raiders forgotten know him then 
 a smile of perverse youthfulness split that collage of wrinkled skin and course i know him me just as you probably suspected luke i by the name though since before you were born 
 then luke essayed gesturing at artoo detoo this droid does belong to he claims 
 now the peculiar part an openly puzzled kenobi confessed regardingthe silent robot i seem to remember owning a droid least of all a modernartoo unit most interesting most interesting 
 something drew the old gaze suddenly to the brow of nearby cliffs ithink best we make use of your landspeeder some the sandpeople are easilystartled but soon return in greater numbers a not a prizereadily conceded and after all jawas not 
 placing both hands over his mouth in a peculiar fashion kenobi inhaled deeplyand let out an unearthly howl that made luke jump that ought to keep anylaggards running for a while yet the old man concluded with satisfaction 
 a krayt dragon call luke gaped in astonishment how did you dothat 
 show you sometime son not too hard just takes the right attitude aset of vocal cords and a lot of wind now if you were an imperialbureaucrat i could teach you right off but not he scanned the and i think this is the time or place for it 
 i argue that luke was rubbing at the back of his head getstarted 
 that was when artoo let out a pathetic beep and whirled luke the electronic squeal but he suddenly comprehended the reason behind luke exclaimed worriedly artoo was already moving as fast aspossible away from the landspeeder come on ben 
 the little robot led them to the edge of a large sandpit it stopped downward and squeaking mournfully luke saw where artoo was started cautiously down the smooth shifting slope while kenobi followedeffortlessly 
 threepio lay in the sand at the base of the slope down which he had rolled andtumbled his casing was dented and badly mangled one arm lay broken and benta short distance away 
 threepio luke called there was no response shaking the droid failed toactivate anything opening a plate on the back luke flipped a hidden switchon and off several times in succession a low hum started stopped started then dropped to a normal purr 
 using his remaining arm threepio rolled over and sat up where am i hemurmured as his photoreceptors continued to clear then he recognized sorry sir i must have taken a bad step 
 lucky any of your main circuits are still operational luke informedhim he looked significantly toward the top of the hill can you stand to get out of here before the sandpeople return 
 servomotors whined in protest until threepio ceased struggling i thinki can make it you go on master luke it make sense to risk yourself onmy account finished 
 no not luke shot back unaccountably affected by this recentlyencountered machine but then threepio was not the usual device luke was accustomed to dealing with what kind of talk isthat 
 logical threepio informed him 
 luke shook his head angrily defeatist 
 with luke and ben aid the battered droid somehow managed tostruggle erect little artoo watched from the rim 
 hesitating part way up the slope kenobi sniffed the air suspiciously on the move again 
 trying to watch the surrounding rocks and his footsteps simultaneously lukefought to drag threepio clear of the pit 
 the dcor of ben cave was spartan without appearinguncomfortable it would not have suited most people reflecting as it did eclectic tastes the living area radiated an aura of lean comfort with moreimportance attached to mental comforts than those of the awkward human body 
 they had succeeded in vacating the canyon before the tusken raiders couldreturn in force under direction luke left a trail behind them so confusingthat not even a hypernasal jawa could have followed it 
 luke spent several hours ignoring the temptations of cave instead heremained in the corner which was equipped as a compact yet complete repair to fix severed arm 
 fortunately the automatic overload disconnects had given way under the severestrain sealing electronic nerves and ganglia without real damage repair wasmerely a matter of reattaching the limb to the shoulder then activating the the arm been broken in instead of at a joint such repairs would havebeen impossible save at a factory shop 
 while luke was thus occupied attention was concentrated on artoodetoo the squat droid sat passively on the cool cavern floor while the old manfiddled with its metal insides finally the man sat back with a humph ofsatisfaction and closed the open panels in the rounded head now seeif we can figure out what you are my little friend and where you came from 
 luke was almost finished anyway and words were sufficient to pullhim away from the repair area i saw part of the message he began and i 
 once more the striking portrait was being projected into empty space from thefront of the little robot luke broke off enraptured by its enigmatic beauty onceagain 
 yes i think got it kenobi murmured contemplatively 
 the image continued to flicker indicating a tape hastily prepared but it wasmuch sharper better defined now luke noted with admiration one thing wasapparent kenobi was skilled in subjects more specific than desert scavenging 
 general kenobi the mellifluous voice was saying i present myselfin the name of the world family of alderaan and of the alliance to restore therepublic i break your solitude at the bidding of my father bail organa viceroyand first chairman of the alderaan system 
 kenobi absorbed this extraordinary declamation while eyes bugged bigenough to fall from his face 
 years ago general the voice continued you served the old republic in theclone wars now my father begs you to aid us again in our most desperate would have you join him on alderaan you must go to him 
 i regret that i am unable to present my request to you in person mymission to meet personally with you has failed hence i have been forced to resortto this secondary method of communication 
 information vital to the survival of the alliance has been secured in the mind ofthis detoo droid my father will know how to retrieve it i plead with you to seethis unit safely delivered to alderaan 
 she paused and when she continued her words were hurried and less laced withformality you must help me kenobi you are my last hope i will becaptured by agents of the empire they will learn nothing from me everything tobe learned lies locked in the memory cells of this droid do not fail us do not fail me 
 a small cloud of tridimensional static replaced the delicate portrait and then itvanished entirely artoo detoo gazed up expectantly at kenobi 
 mind was as muddy as a pond laced with petroleum unanchored histhoughts and eyes turned for stability to the quiet figure seated nearby 
 the old man the crazy wizard the desert bum and characterswhom his uncle and everyone else had known of for as long as luke could recall 
 if the breathless message the unknown woman had just spokeninto the cool air of the cave had affected kenobi in any way he gave no hint of he leaned back against the rock wall and tugged thoughtfully at his slowly on a water pipe of tarnished chrome 
 luke visualized that simple yet lovely portrait his farmingbackground provide him with the requisite words suddenly something in themessage caused him to stare disbelievingly at the oldster general kenobi youfought in the clone wars butthat was so long ago 
 um yes kenobi acknowledged as casually as he might have discussed therecipe for shang stew i guess it was a while back i was a jedi knight he added watching the youth appraisingly your father 
 a jedi knight luke echoed then he looked confused but my fight in the clone wars he was no a navigator on a spacefreighter 
 smile enfolded the mouthpiece or so your uncle has toldyou his attention was suddenly focused elsewhere owen lars agreewith your ideas opinions or with his philosophy of life he believed thatyour father should have stayed here on tatooine and not gotten involved the seemingly indifferent shrug well he thought he should have remainedhere and minded his farming 
 luke said nothing his body tense as the old man related bits and pieces of apersonal history luke had viewed only through his distortions 
 owen was always afraid that your adventurous life might influence pull you away from anchorhead he shook his head slowly regretfully atthe remembrance afraid there much of the farmer in your father 
 luke turned away he returned to cleaning the last particles of sand healing armature i wish known him he finally whispered 
 he was the best pilot i ever knew kenobi went on and a smart fighter theforcethe instinct was strong in him for a brief second kenobi actually appearedold he was also a good friend 
 suddenly the boyish twinkle returned to those piercing eyes along with the natural humor i understand quite a pilot yourself piloting andnavigation hereditary but a number of the things that can combine to make agood pilot are those you may have inherited still even a duck has tobe taught to swim 
 a duck luke asked curiously 
 never mind in many ways you know you are much like your unabashed look of evaluation made luke nervous grown upquite a bit since the last time i saw you 
 having no reply for that luke waited silently as kenobi sank back into deepcontemplation after a while the old man stirred evidently having reached animportant decision 
 all this reminds me he declared with deceptive casualness i have somethinghere for you he rose and walked over to a bulky chest and startedrummaging through it all sorts of intriguing items were removed and shovedaround only to be placed back in the bin a few of them luke recognized askenobi was obviously intent on something important he forbore inquiring about anyof the other tantalizing flotsam 
 when you were old enough kenobi was saying your father want you to havethisif i can ever find the blasted device i tried to give it to you once before butyour uncle allow it he believed you might get some crazy ideas from itand end up following old on some idealistic crusade 
 you see luke where your father and your uncle owen disagreed larsis not a man to let idealism interfere with business whereas your father thinkthe question even worth discussing his decision on such matters came like 
 luke nodded he finished picking out the last of the grit and looked around forone remaining component to snap back in open chest plate locating therestraining module he opened the receiving latches in the machine and set aboutlocking it back in place threepio watched the process and appeared to wince everso perceptibly 
 luke stared into those metal and plastic photoreceptors for a long he set the module pointedly on the workbench and closed the droid said nothing 
 a grunt came from behind them and luke turned to see a pleased kenobiwalking over he handed luke a small device which the youthstudied with interest 
 it consisted primarily of a short thick handgrip with a couple of small switchesset into the grip above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger indiameter than his spread palm a number of unfamiliar components werebuilt into both handle and disk including what looked like the smallest power cellluke had ever seen the reverse side of the disk was polished to a mirror it was the power cell that puzzled luke the most whatever the thing was itrequired a great deal of energy according to the rating form of the cell 
 despite the claim that it had belonged to his father the gizmo looked newlymanufactured kenobi had obviously kept it carefully only a number of minutescratches on the handgrip hinted at previous usage 
 sir came a familiar voice luke heard in a while 
 what luke was startled out of his examination 
 if not be needing me threepio declared i think shut down for a will help the armature nerves to knit and due for some internal 
 sure go ahead luke said absently returning to his fascinated study of behind him threepio became silent the glow fading temporarilyfrom his eyes luke noticed that kenobi was watching him with interest what isit he finally asked unable despite his best efforts to identify the device 
 your lightsaber kenobi told him at one time they were widelyused still are in certain galactic quarters 
 luke examined the controls on the handle then tentatively touched a brightlycolored button up near the mirrored pommel instantly the disk put forth a beam as thick around as his thumb it was dense to the point of opacity and alittle over a meter in length it did not fade but remained as brilliant and intense atits far end as it did next to the disk strangely luke felt no heat from it though hewas very careful not to touch it he knew what a lightsaber could do though he hadnever seen one before it could drill a hole right through the rock wall of through a human being 
 this was the formal weapon of a jedi knight explained kenobi not asclumsy or random as a blaster more skill than simple sight was required for its elegant weapon it was a symbol as well anyone can use a blaster to use a lightsaber well was a mark of someone a cut above theordinary he was pacing the floor of the cave as he spoke 
 for over a thousand generations luke the jedi knights were the most respected force in the galaxy they served as the guardians and guarantors ofpeace and justice in the old republic 
 when luke failed to ask what had happened to them since kenobi looked up tosee that the youth was staring vacantly into space having absorbed little if any of instruction some men would have chided luke for not paying kenobi more sensitive than most he waited patiently until the silence weighedstrong enough on luke for him to resume speaking 
 how he asked slowly did my father die 
 kenobi hesitated and luke sensed that the old man had no wish to talk aboutthis particular matter unlike owen lars however kenobi was unable to takerefuge in a comfortable lie 
 he was betrayed and murdered kenobi declared solemnly by a very youngjedi named darth vader he was not looking at luke a boy i was of my brightest disciplesone of my greatest failures 
 kenobi resumed his pacing vader used the training i gave him and the forcewithin him for evil to help the later corrupt emperors with the jedi knightsdisbanded disorganized or dead there were few to oppose vader today they areall but extinct 
 an indecipherable expression crossed face in many ways they weretoo good too trusting for their own health they put too much trust in the stabilityof the republic failing to realize that while the body might be sound the head wasgrowing diseased and feeble leaving it open to manipulation by such as the emperor 
 i wish i knew what vader was after sometimes i have the feeling he ismarking time in preparation for some incomprehensible abomination such is thedestiny of one who masters the force and is consumed by its dark side 
 face twisted in confusion a force the second time a force 
 kenobi nodded i forget sometimes in whose presence i babble let us saysimply that the force is something a jedi must deal with while it has never beenproperly explained scientists have theorized it is an energy field generated by livingthings early man suspected its existence yet remained in ignorance of its potentialfor millennia 
 only certain individuals could recognize the force for what it was they weremercilessly labeled charlatans fakers worse even fewer could makeuse of it as it was usually beyond their primitive controls it frequently was toopowerful for them they were misunderstood by their worse 
 kenobi made a wide all encompassing gesture with both arms the forcesurrounds each and every one of us some men believe it directs our actions and notthe other way around knowledge of the force and how to manipulate it was whatgave the jedi his special power 
 the arms came down and kenobi stared at luke until the youth began to fidgetuncomfortably when he spoke again it was in a tone so crisp and unaged that lukejumped in spite of himself you must learn the ways of the force also are to come with me to alderaan 
 alderaan luke hopped off the repair seat looking dazed not going toalderaan i even know where alderaan is vaporators droids the surroundings seemed to close in on him the formerly intriguingfurnishings and alien artifacts now just a mite frightening he looked around to avoid the piercing gaze of ben kenobiold bencrazy bengeneral 
 got to get back home he found himself muttering thickly in for it as it is remembering something he gestured toward the motionlessbulk of artoo detoo you can keep the droid he seems to want you to of something to tell my hope he added forlornly 
 i need your help luke kenobi explained his manner a combination ofsadness and steel getting too old for this kind of thing trust myself tofinish it properly on my own this mission is far too important he noddedtoward artoo detoo you heard and saw the message 
 buti get involved with anything like that protested luke gotwork to do got crops to bring though uncle owen could alwaysbreak down and hire a little extra help i mean one i guess but nothing ican do about it not now besides all such a long way from here thewhole thing is really none of my business 
 that sounds like your uncle talking kenobi observed without rancor 
 oh my uncle owenhow am i going to explain all this to him 
 the old man suppressed a smile aware that destiny had already beendetermined for him it had been ordained five minutes before he had learned aboutthe manner of his death it had been ordered before that when he had heardthe complete message it had been fixed in the nature of things when he had firstviewed the pleading portrait of the beautiful senator organa awkwardly projected bythe little droid kenobi shrugged inwardly likely it had been finalized evenbefore the boy was born not that ben believed in predestination but he did believein in the force 
 remember luke the suffering of one man is the suffering of all distancesare irrelevant to injustice if not stopped soon enough evil eventually reaches out toengulf all men whether they have opposed it or ignored it 
 i suppose luke confessed nervously i could take you as far as can get transport from there to mos eisley or wherever it is you want to go 
 very well agreed kenobi that will do for a beginning then you must dowhat you feel is right 
 luke turned away now thoroughly confused okay right now i feeltoo good 
 the holding hole was deathly dim with only the bare minimum of illuminationprovided there was barely enough to see the black metal walls and the high ceilingoverhead the cell was designed to maximize a feelings of this it achieved well so much so that the single occupant started tensely as ahum came from one end of the chamber the metal door which began moving asidewas as thick as her if she mused bitterly they were afraid she might breakthrough anything less massive with her bare hands 
 straining to see outside the girl saw several imperial guards assume positionsjust outside the doorway eyeing them defiantly leia organa backed up against thefar wall 
 her determined expression collapsed as soon as a monstrous black form enteredthe room gliding smoothly as if on treads presence crushed her spirit asthoroughly as an elephant would crush an eggshell that villain was followed by anantiqued whip of a man who was only slightly less terrifying despite his minisculeappearance alongside the dark lord 
 darth vader made a gesture to someone outside something that hummed like ahuge bee moved close and slipped inside the doorway leia choked on her ownbreath at the sight of the dark metal globe it hung suspended on independentrepulsors a farrago of metal arms protruding from its sides the arms were tippedwith a multitude of delicate instruments 
 leia studied the contraption fearfully she had heard rumors of such had never really believed that imperial technicians would construct such amonstrosity incorporated into its soulless memory was every barbarity everysubstantiated outrage known to to several alien races as well 
 vader and tarkin stood there quietly giving her plenty of time to study thehovering nightmare the governor in particular did not delude himself into thinkingthat the mere presence of the device would shock her into giving up the informationhe needed not he reflected that the ensuing session would be especiallyunpleasant there was always enlightenment and knowledge to be gained from suchencounters and the senator promised to be a most interesting subject 
 after a suitable interval had passed he motioned to the machine organa princess organa we will discuss the location of the principal rebelbase 
 the machine moved slowly toward her traveling on a rising hum itsindifferent spherical form blocked out vader the governor the rest of the cellthelight 
 muffled sounds penetrated the cell walls and thick door drifting out into thehallway beyond they barely intruded on the peace and quiet of the walkwayrunning past the sealed chamber even so the guards stationed immediately outsidemanaged to find excuses to edge a sufficient distance away to where those oddlymodulated sounds could no longer be heard at all

 book one 
 chapter vi 
 
 having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave 
 pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it all his and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre 
 when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital fellow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this 
 prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass 
 go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess taking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a low voice 
 anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess 
 i rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir and she left the hall 
 prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper something 
 two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh 
 i am very glad i did not go to the said prince hippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful 
 they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there 
 not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing her 
 still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seem 
 are you ready he asked his wife looking past her 
 prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage 
 princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet 
 the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under pretense of helping was in way 
 allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path 
 i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and affectionately 
 the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home 
 well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing 
 do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch 
 hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to know how to deal with them 
 pierre reaching the house first went into prince study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle 
 what have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands 
 pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand 
 that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power 
 it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation 
 one everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence 
 pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him 
 really i yet know i like either the one or the other 
 but you must decide on something your father expects it 
 pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead 
 but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening 
 that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us talk business have you been to the horse guards 
 no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right 
 prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at childish words he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question 
 if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars he said 
 and that would be splendid said pierre 
 prince andrew smiled ironically 
 very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about 
 well why are you going to the war asked pierre 
 what for i know i must besides that i am going he paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me

 chapter 
 
 mr hindley came home to the funeral thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and brought a wife with him what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father 
 she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the children and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands and asking repeatedly are they gone yet then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell when i asked what was the matter answered she know but she felt so afraid of dying i imagined her as little likely to die as myself she was rather thin but young and and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds i did remark to be sure that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathize with her we in general take to foreigners here mr lockwood unless they take to us first 
 young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen and leave the house for him indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delf case and dog kennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention 
 she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish hindley became tyrannical a few words from her evincing a dislike to heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm 
 heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging and catherine a fast from dinner or supper but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors and swore nobody should let them in that night the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr earnshaw by knocking there was heathcliff by himself it gave me a start to see him alone 
 where is miss catherine i cried hurriedly no accident i hope 
 at thrushcross grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay well you will catch it i said never be content till sent about your business what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange 
 let me get off my wet clothes and tell you all about it nelly he replied i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he and i escaped from the to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange lights we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eyes out before the fire do you think they do or reading sermons and being catechized by their manservant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they answer properly 
 probably not i responded they are good children no doubt and deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct 
 you cant nelly he said nonsense we ran from the top of the heights to the park without completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot have to seek for her shoes in the bog tomorrow we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the window the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we it was splendid place carpeted with crimson and chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers old mr and mrs linton were not there edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves they have been happy we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good children were doing believe she is eleven a year younger than screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running needles into her edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them the idiots that was their pleasure to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for edgar at thrushcross if i might have the privilege of off the highest gable and painting the with blood 
 hush hush i interrupted still you have not told me heathcliff how catherine is left behind 
 i told you we laughed he answered the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma oh papa oh mamma come here oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee i had cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down run heathcliff run she whispered they have let the bulldog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle nelly i heard his abominable snorting she did not yell she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a store and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last fast skulker keep fast he changed his note he saw game the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver the man took cathy up she was sick not from fear certain but from pain he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance what prey robert hallooed linton from the entrance skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease hold your tongue you thief you you shall go to the gallows for this mr linton sir lay by your gun no no robert said the old fool the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day they thought to have me cleverly come in furnish them a reception there john fasten the chain give skulker some water jenny to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here be afraid it is but a the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror the cowardly children crept nearer also isabella thing put him in the cellar papa exactly like the son of the that stole my tame pheasant he edgar 
 while they examined me cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed edgar linton after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognize her they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere miss earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten her foot bleeds 
 miss earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in it she may be lamed for life 
 what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr linton turning from me to catherine understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to little lascar or an american or spanish castaway 
 a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton shocked that my children should have heard it 
 i recommenced be angry so robert was ordered to take me off i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again the curtains were still looped up at one comer and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out she sat on the sofa quietly mrs linton took off the grey cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine then the brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the dim reflection from her own enchanting face i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to everybody on earth is she not nelly 
 there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light you are incurable heathcliff and mr hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he my words came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious and then mr linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs earnshaw undertook to keep her in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible

 chapter six 
 
 the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions old mr laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater 
 all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionshipof these girls never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches 
 never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterward said the old gentleman the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise i suspect she is right and that been coddling the fellow as if been his grandmother let him do what he likes as long as he is happy he get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs march is doing more for him than we can 
 what good times they had to be sure such plays and tableaux such sleigh rides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style 
 but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she never told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano no persuasions orenticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and toldsuch charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr laurence talked on about lessons and teachers and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs march 
 the boy neglects his music now and glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know 
 beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile 
 they see or speak to anyone but run in at any time for shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine 
 here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way 
 oh sir they do care very very much are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly 
 beth i love it dearly and come if you are quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke 
 not a soul my dear the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged toyou 
 how kind you are sir 
 beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed herr saying in a tone few people ever heard 
 i had a little girl once with eyes like these god bless you my dear good day madam and away he went in a great hurry 
 beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not home how blithely she sang that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the side door and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend 
 she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude 
 after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen she never knew that mr laurence opened his study door to hear the airs he liked she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her at any rate she deserved both mother going to work mr laurence a pair of slippers he is so kind to me i must thank him and i know any other way can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his 
 yes dear it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs march who took peculiar pleasure in granting requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself 
 after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun a cluster ofgrave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before anyone got tired of them then she wrote a short simple note and with help got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up 
 when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen all day passed a a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed 
 a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it 
 oh beth sent you began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window 
 beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinet piano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a sign board to miss elizabeth march 
 for me gasped beth holding onto jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether 
 yes all for you my precious it splendid of him you think the dearest old man in the world the key in the letter we open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note 
 you read it i i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in apron quite upset by her present 
 jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first worked she saw were 
 miss march 
 dear madam 
 how nice it sounds i wish someone would write to me so said amy who thought the address very elegant 
 i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continues jo heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant 
 james laurence 
 there beth an honor to be proud of sure laurie told me how fond used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully just think given you her piano that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before 
 see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green sild puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties 
 your humble servant james laurence only think of his writing that to you tell the girls think splendid said amy much impressed by the note 
 try it honey hear the sound of the baby pianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows 
 so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard it had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple pie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals 
 have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the really going never entered her head 
 yes i mean to i guess go no before i get frightened thinking about it and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door 
 well i wish i may die if it the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle 
 they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward if you will believe me she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for but she finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him 
 if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman have been more astonished but he liked it oh dear yes he liked it amazingly and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little grand daughter back again beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was 
 when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end

 friend suffered the the 
 worst of all ancient egyptian 
 curses one reserved for only 
 the most evil blasphemers in 
 all of my research never 
 read of this curse actually 
 having been performed 
 
 that bad huh 
 evelyn 
 yes they never used it because 
 they feared it so written 
 that if a victim of the 
 should ever arise he would bring 
 with him the ten plagues of egypt 
 
 the ten plagues you mean all 
 ten plagues 
 beni 
 like what that moses guy did 
 to that pharaoh guy

 locusts 
 burns 
 hail and fire

 nervously walking around the desk sitting on the corner 
 the youth of the world must lead the way to a better

 world 
 
 hennessy 
 
 
 sliding it back

 joe 
 he pauses blankly 
 oh you mean what did she have on 
 
 hennessy 
 chuckling

 joe nervously adjusts his collar getting up off the desk again 
 er the matter is it a little warm in here for you 
 
 joe 
 walking back to the front of the desk

 joe 
 the one the one hennessy smiling sitting back in agreement it yeah i know exactly how to describe it but it yeah 
 
 hennessy 
 i think you described it very well 
 
 his expression changes as he sits forward standing up dramatically 
 in view of the fact that her highness was taken violently ill at three this morning put to bed with a high fever and has had all her appointments for today cancelled in toto 
 
 joe 
 helplessly 
 in toto 
 
 hennessy

 all over the front page of every newspaper in rome 
 
 he hands him the paper 
 
 joe

 hennessy 
 if you ever get up early enough to read a morning paper you might discover little news events 
 
 pointing to the article in the paper 
 little items of general interest 
 
 joe looks at the paper and stares at the picture of the same woman as in his apartment but in a regal gown necklace and tiara 
 that might prevent you in the future from getting immersed in such a lies as you have just told me

 chapter 
 
 for the love of a man 
 
 
 
 when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of for dawson he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him and here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature buck slowly won back his strength 
 a rest comes very good after one has traveled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones for that matter they were all john thornton and skeet and for the raft to come that was to carry them down to dawson skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed wounds regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog and with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature 
 to surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence love genuine passionate love was his for the first time this he had never experienced at judge down in the santa clara valley with the sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship but love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken john thornton to arouse 
 this man had saved his life which was something but further he was the ideal master other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it and he saw further he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with he called as much his delight as theirs he had a way of taking head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god you can all but speak 
 buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt he would often seize hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress 
 for the most part however love was expressed in adoration while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on knee buck was content to adore at a distance he would lie by the hour eager alert at feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of gaze would draw john head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as heart shone out 
 for a long time after his rescue buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again buck would follow at his heels his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and francois and the scotch had passed out even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his breathing 
 but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the northland had aroused in him remained alive and active faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness he was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by john fire rather than a dog of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection 
 his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly skeet and nig were too for they belonged to john thornton but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist and buck was merciless he had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death he had lessoned from spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course he must master or be mastered while to show mercy was a weakness mercy did not exist in the primordial life it was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law and this mandate down out of the depths of time he obeyed 
 he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn he linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed he sat by john fire a dog and but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams 
 so peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again 
 thornton alone held him the rest of mankind was as nothing chance travelers might praise or pet him but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away when partners hans and pete arrived on the raft buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting they were of the same large type as thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the at dawson they understood buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig 
 for thornton however his love seemed to grow and grow he alone among men could put a pack upon back in the summer traveling nothing was too great for buck to do when thornton commanded one day they had themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson for the head waters of the tanana the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away straight down to naked bedrock three hundred feet below john thornton was sitting near the edge buck at his shoulder a thoughtless whim seized thornton and he drew the attention of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind jump buck he commanded sweeping his arm out and over the chasm the next instant he was grappling with buck on the extreme edge while hans and pete were dragging them back into safety 
 uncanny pete said after it was over and they had caught their speech 
 thornton shook his head no it is splendid and it is terrible too do you know it sometimes makes me afraid 
 not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while around pete announced conclusively nodding his head toward buck 
 py jingo was contribution not mineself either 
 it was at circle city ere the year was out that apprehensions were realized black burton a man evil tempered and malicious had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar when thornton stepped good naturedly between buck as was his custom was lying in a corner head on paws watching his every action burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar 
 those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw body rise up in the air as he left the floor for throat the man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm but was hurled backward to the floor with buck on top of him buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat this time the man succeeded only in partly blocking and his throat was torn open then the crowd was upon buck and he was driven off but while a surgeon checked the bleeding he prowled up and down growling furiously attempting to rush in and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs a miners meeting called on the spot decided that the dog had sufficient provocation and buck was discharged but his reputation was made and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska 
 later on in the fall of the year he saved john life in quite another fashion the three partners were lining a long and narrow poling boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty mile creek hans and pete moved along the bank snubbing with a thin manila rope from tree to tree while thornton remained in the boat helping its descent by means of a pole and shouting directions to the shore buck on the bank worried and anxious kept abreast of the boat his eyes never off his master 
 at a particularly bad spot where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river hans cast off the rope and while thornton poled the boat out into the stream ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge this it did and was flying in a current as swift as a when hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly the boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up while thornton flung sheer out of it was carried toward the worst part of the rapids a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live 
 buck had sprung in on the instant and at the end of three hundred yards amid a mad swirl of water he thornton when he felt him grasp his tail buck headed for the bank swimming with all his splendid strength but the progress shoreward was slow the progress amazingly rapid from below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb the suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful and thornton knew that the shore was impossible he scraped furiously over a rock bruised across a second and struck a third with crushing force he clutched its slippery top with both hands releasing buck and above the roar of the churning water shouted go buck go 
 buck could not hold his own and swept on downstream struggling desperately but unable to win back when he heard command repeated he partly reared out of the water throwing his head high as though for a last look then turned obediently toward the bank he swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began 
 they knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging on they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to neck and shoulders being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming and launched him into the stream he struck out boldly but not straight enough into the stream he discovered the mistake too late when thornton was abreast of him and a bare strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past 
 hans promptly snubbed with the rope as though buck were a boat the rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current he was jerked under the surface and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out he was half drowned and hans and pete threw themselves upon him pounding the breath into him and the water out of him he staggered to his feet and fell down the faint sound of voice came to them and though they could not make out the words of it they knew that he was in his extremity his voice acted on buck like an electric shock he sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure 
 again the rope was attached and he was launched and again he struck out but this time straight into the stream he had miscalculated once but he would not be guilty of it a second time hans paid out the rope permitting no slack while pete kept it clear of coils buck held on till he was on a line straight above thornton then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him thornton saw him coming and as buck struck him like a battering ram with the whole force of the current behind him he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck hans snubbed the rope around the tree and buck and thornton were jerked under the water strangling suffocating sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other dragging over the jagged bottom smashing against rocks and snags they veered in to the bank 
 thornton came to belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by hans and pete his first glance was for buck over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a howl while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes thornton was himself bruised and battered and he went carefully over body when he had been brought around finding three broken ribs 
 that settles it he announced we camp right here and camp they did till ribs knitted and he was able to travel 
 that winter at dawson buck performed another exploit not so heroic perhaps but one that puts his name many notches higher on the totem pole of alaskan fame this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished and were enabled to make a trip into the virgin east where miners had not yet appeared it was brought about by a conversation in the eldorado saloon in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs buck because of his record was the target for these men and thornton was driven stoutly to defend him at the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it a second bragged six hundred for his dog and a third seven hundred 
 pooh pooh said john thornton buck can start a thousand pounds 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards demanded matthewson a bonanza king he of the seven hundred vaunt 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards john thornton said cooly 
 well matthewson said slowly and deliberately so that all could hear got a thousand dollars that says he and there it is so saying he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar 
 nobody spoke bluff if bluff it was had been called he could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face his tongue had tricked him he did not know whether buck could start a thousand pounds half a ton the enormousness of it appalled him he had great faith in strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load but never as now had he faced the possibility of it the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him silent and waiting further he had no thousand dollars nor had hans and pete 
 got a sled standing outside now with twenty sacks of flour on it matthewson went on with brutal directness so let that hinder you 
 thornton did not reply he did not know what to say he glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again the face of jim a mastodon king and comrade caught his eyes it was a cue to him seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing 
 can you lend me a thousand he asked almost in a whisper 
 sure answered thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of though little faith having john that the beast can do the trick 
 the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test the tables were deserted and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds several hundred men furred and mittened banked around the sled within easy distance sled loaded with a thousand pounds of flour had been standing for a couple of hours and in the intense cold it was sixty below runners had frozen fast to the snow men offered odds of two to one that buck could not budge the sled a quibble arose concerning the phrase break out contended it was privilege to knock the runners loose leaving buck to break it out from a dead standstill matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow a majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor whereat the odds went up to three to one against buck 
 there were no takers not a man believed him capable of the feat thornton had been hurried into the wager heavy with doubt and now that he looked at the sled itself the concrete fact with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it the more impossible the task appeared matthewson waxed jubilant 
 three to one he proclaimed lay you another thousand at that figure thornton what do you say 
 doubt was strong in his face but his fighting spirit was fighting spirit that soars above odds fails to recognize the impossible and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle he called hans and pete to him their sacks were slim and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars in the ebb of their fortunes this sum was their total capital yet they laid it unhesitatingly against six hundred 
 the team of ten dogs was unhitched and buck with his own harness was put into the sled he had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up he was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk down the neck and across the shoulders his mane in repose as it was half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active the great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of his body where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one 
 gad sir gad sir stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the skookum benches i offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test eight hundred just as he stands 
 thornton shook his head and stepped over to side 
 you must stand off from him matthewson protested free play and plenty of room 
 the crowd fell silent only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent animal but twenty sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch strings 
 thornton knelt down by side he took his head in his hands and rested cheek on cheek he did not playfully shake him as was his wont or murmur soft love curses but he whispered in his ear as you love me buck as you love me was what he whispered buck whined with suppressed eagerness 
 the crowd was watching curiously the affair was growing mysterious it seemed like a conjuration as thornton got to his feet buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly it was the answer in terms not of speech but of love thornton stepped well back 
 now buck he said 
 buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches it was the way he had learned 
 gee voice rang out sharp in the tense silence 
 buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds the load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling 
 haw thornton commanded 
 buck duplicated the maneuver this time to the left the crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side the sled was broken out men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact 
 now mush 
 command cracked out like a pistol shot buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge his whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur his great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the snow in parallel grooves the sled swayed and trembled forward one of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again half an inch an inch two inches the jerks perceptibly diminished as the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was moving steadily along 
 men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe thornton was running behind encouraging buck with short cheery words the distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command every man was tearing himself loose even matthewson hats and mittens were flying in the air men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel 
 but thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly 
 gad sir gad sir sputtered the skookum bench king give you a thousand for him sir a thousand hundred sir 
 thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir the best i can do for you sir 
 buck seized hand in his teeth thornton shook him back and forth as though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt

lionfish nov chapter six gilderoy lockhartcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next day however harry barely grinned once things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a and boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met 
 
 due any minute i think sending a few things i forgot 
 
 harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd a big lumpy package bounced off head and a second later something large and gray fell into jug spraying them all with milk and feathers 
 
 errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak 
 
 oh no ron gasped 
 
 all right still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger 
 
 not that that 
 
 ron was pointing at the red envelope it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 sent me a howler said ron faintly 
 
 better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper be worse if you my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible 
 
 harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope 
 
 a howler he said 
 
 but whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners 
 
 open it neville urged all be over in a few minutes 
 
 ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from beak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a split second later harry knew why he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling 
 
 stealing the car i have been surprised if expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone 
 
 mrs weasleys yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen 
 
 letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died 
 
 harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up he tried very hard to look as though he hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb 
 
 absolutely disgusted your facing an inquiry at work entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line bring you straight back home 
 
 a ringing silence fell the red envelope which had dropped from hand burst into flames and curled into ashes harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again 
 
 hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of head 
 
 well i know what you expected ron but you 
 
 tell me i deserved it snapped ron 
 
 harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer 
 
 but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first 
 
 harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again 
 
 as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings 
 
 professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming 
 
 oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow but i want you running away with the idea that better at herbology than she is i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels 
 
 greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self 
 
 there was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant flowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when hand shot out 
 
 harry been wanting a word you mind if a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout 
 
 judging by professor scowl she did mind but lockhart said the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face 
 
 harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head harry harry harry 
 
 completely nonplussed harry said nothing 
 
 when i heard well of course it was all my fault could have kicked myself 
 
 harry had no idea what he was talking about he was about to say so when lockhart went on know when been more shocked flying a car to hogwarts well of course i knew at once why done it stood out a mile harry harry harry 
 
 it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he talking 
 
 gave you a taste for publicity i said lockhart gave you the bug you got onto the front page of the paper with me and you wait to do it again 
 
 oh no professor see 
 
 harry harry harry said lockhart reaching out and grasping his shoulder i understand natural to want a bit more once had that first taste and i blame myself for giving you that because it was bound to go to your head but see here young man you start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed just calm down all right plenty of time for all that when older yes yes i know what thinking all right for him an internationally famous wizard when i was twelve i was just as much of a nobody as you are now in fact say i was even more of a nobody i mean a few people have heard of you they all that business with he glanced at the lightning scar on forehead i know i know not quite as good as winning witch most charming smile award five times in a row as i have but a start harry a start 
 
 he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off harry stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside 
 
 professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of ear muffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his place between ron and hermione she said be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandrake 
 
 to surprise hand was first into the air 
 
 mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermione sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state 
 
 excellent ten points to gryffindor said professor sprout the mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes it is also however dangerous who can tell me why 
 
 hand narrowly missed glasses as it shot up again 
 
 the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly 
 
 precisely take another ten points said professor sprout now the mandrakes we have here are still very young 
 
 she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyone shuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plants purplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quite unremarkable to harry who have the slightest idea what hermione meant by the cry of the mandrake 
 
 everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout 
 
 there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that pink and fluffy 
 
 when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them i will give you the right earmuffs on 
 
 harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out sound completely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her own ears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plants firmly and pulled hard 
 
 harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear 
 
 instead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he had pale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs 
 
 professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off her hands gave them all the and removed her own earmuffs 
 
 as our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries kill yet she said calmly as though just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia however they will knock you out for several hours and as sure none of you want to miss your first day back make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work i will attract your attention when it is time to pack up 
 
 four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula teething 
 
 she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder 
 
 harry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a hufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to 
 
 justin he said brightly shaking harry by the hand know who you are of course the famous harry potter and hermione granger always top in everything hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ron weasley that your flying car 
 
 ron smile the howler was obviously still on his mind 
 
 that something he said justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost awfully brave chap have you read his books have died of fear if id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf but he stayed cool and zap just fantastic 
 
 my name was down for eton you know i tell you how glad i am i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointed but since i made her read books i think begun to see how useful be to have a fully trained wizard in the family 
 
 after that they have much chance to talk their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professor sprout had made it look extremely easy but it the mandrakes like coming out of the earth but seem to want to go back into it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot 
 
 by the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweaty aching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration 
 
 professor classes were always hard work but today was especially difficult everything harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand 
 
 ron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wand with some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every time ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one professor mcgonagall pleased 
 
 harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrung sponge everyone filed out of the classroom except him and ron who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk 
 
 stupid useless thing 
 
 write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker 
 
 oh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag your own fault your wand got snapped 
 
 they went down to lunch where mood was not improved by showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in transfiguration 
 
 we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing the subject 
 
 defense against the dark arts said hermione at once 
 
 why demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined all lessons in little hearts 
 
 hermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiously 
 
 they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyages with vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw the very small boy seen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright red 
 
 all right harry colin creevey he said breathlessly taking a tentative step forward in gryffindor too think would it be all right if can i have a picture he said raising the camera hopefully 
 
 a picture harry repeated blankly 
 
 so i can prove met you said colin creevey eagerly edging further forward i know all about you told me about how you survived when tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked hairline and a boy in my dormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion the move colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said amazing here it i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts my a milkman he believe it either so taking loads of pictures to send home to him and be really good if i had one of you he looked imploringly at harry maybe your friend could take it and i could stand next to you and then could you sign it 
 
 signed photos giving out signed photos potter 
 
 loud and scathing draco voice echoed around the courtyard he had stopped right behind colin flanked as he always was at hogwarts by his large and thuggish cronies crabbe and goyle 
 
 everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd harry giving out signed photos 
 
 no not said harry angrily his fists clenching shut up malfoy 
 
 just jealous piped up colin whose entire body was about as thick as neck 
 
 jealous said malfoy who need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in of what i want a foul scar right across my head thanks i think getting your head cut open makes you that special myself 
 
 crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly 
 
 eat slugs malfoy said ron angrily crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way 
 
 be careful weasley sneered malfoy you want to start any trouble or your have to come and take you away from school he put on a shrill piercing voice if you put another toe out of line 
 
 
 
 a knot of slytherin nearby laughed loudly at this 
 
 weasley would like a signed photo potter smirked malfoy be worth more than his whole house 
 
 ron whipped out his spellotaped wand but hermione shut voyages with vampires with a snap and whispered look out 
 
 all this all this gilderoy lockhart was striding toward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him giving out signed photos 
 
 harry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially have asked we meet again harry 
 
 pinned to side and burning with humiliation harry saw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd 
 
 come on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colin a double portrait do better than that and both sign it for you 
 
 colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them signaling the start of afternoon classes 
 
 off you go move along there lockhart called to the crowd and he set off back to the castle with harry who was wishing he knew a good vanishing spell still clasped to his side 
 
 a word to the wise harry said lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door i covered up for you back there with young creevey if he was photographing me too your schoolmates think setting yourself up so much 
 
 deaf to stammers lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase 
 
 let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career sensible looks a tad bigheaded harry to be frank there may well come a time when like me need to keep a stack handy wherever you go but he gave a little chortle i think quite there yet 
 
 they had reached classroom and he let harry go at last harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven of books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at the real thing 
 
 the rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione sat down on either side of harry 
 
 you fried an egg on your face said ron better hope creevey meet ginny or be starting a harry potter fan club 
 
 shut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhart to hear the phrase harry potter fan club 
 
 when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell he reached forward picked up neville copy of travels with trolls and held it up to show his own winking portrait on the front 
 
 me he said pointing at it and winking as well gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award but i talk about that i get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her 
 
 he waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly 
 
 i see all bought a complete set of my books well done i thought start today with a little quiz nothing to worry about just to check how well read them how much taken in 
 
 when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said you have thirty minutes start now 
 
 harry looked down at his paper and read 
 
 
 what is gilderoy lockhart s favorite color 
 
 what is gilderoy secret ambition 
 
 what in your opinion is gilderoy greatest achievement to date 
 
 on and on it went over three sides of paper right down to 
 
 when is gilderoy birthday and what would his ideal gift be 
 
 half an hour later lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class 
 
 tut tut hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac i say so in year with the yeti and a few of you need to read wanderings with werewolves more carefully i clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and peoples though i say no to a large bottle of ogdeds old firewhisky 
 
 he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were sitting in front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening to lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name 
 
 but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of potions good girl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger 
 
 hermione raised a trembling hand 
 
 excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business 
 
 he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it 
 
 now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here all i ask is that you remain calm 
 
 in spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean and seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his front row seat 
 
 i must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it might provoke them 
 
 as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover 
 
 yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies 
 
 seamus finnigan control himself he let out a snort of laughter that even lockhart mistake for a scream of terror 
 
 yes he smiled at seamus 
 
 well not not very dangerous are they seamus choked 
 
 be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be 
 
 the pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing the moment the cover had been removed they had started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them 
 
 right then lockhart said loudly see what you make of them and he opened the cage 
 
 it was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rockets two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air several shot straight through the window showering the back row with broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling 
 
 come on now round them up round them up only pixies lockhart shouted 
 
 he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi 
 
 it had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way 
 
 the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harry ron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him 
 
 can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear 
 
 he just wants to give us some experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm and stuffing them back into their cage 
 
 hands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out hermione he have a clue what he was doing 
 
 rubbish said hermione read his books look at all those amazing things done 
 
 he says done ron muttered 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter six talons and tea leavescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter 
 
 ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him not worth it 
 
 hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooooo 
 
 harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley 
 
 new course schedules said george passing then over up with you harry 
 
 malfoy said ron sitting down on other side and glaring over at the slytherin table 
 
 george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again 
 
 that little git he said calmly he so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment he fred 
 
 nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy 
 
 i too happy myself said george horrible things those dementors 
 
 sort of freeze your insides they said fred 
 
 you pass out though did you said harry in a low voice 
 
 forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place ever been he came back all weak and shakingthey suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there 
 
 anyway see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember 
 
 the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes 
 
 hermione was examining her new schedule 
 
 ooh good starting some new subjects today she said happily 
 
 hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder messed up your timetable look got you down for about ten subjects a day there enough time 
 
 manage fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 but look said ron laughing see this morning nine divination and underneath nine muggle studies and ron leaned closer to the timetable disbelieving look underneath that arithmancy nine i mean i know good hermione but no that good you supposed to be in three classes at once 
 
 be silly said hermione shortly of course i be in three classes at once 
 
 well then 
 
 pass the marmalade said hermione 
 
 but 
 
 oh ron it to you if my a bit full hermione snapped i told you fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 just then hagrid entered the great hall he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand 
 
 all righ he said eagerly pausing on his way to the staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after lunch bin up since five getting everthin readyhope okme a 
 
 he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat 
 
 wonder what been getting ready said ron a note of anxiety in his voice 
 
 the hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson ron checked his schedule 
 
 better go look at the top of north tower take us ten minutes to get there 
 
 they finished breakfast hastily said goodbye to fred and george and walked back through the hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of laughter followed harry into the entrance hall 
 
 the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one two years at hogwarts taught them everything about the castle and they had never been inside north tower before 
 
 got to be a short cut ron panted as they climbed the seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall 
 
 i think this way said hermione peering down the empty passage to the right 
 
 be said ron south look you can see a bit of the lake outside the window 
 
 harry was watching the painting a fat pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other but he always enjoyed watching them a moment later a short squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees he had just fallen off 
 
 aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogs 
 
 they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass 
 
 are you all right said harry moving closer to the picture 
 
 get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue 
 
 the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face 
 
 listen said harry taking advantage of the exhaustion looking for the north tower you know the way do you 
 
 a quest the rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge 
 
 he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on 
 
 and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight 
 
 they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead 
 
 be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase 
 
 puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom 
 
 farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some monks farewell my if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan 
 
 yeah call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental 
 
 they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it 
 
 sibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read we supposed to get up there 
 
 as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at feet everyone got quiet 
 
 after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first 
 
 he emerged into the classroom he had ever seen in fact it look like a classroom at all more like a cross between attic and an tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups 
 
 ron appeared at shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers 
 
 where is she ron said 
 
 a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice 
 
 welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last 
 
 immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings 
 
 sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table 
 
 welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye 
 
 nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach youbooks can take you only so far in this field 
 
 at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books be much help in this subject 
 
 many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well 
 
 i think so said neville tremulously 
 
 i be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a man 
 
 parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him 
 
 in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us for ever 
 
 a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it 
 
 i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot 
 
 lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney 
 
 thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october 
 
 lavender trembled 
 
 now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones rather attached to the pink 
 
 sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you mindthank you 
 
 when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over 
 
 right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine 
 
 a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid 
 
 broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom 
 
 harry tried to pull himself together 
 
 right got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but a thing that could be the sun hang onthat means great going to suffer but be very happy 
 
 you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction 
 
 my turn ron peered into teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe going to work for the ministry of magic 
 
 he turned the teacup the other way up 
 
 but this way it looks more like an that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and a thing here he turned the cup again that looks like an animalyeah if that was its headit looks like a hippono a sheep 
 
 professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter 
 
 let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching cup from him everyone went quiet to watch 
 
 professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise 
 
 the falconmy dear you have a deadly enemy 
 
 but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her 
 
 well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and 
 
 harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to cup again and continued to turn it 
 
 the cluban attack dear dear this is not a happy cup 
 
 i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly 
 
 the skulldanger in your path my dear 
 
 everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed 
 
 there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed 
 
 my dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say no ask me 
 
 what is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and table pressing close to professor chair to get a good look at cup 
 
 my dear professor huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim 
 
 the what said harry 
 
 he could tell that he the only one who understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror 
 
 the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of death 
 
 stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor chair 
 
 i think it looks like a grim she said flatly 
 
 professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike 
 
 forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future 
 
 seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side 
 
 it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left 
 
 when all finished deciding whether going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him 
 
 i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yesplease pack away your things 
 
 silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding eyes 
 
 until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville be late next time so mind you work to catch up 
 
 harry ron and hermione descended professor ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time 
 
 harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes 
 
 really what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but the first time my not got applause from a class 
 
 heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand 
 
 please professor just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and 
 
 ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year 
 
 everyone stared at her 
 
 me said harry finally 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyes then you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney 
 
 she stopped again and then said in a very tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in 
 
 hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about cup 
 
 when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch 
 
 ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said 
 
 ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but start 
 
 harry he said in a low serious voice you seen a great black dog anywhere have you 
 
 yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys 
 
 ron let his fork fall with a clatter 
 
 probably a stray said hermione calmly 
 
 ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad 
 
 hermione if seen a grim bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died hours later 
 
 coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice 
 
 you know what talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards 
 
 there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the not an omen the cause of death and still with us because not stupid enough to see one and think right well better kick the bucket then 
 
 ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug 
 
 i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me 
 
 there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly 
 
 you seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly 
 
 professor trelawney said you have the right aura you just like being bad at something for a change 
 
 he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere 
 
 if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves not sure be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class 
 
 she snatched up her bag and stalked away 
 
 ron frowned after her 
 
 she talking about he said to harry she been to an arithmancy class yet 
 
 
 
 harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class 
 
 ron and hermione speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about 
 
 hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start 
 
 now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here right follow me 
 
 for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there 
 
 everyone gather round the fence here he called it make sure yeh can see now firs thing want ter do is open yer books 
 
 how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy 
 
 eh said hagrid 
 
 how do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips 
 
 hasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid looking crestfallen 
 
 the class all shook their heads 
 
 got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look 
 
 he took copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand 
 
 oh how silly all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why we guess 
 
 i i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione 
 
 oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off 
 
 shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted first lesson to be a success 
 
 righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so got yer books yeh need the magical creatures yeah so go an get em hang on 
 
 he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight 
 
 god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my have a fit when i tell him 
 
 shut up malfoy harry repeated 
 
 careful potter a dementor behind you 
 
 oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock 
 
 trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures 
 
 gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence 
 
 hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them aren they 
 
 harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black 
 
 so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer 
 
 no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously 
 
 now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are never insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson 
 
 yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt 
 
 right who wants ter go first 
 
 most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they seem to like being tethered like this 
 
 no one said hagrid with a pleading look 
 
 do it said harry 
 
 there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves 
 
 harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence 
 
 good man harry roared hagrid right then see how yeh get on with buckbeak 
 
 he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath eyes were narrowed maliciously 
 
 easy now harry said hagrid quietly got eye contact now try not ter blinkhippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much 
 
 eyes immediately began to water but he shut them buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye it said hagrid it harrynow bow 
 
 harry feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up 
 
 the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it move 
 
 ah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harry easy does it 
 
 but then to enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was 
 
 an unmistakable bow 
 
 well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch him pat his beak go on 
 
 feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it 
 
 the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed 
 
 righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he migh let yeh ride him 
 
 this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he sure a hippogriff would be quite the same 
 
 yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that 
 
 harry put his foot on the top of wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathers 
 
 go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters 
 
 without warning wings flapped open on either side of harry he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings 
 
 buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again 
 
 good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go 
 
 emboldened by success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful 
 
 this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do iti bet not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute 
 
 it happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a high pitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes 
 
 dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked dying look at me killed me 
 
 yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here 
 
 hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle 
 
 very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid 
 
 they should sack him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears 
 
 it was fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly 
 
 they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall 
 
 going to see if okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower 
 
 you think be all right said hermione nervously 
 
 course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse 
 
 that was a really bad thing to happen in first class though it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him 
 
 they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he there 
 
 they fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her pudding 
 
 better not said ron who eating either 
 
 harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured 
 
 well you say it an interesting first day back said ron gloomily 
 
 they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window 
 
 a light on in window harry said suddenly 
 
 ron looked at his watch 
 
 if we hurried we could go down and see him still quite early 
 
 i know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him 
 
 allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black got past the dementors yet has he 
 
 so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they entirely sure they were supposed to be out 
 
 the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hut they knocked and a voice growled 
 
 hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus 
 
 spect a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon ever had a teacher who lasted a day before

 not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard only a matter o time after malfoy

 tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a hug 
 
 i think had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it 
 
 ah maybe right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash 
 
 he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard 
 
 stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away 
 
 hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes

 hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though only just realized he was there

 harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in room when he was being shaken awake by mrs weasley 
 
 time to go harry dear she whispered moving away to wake ron 
 
 harry felt around for his glasses put them on and sat up it was still dark outside ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him at the foot of mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets 
 
 s time already said fred groggily 
 
 they dressed in silence too sleepy to talk then yawning and stretching the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove while mr weasley was sitting at the table checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt 
 
 what think he asked anxiously supposed to go incognito do i look like a muggle harry 
 
 yeah said harry smiling very good 
 
 bill and charlie and said george failing to stifle a huge yawn 
 
 well apparating they said mrs weasley heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls so they can have a bit of a 
 
 harry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficult 
 
 so still in bed said fred grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him why we apparate too 
 
 because not of age and you passed your test snapped mrs weasley and where have those girls got to 
 
 she bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs 
 
 you have to pass a test to apparate harry asked 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license not easy apparition and when not done property it can lead to nasty complications this pair talking about went and splinched themselves 
 
 everyone around the table except harry winced 
 
 er splinched said harry 
 
 they left half of themselves behind said mr weasley now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge so of course they were stuck move either way had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out meant a fair old bit of paperwork i can tell you what with the muggles who spotted the body parts left behind 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drive 
 
 were they okay he asked startled 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley but they got a heavy fine and i think be trying it again in a hurry you mess around with apparition there are plenty of adult wizards who bother with it prefer brooms slower but safer 
 
 but bill and charlie and percy can all do it 
 
 charlie had to take the test twice said fred grinning he failed the first time apparated five miles south of where he meant to right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping remember 
 
 yes well he passed the second time said mrs weasley marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers 
 
 percy only passed two weeks ago said george been apparating downstairs every morning since just to prove he can 
 
 there were footsteps down the passageway and hermione and ginny came into the kitchen both looking pale and drowsy 
 
 why do we have to be up so early ginny said rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table 
 
 got a bit of a walk said mr weasley 
 
 walk said harry what are we walking to the world cup 
 
 no no miles away said mr weasley smiling we only need to walk a short way just that very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cup 
 
 george said mrs weasley sharply and they all jumped 
 
 what said george in an innocent tone that deceived nobody 
 
 what is that in your pocket 
 
 nothing 
 
 you lie to me 
 
 mrs weasley pointed her wand at pocket and said accio 
 
 several small brightly colored objects zoomed out of pocket he made a grab for them but missed and they sped right into mrs outstretched hand 
 
 we told you to destroy them said mrs weasley furiously holding up what were unmistakably more toffees we told you to get rid of the lot empty your pockets go on both of you 
 
 it was an unpleasant scene the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible and it was only by using her summoning charm that mrs weasley managed to find them all 
 
 accio accio accio she shouted and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places including the lining of jacket and the of jeans 
 
 we spent six months developing those fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away 
 
 oh a fine way to spend six months she shrieked no wonder you get more 
 
 all in all the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure mrs weasley was still glowering as she kissed mr weasley on the cheek though not nearly as much as the twins who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her 
 
 well have a lovely time said mrs weasley and behave yourselves she called after the twins retreating backs but they did not look back or answer send bill charlie and percy along around midday mrs weasley said to mr weasley as he harry ron hermione and ginny set off across the dark yard after fred and george 
 
 it was chilly and the moon was still out only a dull greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer harry having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the quidditch world cup sped up to walk with mr weasley 
 
 so how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing he asked 
 
 been a massive organizational problem sighed mr weasley the trouble is about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup and of course we just got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all there are places muggles penetrate but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and so we had to find a nice deserted moor and set up as many precautions as possible the whole been working on it for months first of course we have to stagger the arrivals people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand a limited number use muggle transport but we have too many clogging up their buses and trains remember wizards are coming from all over the world some apparate of course but we have to set up safe points for them to appear well away from muggles i believe a handy wood using as the apparition point for those who want to apparate or we use portkeys objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time you can do large groups at a time if you need to there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill so where headed 
 
 mr weasley pointed ahead of them where a large black mass rose beyond the village of ottery st catchpole 
 
 what sort of objects are portkeys said harry curiously 
 
 well they can be anything said mr weasley unobtrusive things obviously so muggles go picking them up and playing with themstuff just think is litter 
 
 they trudged down the dark dank lane toward the village the silence broken only by their footsteps the sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue hands and feet were freezing mr weasley kept checking his watch 
 
 they have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes slipping on thick black tuffets of grass each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when at last his feet found level ground 
 
 whew panted mr weasley taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater well made good time got ten minutes 
 
 hermione came over the crest of the hill last clutching a stitch in her side 
 
 now we just need the portkey said mr weasley replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground it be on 
 
 they spread out searching they had only been at it for a couple of minutes however when a shout rent the still air 
 
 over here arthur over here son got it 
 
 two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop 
 
 amos said mr weasley smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted the rest of them followed 
 
 mr weasley was shaking hands with a wizard with a scrubby brown beard who was holding a old boot in his other hand 
 
 this is amos diggory everyone said mr weasley he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures and i think you know his son cedric 
 
 cedric diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen he was captain and seeker of the hufflepuff house quidditch team at hogwarts 
 
 hi said cedric looking around at them all 
 
 everybody said hi back except fred and george who merely nodded they had never quite forgiven cedric for beating their team gryffindor in the first quidditch match of the previous year 
 
 long walk arthur father asked not too bad said mr weasley we live just on the other side of the village there you 
 
 had to get up at two we ced i tell you be glad when got his apparition test stillnot complainingquidditch world cup miss it for a sackful of galleons and the tickets cost about that mind you looks like i got off easy amos diggory peered around at the three weasley boys harry hermione and ginny all these yours arthur 
 
 oh no only the redheads said mr weasley pointing out his children this is hermione friend of and harry another friend 
 
 beard said amos diggory his eyes widening harry harry potter 
 
 er yeah said harry 
 
 harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead but it always made him feel uncomfortable 
 
 talked about you of course said amos diggory told us all about playing against you last yeari said to him i said ced be something to tell your grandchildren that beat harry potter 
 
 harry think of any reply to this so he remained silent fred and george were both scowling again cedric looked slightly embarrassed 
 
 harry fell off his broom dad he muttered i told youit was an accident 
 
 yes but you fall off did you roared amos genially slapping his son on his back always modest our ced always the gentlemanbut the best man won sure say the same you eh one falls off his broom one stays on you need to be a genius to tell which the better flier 
 
 must be nearly time said mr weasley quickly pulling out his watch again do you know whether waiting for any more amos 
 
 no the lovegoods have been there for a week already and the fawcetts get tickets said mr diggory there any more of us in this area are there 
 
 not that i know of said mr weasley yes a minute better get ready 
 
 he looked around at harry and hermione 
 
 you just need to touch the portkey all a finger will do 
 
 with difficulty owing to their bulky backpacks the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by amos diggory 
 
 they all stood there in a tight circle as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop nobody spoke it suddenly occurred to harry how odd this would look if a muggle were to walk up here nownine people two of them grown men clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness waiting 
 
 three muttered mr weasley one eye still on his watch twoone 
 
 it happened immediately harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward his feet left the ground he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then 
 
 his feet slammed into the ground ron staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud 
 
 harry looked up mr weasley mr diggory and cedric were still standing though looking very windswept everybody else was on the ground 
 
 seven past five from stoatshead hill said a voice 
 
 rowling

 mrs weasley followed them upstairs looking grim 
 
 i want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said as they reached the first landing got a busy day tomorrow i expect asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her up 
 
 asleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor if not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then a flobberworm 
 
 all right ron harry said mrs weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with you 
 
 night harry and ron said to the twins 
 
 sleep tight said fred winking 
 
 mrs weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply as though its invisible occupant was asleep harry put on his pyjamas took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly 
 
 we let them out to hunt every night ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas dumbledore want too many owls swooping around the square thinks look suspicious oh yeah i forgot 
 
 he crossed to the door and bolted it 
 
 you doing that for 
 
 kreacher said ron as he turned off the light first night i was here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the covers then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what reckon 
 
 harry need to ask what ron meant 
 
 well they tell us much we have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all really said is that the trying to stop people joining vol 
 
 there was a sharp intake of breath from ron 
 
 demort said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin do 
 
 ron ignored this last comment 
 
 yeah right he said we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears the only new bit was 
 
 crack 
 
 ouch 
 
 keep your voice down ron or be back up here 
 
 you two just apparated on my knees 
 
 yeah well harder in the dark 
 
 harry saw the blurred outlines of fred and george leaping down from bed there was a groan of bedsprings and mattress descended a few inches as george sat down near his feet 
 
 so got there yet said george eagerly 
 
 the weapon sirius mentioned said harry 
 
 let slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we hear about that on the old extendables did we 
 
 what reckon it is said harry 
 
 could be anything said fred 
 
 but there be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron worse than death 
 
 maybe something that can kill loads of people at once suggested george 
 
 maybe some particularly painful way of killing people said ron learfully 
 
 got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he need anything more efficient than that 
 
 there was a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate 
 
 so who got it now asked george 
 
 i hope our side said ron sounding slightly nervous 
 
 if it is probably keeping it said fred 
 
 where said ron quickly hogwarts 
 
 bet it is said george where he hid the stone 
 
 a going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ron 
 
 not necessarily said fred 
 
 yeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginny 
 
 what mean said harry 
 
 never been on the receiving end of one of her hexes have you 
 
 shhh said fred from the bed listen 
 
 they fell silent footsteps were coming up the stairs 
 
 mum said george and without further ado there was a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few seconds later they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mrs weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking 
 
 hedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and george 
 
 she trust us at all you know said ron regretfully 
 
 harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mrs weasley was now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creatures teacher was saying beauties they eh harry be studyin weapons this term and harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him he ducked 
 
 the next thing he knew he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and loud voice was filling the room 
 
 mum says get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room there are loads more doxys than she thought and found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa 
 
 half an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long room on the first floor with walls covered in dirty tapestries the carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees it was around these that mrs weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end 
 
 cover your faces and take a spray mrs weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a table doxycide never seen an infestation this badwhat that been doing for the last ten years 
 
 face was half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mrs weasley 
 
 really old he probably manage 
 
 be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wants to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to enquiring look i keep him upstairs in my bedroom anyway this writing desk 
 
 he dropped the bag of rats into an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time was shaking slightly 
 
 well molly pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let have a shifty at it before we let it outknowing my mother it could be something much worse 
 
 right you are sirius said mrs weasley 
 
 they were both speaking in carefully light polite voices that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before 
 
 a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella stand 
 
 i keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying out of the room they heard him thundering clown the stairs as mrs screeches echoed up through the house once more stains of dishonour filthy blood traitors children of flith 
 
 close the door please harry said mrs weasley 
 
 harry took as much time as he dared to close the door he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the front door and then a deep voice he recognised as kingsley saying just relieved me so got cloak now thought leave a report for dumbledore 
 
 feeling mrs eyes on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the door and rejoined the doxy party 
 
 mrs weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in gilderoy guide to household pests which was lying open on the sofa 
 
 right you lot you need to be careful because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous got a bottle of antidote here but rather nobody needed it 
 
 she straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward 
 
 when i say the word start spraying immediately she said come flying out at us i expect but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them when immobilized just throw them in this bucket 
 
 she stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray 
 
 all rightsquirt 
 
 harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny wings whirring tiny teeth bared its body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk on to the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket 
 
 fred what are you doing said mrs weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it away 
 
 harry looked round fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb 
 
 fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mrs back was turned he pocketed it with a wink 
 
 we want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breath 
 
 deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxes 
 
 range of sweets to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mrs back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer chews if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up moment been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half 
 
 which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom what putting in the adverts anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mrs line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end 
 
 testers 
 
 us said fred we take it in turns george did the fainting fancieswe both tried the nosebleed nougat 
 
 mum thought been duelling said george 
 
 joke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray 
 
 well we had a chance to get premises yet said fred dropping his voice even lower as mrs weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so running it as a service at the moment we put advertisements in the daily prophet last week 
 
 all thanks to you mate said george but worry mum got a clue she read the daily prophet any more cause of it telling lies about you and dumbledore 
 
 harry grinned he had forced the weasley twins to take the prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs weasley she did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons 
 
 the of the curtains took most of the morning it was past midday when mrs weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust having sat on the bag of dead rats the curtains were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs at which crookshanks was now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous looks 
 
 i think tackle those after lunch 
 
 mrs weasley pointed at the dusty cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of objects a selection of rusty daggers claws a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages harry could not understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry was quite sure was blood 
 
 the clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mrs weasley 
 
 stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs blacks screeches started up again from down below bring up some sandwiches 
 
 she left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons 
 
 mundungus said hermione he brought all those cauldrons for 
 
 probably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldrons 
 
 yeah right said fred as the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view blimey mum like that 
 
 he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening closely mrs screaming had stopped 
 
 mundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration hear properly reckon we can risk the extendable ears 
 
 might be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair 
 
 but at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ears quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mrs weasley was shouting at the top of her voice 
 
 we are not running a hideout for stolen goods 
 
 i love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow mrs voice to permeate the room better it makes such a nice change 
 
 completely irresponsible as if we got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldrons into the house 
 
 the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours and been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you harryand there goes mum again 
 
 mrs voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall 
 
 george made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a edged into the room 
 
 except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle it was completely naked it looked very old its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large batlike ears its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike 
 
 the elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting as though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly towards the far end of the room all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse deep voice like a smells like a drain and a criminal to boot but no better nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum let into her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves poor old kreacher what can he do 
 
 hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snap 
 
 the froze in his tracks stopped muttering and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise 
 
 kreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still lacing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is 
 
 sorry said george catch that last bit 
 
 kreacher said nothing said the elf with a second bow to george adding in a clear undertone and its twin unnataral little beasts they are 
 
 harry know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter 
 
 and the mudblood standing there bold as brass oh if my mistress knew oh how cry and a new boy kreacher know his name what is he doing here kreacher know 
 
 this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potter 
 
 pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever 
 
 the mudblood is talking to kreacher as though she is my friend if mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say 
 
 call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrily 
 
 it matter hermione whispered not in his right mind he know what 
 
 kid yourself hermione he knows exactly what saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislike 
 
 kreacher was still muttering his eyes on harry 
 
 is it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true the boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonders how he did it 
 
 we all kreacher said fred 
 
 what do you want anyway george asked 
 
 huge eyes darted towards george 
 
 kreacher is cleaning he said evasively 
 
 a likely story said a voice behind harry 
 
 sirius had come back he was glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mrs weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen 
 
 at the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor 
 
 stand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up to 
 
 kreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher lives to serve the noble house of black 
 
 and getting blacker every day filthy said sirius 
 
 master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his heart 
 
 my mother have a heart kreacher snapped sirius she kept herself alive out of pure spite 
 
 kreacher bowed again as he spoke 
 
 whatever master says he muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his boots oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he was 
 
 i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we throw it out 
 
 kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out seven centuries been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it 
 
 i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacher 
 
 it seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room 
 
 comes back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasures thrown out she swore he was no son of hers and back they say a murderer too 
 
 keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf 
 
 sirius not right in the head hermione pleaded i think he realises we can hear him 
 
 been alone too long said sirius taking mad orders from my portrait and talking to himself but he was always a foul little 
 
 if you could just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe 
 
 we set him free he knows too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaves this house see how he takes it 
 
 sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followed 
 
 the tapestry looked immensely old it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back as far as harry could tell to the middle ages large words at the very top of the tapestry read 
 
 the noble and most ancient house of pur 
 
 not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree closely 
 
 i used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home quite fond of muttering the story under his breath 
 
 you ran away from home 
 
 when i was about sixteen said sirius had enough 
 
 where did you go asked harry staring at him 
 
 your place said sirius your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son yeah i camped out at your in the school holidays and then when i was seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of been wiped off here too probably whyanyway after that i looked after myself i was always welcome at mr and mrs potters for sunday lunch though 
 
 but why did you 
 
 leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them him 
 
 sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen years previously followed the date of birth 
 
 he was younger than me said sirius and a much better son as i was constantly reminded 
 
 but he died said harry 
 
 yeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eaters 
 
 kidding 
 
 come on harry you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were said sirius testily 
 
 werewere your parents death eaters as well 
 
 no no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of and having in charge they alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true colours who thought he had the right idea about things they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parents thought regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first 
 
 was he killed by an auror harry asked tentatively 
 
 oh no said sirius no he was murdered by voldemort or on orders more likely i doubt regulus was ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out well you just hand in your resignation to voldemort a lifetime of service or death 
 
 lunch said mrs voice 
 
 she was holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip she was very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestry 
 
 i looked at this for years phineas nigellus my see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my tried to force through a ministry bill to make legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading when they got too old to carry tea trays of course any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks on here maybe why kreacher take orders from supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him 
 
 you and tonks are related harry asked surprised 
 
 oh yeah her mother andromeda was my favourite cousin said sirius examining the tapestry closely no not on here either look 
 
 he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names bellatrix and narcissa 
 
 sisters are still here because they made lovely respectable marriages but andromeda married a ted tonks so 
 
 sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he was too busy staring at the names to the right of burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name draco 
 
 related to the malfoys 
 
 the families are all interrelated said sirius if only going to let your sons and daughters marry our choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left molly and i are cousins by marriage and something like my second cousin once removed but no point looking for them on hereif ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors the weasleys 
 
 but harry was now looking at the name to the left of burn bellatrix black which was connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrange 
 
 lestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach 
 
 in azkaban said sirius shortly 
 
 harry looked at him curiously 
 
 bellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice brother rabastan was with them too 
 
 then harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty 
 
 you never said she was your 
 
 does it matter if my cousin snapped sirius as far as concerned not my family certainly not my family i seen her since i was your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming into azkaban think proud of having a relative like her 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i meani was just surprised all 
 
 it matter apologise sirius mumbled he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets i like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought be stuck in this house again 
 
 harry understood completely he knew how he would feel when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever to return and live at number four privet drive 
 
 ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here unplottable so muggles could never come and callas if ever have wanted toand now added his protection be hard put to find a safer house anywhere for the order you knownobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it isthat note moody showed you last night that was from dumbledore sirius gave a short laugh if my parents could see the use their house was being put to now well my mothers portrait should give you some idea 
 
 he scowled for a moment then sighed 
 
 i mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearingas snuffles obviouslyso i can give you a bit of moral support what think 
 
 harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best and hearing everything that was going on it had completely flown his mind at words however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwiches and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without him 
 
 worry sirius said harry looked up and realised that sirius had been watching him sure clear you definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life 
 
 but if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with you 
 
 sirius smiled sadly 
 
 see 
 
 feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed him 
 
 they must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomily 
 
 hurry up you two or there be any food left mrs weasley called 
 
 sirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry then he and harry went to join the others 
 
 harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the cabinets that afternoon fortunately for him it was a job that required a lot of concentration as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove 
 
 ok he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal must be wartcap powder in there 
 
 he threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already pocket 
 
 they found an silver instrument something like a pair of tweezers which scuttled up arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled nobility a wizarding genealogy there was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seals and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to grandfather for services to the ministry 
 
 it means he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack 
 
 several times kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius names harry had never heard before 
 
 it was my said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher quite as devoted to him as to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my old trousers last week 
 
 mrs weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days the drawing room took three days to decontaminate finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what was inside it 
 
 they moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed 
 
 snape might refer to their work as cleaning but in opinion they were really waging war on the house which was putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudblood and traitors and scum 
 
 at which sirius ignoring protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room 
 
 the doorbell rang several times a day which was the cue for mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before mrs weasley recalled them to their tasks snape flitted in and out of the house several times more though to relief they never came face to face harry also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat and she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitors stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who was staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mrs eyes by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe 
 
 despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled the idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he was determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with sirius 
 
 he felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mrs weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wonders 
 
 ron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew 
 
 how am i getting there he asked mrs weasley trying to sound unconcerned 
 
 taking you to work with him said mrs weasley gently 
 
 mr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the table 
 
 you can wait in my office until time for the hearing he said 
 
 harry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mrs weasley had answered it 
 
 professor dumbledore think a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i 
 
 think quite right said sirius through clenched teeth 
 
 mrs weasley pursed her lips 
 
 when did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at sirius 
 
 he came last night when you were in bed said mr weasley 
 
 sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry lowered his own eyes to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if it were possible even worse 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter six detourcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry remained within the confines of the garden over the next few weeks he spent most of his days playing quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs weasley put in front of him 
 
 it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mrs displeasure sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever 
 
 there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and found igor body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it well frankly surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember 
 
 yes well said mrs weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff 
 
 did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran 
 
 the place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice creams happened to him 
 
 dragged off by the look of his place 
 
 why asked ron while mrs weasley pointedly glared at bill 
 
 who knows he upset them somehow he was a good man florean 
 
 talking of diagon alley said mr weasley looks like gone too 
 
 the said ginny looking startled 
 
 the one empty no sign of a struggle no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped 
 
 but people do for wands 
 
 make do with other makers said lupin but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him not so good for us 
 
 the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain 
 
 that gives you equal status with prefects cried hermione happily you can use our special bathroom now and everything 
 
 wow i remember when charlie wore one of these said ron examining the badge with glee harry this is so cool my captain if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha 
 
 well i suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now got these sighed mrs weasley looking down booklist go on saturday as long as your father have to go into work again not going there without him 
 
 mum honestly think going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts sniggered ron 
 
 fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they said mrs weasley firing up at once if you think a laughing matter you can stay behind and get your things myself 
 
 no i wanna come i want to see fred and shop said ron hastily 
 
 then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide too immature to come with us said mrs weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of towels and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well 
 
 ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room 
 
 blimey you even make a joke round here anymore 
 
 but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry 
 
 mine demanded ron at once his eyes wide 
 
 already idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his well trust me this easier 
 
 thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold 
 
 e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back 
 
 it was an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks 
 
 good dad can get us these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat 
 
 get used to it only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mrs weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a sofa been given security status and be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too 
 
 harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak 
 
 here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron to wait for you any idea how long be 
 
 a couple of hours i expect said mr weasley ah good here 
 
 harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles 
 
 harry he boomed sweeping harry into a hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeakwitherwings i meanyeh should see him harry so happy ter be back in the open air 
 
 glad pleased said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs we know security meant you 
 
 i know jus like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets lets get goin thenafter yeh molly arthur 
 
 the leaky cauldron was for the first time in memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know 
 
 tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around 
 
 diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple posters carried versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few windows were boarded up including those of florean ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of stalls had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front 
 
 amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi 
 a little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby 
 
 one for your little girl madam he called at mrs weasley as they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck 
 
 if i were on duty said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller 
 
 yes but go arresting anyone now dear in a hurry said mrs weasley nervously consulting a list i think better do madam first hermione wants new dress robes and showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry grown so much come on everyone 
 
 molly it make sense for all of us to go to madam said mr weasley why those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get school books 
 
 i know said mrs weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think 
 
 don fret be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mrs weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam 
 
 harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone 
 
 migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all o us said hagrid stopping outside madam and bending down to peer through the window stand guard outside all righ 
 
 so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue 
 
 not a child in case you noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone 
 
 there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore nothing to do with being a child 
 
 watch where sticking that pin will you 
 
 a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eyes narrowed 
 
 if wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy 
 
 i think any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy 
 
 hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered no honestly not worth it 
 
 yeah like dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers 
 
 quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madamplease 
 
 narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack 
 
 put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do 
 
 really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her he was as tall as she was now going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you 
 
 madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart 
 
 really you accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please 
 
 but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly 
 
 i see that being favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore always be there to protect you 
 
 harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow look at that not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband 
 
 malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly 
 
 you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled 
 
 all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius 
 
 harry raised his wand higher 
 
 harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think you be in such trouble 
 
 madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry 
 
 i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just 
 
 ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where putting your pins woman mother i think i want these anymore 
 
 he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam feet 
 
 right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shops here do better at twilfitt and 
 
 and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out 
 
 well really said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust 
 
 she was distracted all through the fitting of and new robes tried to sell hermione dress robes instead of and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them 
 
 got asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side 
 
 just about said harry did you see the malfoys 
 
 yeah said hagrid unconcerned but they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry about them 
 
 harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mrs weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books 
 
 everyone all right said mrs weasley got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and stick close now 
 
 neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mrs weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george 
 
 we really got too long mrs weasley said so just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close number 
 
 ron stopping in his tracks 
 
 set against the dull shop fronts around them fred and georges windows hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather people had actually come to a halt transfixed the window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked eyes began to water just looking at it the window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters 
 
 why are you worrying about 
 you should be worrying about 
 
 the constipation sensation gripping the nation 
 harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lips moved silently mouthing the name 
 
 be murdered in their beds she whispered 
 
 no they said ron who like harry was laughing this is brilliant 
 
 and he and harry led the way into the shop it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in and varieties a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangmanspell it or swing 
 
 patented daydream charms 
 
 hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship 
 
 one simple incantation and you will enter a highly realistic daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic 
 
 for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free 
 
 a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair 
 
 how are you harry they shook hands and happened to your eye hermione 
 
 your punching telescope she said ruefully 
 
 oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here 
 
 he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste 
 
 just dab it on that be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent testing most of our products on ourselves 
 
 hermione looked nervous it is safe it she asked 
 
 course it is said fred bracingly come on harry give you a tour 
 
 harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks 
 
 muggle magic tricks said fred happily pointing them out for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff not a big earner but we do fairly steady business great novelties oh george 
 
 twin shook hand energetically 
 
 giving him the tour come through the back harry where making the real money pocket anything you and pay in more than galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark make anyone sick 
 
 george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued 
 
 just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened 
 
 you believe how many people even people who work at the ministry do a decent shield charm said george course they have you teaching them harry 
 
 right well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff and still getting massive orders 
 
 so expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves 
 
 i mean they help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes 
 
 and then we thought get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder importing it from peru handy if you want to make a quick escape 
 
 and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look said fred pointing at a number of black objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one 
 
 handy said harry impressed 
 
 here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry 
 
 a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes 
 
 a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said 
 
 harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride 
 
 right you are verity coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge 
 
 i do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators 
 
 you pay here said fred firmly waving away gold 
 
 but 
 
 you gave us our loan we forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask 
 
 george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms 
 
 you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet asked fred follow me ladies 
 
 near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary 
 
 there you go said fred proudly best range of love potions find anywhere 
 
 ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked 
 
 certainly they work for up to hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question 
 
 and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when already got about five boys on the go from what 
 
 whatever heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf this 
 
 guaranteed pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas 
 
 yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five what are those 
 
 she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting squeaks 
 
 pygmy puffs said george miniature puffskeins we breed them fast enough so what about michael corner 
 
 i dumped him he was a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it really cute 
 
 fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but moving through boyfriends a bit fast you 
 
 ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips there was such a mrs glare on her face that harry was surprised fred recoil 
 
 none of your business and thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two 
 
 three galleons nine sickles and a knut said fred examining the many boxes in arms cough up 
 
 your brother 
 
 and our stuff nicking three galleons nine sickles knock off the knut 
 
 but i got three galleons nine sickles 
 
 better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves 
 
 ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs weasley who had chosen that moment to appear 
 
 if i see you do that again jinx your fingers together she said sharply 
 
 mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once 
 
 a what said mrs weasley warily 
 
 look so sweet 
 
 mrs weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone as he passed weasleys wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him 
 
 wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning 
 
 given her the slip by the looks of it said ron 
 
 why though said hermione 
 
 harry said nothing he was thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches 
 
 harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent 
 
 he glanced around mrs weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs mr weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards fred and george were both helping customers on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street 
 
 get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag 
 
 ohi know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs weasley 
 
 come on said ron 
 
 she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and products harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had 
 
 he was going in that direction murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them 
 
 they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead 
 
 him it she whispered turning left 
 
 big surprise whispered ron 
 
 for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight 
 
 quick or lose him said harry speeding up 
 
 our be seen said hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays 
 
 it matter said harry impatiently just hurry 
 
 but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts or at least to be seen buying them 
 
 hermione gave his arm a hard pinch 
 
 ouch 
 
 shh look in there she breathed in ear 
 
 they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movements of hands he was talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an stooping man stood facing malfoy he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear 
 
 if only we could hear what saying said hermione 
 
 we can said ron excitedly hang ondamn 
 
 he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest 
 
 extendable ears look 
 
 fantastic said hermione as ron unraveled the long strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door imperturbable 
 
 no said ron gleefully listen 
 
 they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on 
 
 you know how to fix it 
 
 possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself need to see it though why you bring it into the shop 
 
 i said malfoy got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it 
 
 harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously 
 
 well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i guarantee anything 
 
 no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering perhaps this will make you more confident 
 
 he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened 
 
 tell anyone said maifoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback a family friend be dropping in from time to time to make sure giving the problem your full attention 
 
 there will be no need for 
 
 decide that said malfoy well better be off and forget to keep that one safe need it 
 
 perhaps like to take it now 
 
 no of course i you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just sell it 
 
 of course not sir 
 
 borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy 
 
 not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand 
 
 naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again 
 
 next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried 
 
 what was that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears 
 
 dunno said harry thinking hard he wants something mended and he wants to reserve something in there could you see what he pointed at when he said that one 
 
 no he was behind that cabinet 
 
 you two stay here whispered hermione 
 
 what are you 
 
 but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry 
 
 hello horrible morning it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display 
 
 is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a case 
 
 if got one and a half thousand galleons said mr borgin coldly 
 
 oherno i got quite that much said hermione walking on and what about this lovelyumskull 
 
 sixteen galleons 
 
 so for sale then it being kept for anyone 
 
 mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds 
 
 the thing is thaterboy who was in here just now draco malfoy well a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if already reserved anything i obviously want to get him the same thing so um 
 
 it was a pretty lame story in opinion and apparently borgin thought so too 
 
 out he said sharply get out 
 
 hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign 
 
 ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious 
 
 well next time you can show me how done master of mystery she snapped 
 
 ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very mrs weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly

 the shock of losing hung over the house in the days that followed harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other order members who passed in and out to relay news harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy horcruxes as soon as possible 
 
 well you cant do anything about the c ron mouthed the word horcruxes c till youre seventeen youve still got the trace on you and we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we or he dropped his voice to a whisper dyou reckon you already know where the are 
 
 no harry admitted 
 
 i think hermiones been doing a bit of research said ron she said she was saving it for when you got here 
 
 they were sitting at the breakfast table mr weasley and bill had just left for work mrs weasley had gone upstairs to wake hermione and ginny while fleur had drifted off to take a bath 
 
 the tracell break on the said harry that means i only need to stay here four days then i can c 
 
 five days ron corrected him firmly weve got to stay for the wedding theyll kill us if we miss it 
 
 harry understood they to mean fleur and mrs weasley 
 
 its one extra day said ron when harry looked mutinous 
 
 dont they realize how important c 
 
 course they dont said ron they havent got a clue and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that 
 
 ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that mrs weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to harry 
 
 mums been trying to get it out of hermione and me what were off to do shell try you next so brace yourself dad and lupinve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it not mum though shes determined 
 
 rons prediction came true within hours shortly before lunch mrs weasley detached harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started 
 
 ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts she began in a light casual tone 
 
 oh said harry well yeah we are 
 
 the mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of mr weasleys vests 
 
 may i ask why you are abandoning your education said mrs weasley 
 
 well dumbledore left me stuff to do mumbled harry ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too 
 
 what sort of stuff 
 
 im sorry i cant c 
 
 well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and im sure mr and mrs granger would agree said mrs weasley harry had been afraid of the concerned parent attack he forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as ginnys this did not help 
 
 dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know mrs weasley im sorry ron and hermione dont have to come its their choice c 
 
 i dont see that you have to go either she snapped dropping all pretense now youre barely of age any of you its utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command harry you must have misunderstood him probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted youc 
 
 i didnt misunderstand said harry flatly its got to be me 
 
 he handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes 
 
 and thats not mine i dont support puddlemere united 
 
 oh of course not said mrs weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone i should have realized well harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleurs wedding will you theres still so much to do 
 
 no c i c of course not said harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject 
 
 sweet of you she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery 
 
 from that moment on mrs weasley kept harry ron and hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think the kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that mrs weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of and the terrors of their recent journey after two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of favors ribbons and flowers of the garden and helping mrs weasley cook vast batches of canaps however harry started to suspect her of a different motive all the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him ron and hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about voldemort torturing ollivander 
 
 i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving ginny told harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay 
 
 and then what does she thinks going to happen harry muttered someone else might kill off voldemort while shes holding us here making 
 
 he had spoken without thinking and saw ginnys face whiten 
 
 so its true she said thats what youre trying to do 
 
 i c not c i was joking said harry evasively 
 
 they stared at each other and there was something more than shock in ginnys expression suddenly harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the hogwarts grounds he was sure she was remembering them too both of them jumped as the door opened and mr weasley kingsley and bill walked in 
 
 they were often joined by other order members for dinner now because the burrow had replaced number twelve grimmauld place as the headquarters mr weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore their each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld places location had become a in turn 
 
 and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody we cant expect it to hold much longer 
 
 but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now asked harry 
 
 well set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky 
 
 the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks harry found himself crammed beside ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken 
 
 no news about harry asked bill 
 
 nothing replied bill 
 
 they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle 
 
 the daily prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the body bill went on but that doesnt mean much its keeping a lot quiet these days 
 
 and they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters harry called across the table to mr weasley who shook his head 
 
 because they know i had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me 
 
 the latter i think scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that is as powerful as he is nor that azkabans seen a mass breakout 
 
 yeah why tell the public the truth said harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin i must not tell lies 
 
 isnt anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him asked ron angrily 
 
 of course ron but people are terrified mr weasley replied terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked there are nasty rumors going around i for one dont believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned she hasnt been seen for weeks now meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope hes working on a plan 
 
 there was a pause in which mrs weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart 
 
 we must decide ow you will be disguised arry said fleur once everyone had pudding for ze wedding she added when he looked confused of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne 
 
 from this harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid 
 
 yes good point said mrs weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment now ron have you cleaned out your room yet 
 
 why exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is 
 
 we are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man c 
 
 and are they getting married in my bedroom asked ron furiously no so why in the name of merlins saggy left c 
 
 dont talk to your mother like that said mr weasley firmly and do as youre told 
 
 ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart 
 
 i can help some of its my mess harry told ron but mrs weasley cut across him 
 
 no harry dear id much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens and hermione id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning 
 
 but as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens theres no need to er mention it to molly mr weasley told harry blocking his access to the coop but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of siriuss bike and er im hiding c thats to say keeping c it in here fantastic stuff theres an exhaust gaskin as i believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work im going to try and put it all back together again when mollys not c i mean when ive got time 
 
 when they returned to the house mrs weasley was nowhere to be seen so harry slipped upstairs to rons attic bedroom 
 
 im doing it im doing c oh its you said ron in relief as harry entered the room ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated the room was just as messy as it had been all week the only chance was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles 
 
 hi harry she said as he sat down on his camp bed 
 
 and how did you manage to get away 
 
 oh rons mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday said hermione she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other 
 
 we were just talking about ron told harry i reckon he might have survived 
 
 but bill saw him hit by the killing curse said harry 
 
 yeah but bill was under attack too said ron how can he be sure what he saw 
 
 even if the killing curse missed still fell about a thousand feet said hermione now weight quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand 
 
 he could have used a shield charm c 
 
 fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand said harry 
 
 well all right if you want him to be dead said ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape 
 
 of course we dont want him to be dead said hermione looking shocked its dreadful that hes dead but were being realistic 
 
 for the first time harry imagined body broken as dumbledores had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh 
 
 the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him said ron wisely 
 
 yeah said harry like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrids front garden they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him c 
 
 dont squealed hermione startled harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellmans syllabary 
 
 oh no said harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed hermione i wasnt trying to upset c 
 
 but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings ron bounded off the bed and got there first one arm around hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said tergeo 
 
 the wand siphoned off most of the grease looking rather pleased with himself ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione 
 
 oh thanks ron im sorry she blew her nose and hiccupped its just so isnt it after dumbledore i imagined dying somehow he seemed so tough 
 
 yeah i know said ron giving her a squeeze but you know what hed say to us if he was here 
 
 vigilance said hermione mopping her eyes 
 
 thats right said ron nodding hed tell us to learn from what happened to him and what ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books a second later ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped the monster of monsters on his foot the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at rons ankle 
 
 im sorry im sorry hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from rons leg and retied it shit 
 
 what are you doing with all those books anyway ron asked limping back to his bed 
 
 just trying to decide which ones to take with us said hermione when were looking for the horcruxes 
 
 oh of course said ron clapping a hand to his forehead i forgot well be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library 
 
 ha ha said hermione looking down at spellmans syllabary i wonder will we need to translate runes its possible i think wed better take it to be safe 
 
 she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts a history 
 
 listen said harry 
 
 he had sat up straight ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance 
 
 i know you said after dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me harry began 
 
 here he goes ron said to hermione rolling his eyes 
 
 as we knew he would he sighed turning back to the books you know i think i will take hogwarts a history even if were not going back there i dont think id feel right if i didnt have it with c 
 
 listen said harry again 
 
 no harry you listen said hermione were coming with you that was decided months ago c years really 
 
 but c 
 
 shut up ron advised him 
 
 c are you sure youve thought this through harry persisted 
 
 lets see said hermione slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling whole stock of polyjuice potion right under rons mums nose 
 
 ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to australia which they have now done thats to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me c or you because unfortunately ive told them quite a bit about you 
 
 assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes ill find mum and dad and lift the enchantment if i dont c well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy wendell and monica wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see 
 
 hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for ron to be teaching anyone else tact 
 
 i c hermione im sorry c i didnt c 
 
 didnt realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do ron show harry what youve done 
 
 nah hes just eaten said ron 
 
 go on he needs to know 
 
 oh all right harry come here 
 
 for the second time ron withdrew his arm from around hermione and stumped over to the door 
 
 cmon 
 
 why harry asked following ron out of the room onto the tiny landing 
 
 descendo muttered ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling a hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet a horrible sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains 
 
 thats your ghoul isnt it asked harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence 
 
 yeah it is said ron climbing the ladder come and have a look at him 
 
 harry followed ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space his head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open 
 
 but it it looks do ghouls normally wear pajamas 
 
 no said ron nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules 
 
 harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted it was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that harrys eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of rons pajamas he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters 
 
 hes me see said ron 
 
 no said harry i dont 
 
 ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me said ron they climbed back down the ladder which ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined hermione who was still sorting books 
 
 once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room said ron i think hes really looking forward to it c well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool c but he nods a lot when you mention it anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit good eh 
 
 harry merely looked his confusion 
 
 it is said ron clearly frustrated that harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan look when we three dont turn up at hogwarts again everyones going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are 
 
 but hopefully itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of are talking about going into hiding at the moment said hermione 
 
 we cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs said ron so were going to put out the story that im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i cant go back to school if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules spattergroits really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula 
 
 and your mum and dad are in on this plan asked harry 
 
 dad is he helped fred and george transform the ghoul mum well youve seen what shes like she wont accept were going till were gone 
 
 there was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other ron sat watching her and harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything the measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be he wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough 
 
 through the silence came the muffled sounds of mrs weasley shouting from four floors below 
 
 ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring said ron i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding 
 
 fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own said hermione as she pored indecisively over break with a banshee 
 
 well guests arent going to help mums stress levels said ron 
 
 what we really need to decide said hermione tossing defensive magical theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up an appraisal of magical education in europe is where were going after we leave here i know you said you wanted to go to godrics hollow first harry and i understand why but well shouldnt we make the horcruxes our priority 
 
 if we knew where any of the horcruxes were id agree with you said harry who did not believe that hermione really understood his desire to return to godrics hollow his parents graves were only part of the attraction he had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived voldemorts killing curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand 
 
 dont you think theres a possibility that voldemorts keeping a watch on godrics hollow hermione asked he might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like 
 
 this had not occurred to harry while he struggled to find a counterargument ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought 
 
 this person he said you know the one who stole the real locket 
 
 hermione nodded 
 
 he said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he 
 
 harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake horcrux in which note was still folded 
 
 i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can harry read out 
 
 well what if he did finish it off said ron 
 
 or she interposed hermione 
 
 whichever said ron itd be one less for us to do 
 
 yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we said hermione to find out whether or not its destroyed 
 
 and once we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux asked ron 
 
 well said hermione ive been researching that 
 
 how asked harry i didnt think there were any books on horcruxes in the library 
 
 there werent said hermione who had turned pink dumbledore removed them all but he c he didnt destroy them 
 
 ron sat up straight 
 
 how in the name of merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books 
 
 it c it wasnt stealing said hermione looking from harry to ron with a kind of desperation they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves anyway if he really didnt want anyone to get at them im sure he would have made it much harder to c 
 
 get to the point said ron 
 
 well it was easy said hermione in a small voice i just did a summoning charm you know c accio and c they zoomed out of dumbledores study window right into the girls dormitory 
 
 but when did you do this harry asked regarding hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity 
 
 just after his c dumbledores c funeral said hermione in an even smaller voice right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the horcruxes when i went back upstairs to get my things it c it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i was alone in there so i tried and it worked they flew straight in through the open window and i c i packed them 
 
 she swallowed and then said imploringly i cant believe dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a horcrux is it 
 
 can you hear us complaining said ron where are these books anyway 
 
 hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather she looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead 
 
 this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux secrets of the darkest art c its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library if he didnt do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here 
 
 why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed already read that asked ron 
 
 he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said harry dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them i think youre right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information 
 
 and the more ive read about them said hermione the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one horcrux 
 
 harry remembered what dumbledore had said about voldemort moving beyond usual evil 
 
 isnt there any way of putting yourself back together ron asked 
 
 yes said hermione with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingly painful 
 
 why how do you do it asked harry 
 
 remorse said hermione youve got to really feel what youve done theres a footnote apparently the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempting it somehow can you 
 
 no said ron before harry could answer so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book 
 
 yes said hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them from all that ive read what harry did to riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux 
 
 what stabbing it with a basilisk fang asked harry 
 
 oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then said ron i was wondering what we were going to do with them 
 
 it doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said hermione patiently it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux cant repair itself basilisk venom only has one antidote and its incredibly rare c 
 
 c phoenix tears said harry nodding 
 
 exactly said hermione our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux wont do the trick youve got to put it beyond magical repair 
 
 but even if we wreck the thing it lives in said ron why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else 
 
 because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being 
 
 seeing that harry and ron looked thoroughly confused hermione hurried on look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldnt damage your soul at all 
 
 which would be a real comfort to me im sure said ron harry laughed 
 
 it should be actually but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched said hermione but its the other way round with a horcrux the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival it cant exist without it 
 
 that diary sort of died when i stabbed it said harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of voldemorts soul as it vanished 
 
 and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new 
 
 hang on said ron frowning the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasnt it how does that work then 
 
 while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object i dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it she added before ron could speak i mean close emotionally ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux 
 
 i wonder how dumbledore destroyed the ring said harry why didnt i ask him i never really 
 
 his voice trailed away he was thinking of all the things he should have asked dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when dumbledore had been alive to find out more to find out everything 
 
 the silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a crash hermione shrieked and dropped secrets of the darkest art crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded chocolate frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at mrs weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage 
 
 im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering she said her voice trembling im sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help 
 
 oh yes said hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction we will were sorry 
 
 with an anguished look at harry and ron hermione hurried out of the room after mrs weasley 
 
 its like being a complained ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and harry followed except without the job satisfaction the sooner this weddings over the happier ill be 
 
 yeah said harry then well have nothing to do except find horcruxes itll be like a holiday wont it 
 
 ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in mrs weasleys room stopped quite abruptly 
 
 the delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o clock harry ron hermione and ginny were feeling quite resentful toward fleurs family by this time and it was with ill grace that ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and harry attempted to flatten his hair once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors 
 
 harry had never seen the place looking so tidy the rusty cauldrons and old wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect the chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes 
 
 he had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the burrow by both the order and the ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place mr weasley had therefore gone to meet the delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by portkey the first sound of their approach was an unusually laugh which turned out to be coming from mr weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leaf green robes who could be fleurs mother 
 
 maman cried fleur rushing forward to embrace her papa 
 
 monsieur delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plumb with a little pointed black beard however he looked bouncing towards mrs weasley on boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered 
 
 you ave been so much trouble he said in a deep voice fleur tells us you ave been working very ard 
 
 oh its been nothing nothing trilled mrs weasley no trouble at all 
 
 ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new flutterby bushes 
 
 dear lady said monsieur delacour still holding mrs weasleys hand between his own two plump ones and beaming we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families let me present my wife apolline 
 
 madame delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss mrs weasley too 
 
 enchante she said your usband as been telling us such amusing stories 
 
 mr weasley gave a maniacal laugh mrs weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend 
 
 and of course you ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle said monsieur delacour gabrielle was fleur in miniature eleven years old with hair of pure silvery blonde she gave mrs weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes ginny cleared her throat loudly 
 
 well come in do said mrs weasley brightly and she ushered the delacours into the house with many no and after and not at 
 
 the delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests they were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding monsieur delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids shoes charmant madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french 
 
 on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people mr and mrs weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percys old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house 
 
 but she still wont leave us alone snarled ron and their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of mrs weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms 
 
 oh good youve fed the chickens she called as she approached them wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow to put up the tent for the wedding she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse she looked exhausted millamants magic marquees theyre very good bills escorting them youd better stay inside while theyre here harry i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place 
 
 im sorry said harry humbly 
 
 oh dont be silly dear said mrs weasley at once i didnt mean c well your safetys much more important actually ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry seventeen after all its an important day 
 
 i dont want a fuss said harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all really mrs weasley just a normal dinner would be fine its the day before the wedding 
 
 oh well if youre sure dear ill invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid 
 
 thatd be great said harry but please dont go to loads of trouble 
 
 not at all not at all its no trouble 
 
 she looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a story 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the garden all the were in blossom they had 
 hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves and in 
 the yard all the ducklings walked up and down and the cat too it 
 basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own paws and 
 when one looked at the fields how beautifully the corn stood and 
 how green it shone without comparison and there was a twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds as if the day were a great 
 festival and so it was for it was sunday all the bells were 
 ringing and all the people went to church looking cheerful and 
 dressed in their best clothes there was a look of cheerfulness on 
 everything the day was so warm and beautiful that one might well have said kindness to us men is beyond all limits but inside 
 the church the pastor stood in the pulpit and spoke very loudly and 
 angrily he said that all men were wicked and god would punish them for their sins and that the wicked when they died would be cast into hell to burn for ever and ever he spoke very excitedly 
 saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed nor 
 would the fire be extinguished and they should never find rest 
 
 that was terrible to hear and he said it in such a tone of 
 conviction he described hell to them as a miserable hole where all 
 the refuse of the world gathers there was no air beside the hot 
 burning sulphur flame and there was no ground under their feet they 
 the wicked ones sank deeper and deeper while eternal silence 
 surrounded them it was dreadful to hear all that for the preacher 
 spoke from his heart and all the people in the church were terrified 
 meanwhile the birds sang merrily outside and the sun was shining 
 so beautifully warm it seemed as though every little flower said 
 god thy kindness towards us all is without limits indeed 
 outside it was not at all like the sermon 
 
 the same evening upon going to bed the pastor noticed his wife 
 sitting there quiet and pensive 
 
 what is the matter with you he asked her 
 well the matter with me is she said that i cannot collect my 
 thoughts and am unable to grasp the meaning of what you said in church that there are so many wicked people and that they 
 should burn eternally alas eternally how long i am only a woman 
 and a sinner before god but i should not have the heart to let even 
 the worst sinner burn for ever and how could our lord to do so who is so infinitely good and who knows how the wickedness comes from without and within no i am unable to imagine that although you say so 
 it was autumn the trees dropped their leaves the earnest and 
 severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person a pious 
 faithful soul closed her eyes for ever she was the wife 
 if any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our 
 lord you shall certainly do so said the pastor he folded her 
 hands and read a psalm over the dead woman 
 
 she was buried two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the 
 earnest man and in the parsonage it was empty and still for its 
 sun had set for ever she had gone home 
 
 it was night a cold wind swept over the head he 
 opened his eyes and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining 
 into his room it was not so however there was a being standing 
 before his bed and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife she 
 fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression just as 
 if she wished to say something to him the pastor raised himself in 
 bed and stretched his arms towards her saying not even you can find eternal rest you suffer you best and most pious woman 
 
 the dead woman nodded her head as if to say yes and put her 
 hand on her breast 
 
 and can i not obtain rest in the grave for you 
 yes was the answer 
 and how 
 give me one hair only one single hair from the head of the 
 sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished of the sinner 
 whom god will condemn to eternal punishment in hell 
 yes one ought to be able to redeem you so easily you pure 
 pious woman he said 
 
 follow me said the dead woman it is thus granted to us by my 
 side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish to go 
 invisible to men we shall penetrate into their most secret 
 chambers but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined 
 to eternal torture and before the cock crows he must be found as 
 quickly as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the great 
 city and from the walls the names of the deadly sins shone in flaming 
 letters pride avarice drunkenness wantonness in short the 
 whole bow of sin 
 
 yes therein as i believed as i knew it said the pastor are 
 living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire and they were 
 standing before the magnificently illuminated gate the broad steps 
 were adorned with carpets and flowers and dance music was sounding through the festive halls a footman dressed in silk and velvet stood with a large rod near the entrance 
 
 our ball can compare favourably with the he said and 
 turned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the street what he 
 thought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements 
 miserable beggars who are looking in you are nothing in 
 comparison to me 
 
 pride said the dead woman do you see him 
 the footman asked the pastor he is but a poor fool and not 
 doomed to be tortured eternally by fire 
 only a fool it sounded through the whole house of pride they 
 were all fools there 
 
 then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser lean as a 
 skeleton trembling with cold and hunger the old man was clinging 
 with all his thoughts to his money they saw him jump up feverishly 
 from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out of the wall there 
 lay gold coins in an old stocking they saw him anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn and his clammy fingers trembled 
 
 he is ill that is madness a joyless madness besieged by fear 
 and dreadful dreams 
 
 they quickly went away and came before the beds of the 
 criminals these unfortunate people slept side by side in long 
 rows like a ferocious animal one of them rose out of his sleep and 
 uttered a horrible cry and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs 
 with his pointed elbow and this one turned round in his sleep 
 be quiet monster sleep this happens every night 
 
 every night repeated the other yes every night he comes 
 and tortures me in my violence i have done this and that i was 
 born with an evil mind which has brought me hither for the second 
 time but if i have done wrong i suffer punishment for it one 
 thing however i have not yet confessed when i came out a little 
 while ago and passed by the yard of my former master evil thoughts 
 rose within me when i remembered this and that i struck a match a 
 little bit on the wall probably it came a little too close to the 
 thatched roof all burnt down a great heat rose such as sometimes 
 overcomes me i myself helped to rescue cattle and things nothing 
 alive burnt except a flight of pigeons which flew into the fire and 
 the yard dog of which i had not thought one could hear him howl 
 out of the fire and this howling i still hear when i wish to sleep 
 and when i have fallen asleep the great rough dog comes and places 
 himself upon me and howls presses and tortures me now listen to 
 what i tell you you can snore you are snoring the whole night and i 
 hardly a quarter of an hour and the blood rose to the head of the 
 excited criminal he threw himself upon his comrade and beat him with his clenced fist in the face 
 
 wicked matz has become mad again they said amongst 
 themselves the other criminals seized him wrestled with him and 
 bent him double so that his head rested between his knees and they 
 tied him so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out of all 
 his pores 
 
 you are killing the unfortunate man said the pastor and as 
 he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too 
 much the scene changed they flew through rich halls and wretched 
 hovels wantonness and envy all the deadly sins passed before 
 them an angel of justice read their crimes and their defence the 
 latter was not a brilliant one but it was read before god who 
 reads the heart who knows everything the wickedness that comes 
 from within and from without who is mercy and love personified 
 the hand trembled he dared not stretch it out he did not 
 venture to pull a hair out of the head and tears gushed from 
 his eyes like a stream of mercy and love the cooling waters of 
 which extinguished the eternal fire of hell 
 
 just then the cock crowed 
 
 father of all mercy grant thou to her the peace that i was 
 unable to procure for her 
 
 i have it now said the dead woman it was your hard words 
 your despair of mankind your gloomy belief in god and his creation 
 which drove me to you learn to know mankind even in the wicked one lives a part of god and this extinguishes and conquers the flame of hell 
 the pastor felt a kiss on his lips a gleam of light surrounded 
 him bright sun shone into the room and his wife alive 
 sweet and full of love awoke him from a dream which god had sent him 
 
 the end

 of parents children 
 the joys of parents are secret and so are their griefs and fears they cannot utter the one nor they will not utter the other children sweeten labours but they make misfortunes more bitter they increase the cares of life but they mitigate the 
 remembrance of death the perpetuity by generation is common to beasts but memory merit and noble works are proper to men and surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded from childless men which have sought to express the images of their minds where those of their bodies have failed so the care of posterity is most in them that have no posterity they that are the first raisers of are most indulgent towards their children beholding them as the continuance not only of their kind but of their work and so both children and creatures 
 the difference in affection of parents towards their several children is many times unequal and sometimes unworthy especially in the mother as solomon saith a wise son rejoiceth the father but an ungracious son shames the mother 
 a man shall see where there is a house full of children one or two of the eldest respected and the youngest made wantons but in the midst some mat are as it were forgotten who many times nevertheless prove the best the illiberality of parents in allowance towards their children is an harmful error makes them base acquaints them with shifts makes them sort with mean company and makes them surfeit more when they come to plenty and therefore the proof is best when men keep their authority towards their children but not their purse men have a foolish manner both parents and schoolmasters and servants in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers during childhood which many times sorted to discord when they are men and disturbed families the italians make little difference between children and nephews or near kinsfolk but so they be of the lump they care not though they passe not through 
 their own body and to say truth in nature it is much a like matter in so much 
 that we see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle or a kinsman more then his own parent as the blood happens let parents choose betimes the vocations and courses they mean their children should take for then they are most flexible and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children as thinking they will take best to mat which they have most mind to it is true that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary then it is good not to cross it but generally the precept is good optimum eli ge suave et facile illud faciet consuetude younger brothers are commonly fortunate but seldom or never where the elder are disinherited

 chapter ashley back home 
 
 home from their lost adventure came the lattered 
 cavaliers grimly they came hobbling back to the 
 desolation that had once been a land of grace and plenty 
 and with them came another invader more cruel and

 book just man 
 chapter vi 
 
 who guarded his house for him 
 the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above 
 behind the house was a garden a quarter of an acre in extent 
 the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below 
 the first room opening on the street served him as the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory 
 there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom without passing through the at the end of the suite in the oratory there was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality 
 the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to d 
 the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar 
 in addition to this there was in the garden a stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows 
 no matter what the quantity of milk they gave he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital 
 i am paying my tithes he said 
 his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather 
 as wood is extremely dear at d he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his winter salon 
 in this winter salon as in the there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four chairs in addition to this the was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink in water colors 
 out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory 
 his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor 
 the most beautiful of altars he said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking god 
 in his oratory there were two straw and there was an also in straw in his bedroom 
 when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect 
 or the general or the staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable the from the oratory and the from the bedroom 
 in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors 
 a room was dismantled for each new guest 
 it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer 
 there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall 
 mademoiselle baptistine had also in her own room a very large of wood which had formerly been gilded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture 
 mademoiselle ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in neck style with a sofa 
 but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing the idea 
 however who is there who has attained his ideal 
 nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bedchamber 
 a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serge in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the the bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded vases and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass door a large table with an inkstand loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an of straw in front of the bed a borrowed from the oratory 
 two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed 
 small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chaliot bishop of saint claude the other the abbe tourteau of agde abbe of order of citeaux diocese of chartres 
 when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them 
 they were priests and probably reasons for respecting them 
 all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day the th of april 
 madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of with four wafers 
 at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it 
 this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often called attention to it 
 how delightful that is he said 
 all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals 
 however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine as we shall see further on before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois 
 hence this decoration the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds 
 altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom 
 this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted he said that takes nothing from the poor 
 it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth and since we are now painting the bishop of d as he was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes 
 to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the when he had any one to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table 
 in the own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed 
 the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in radiating from a tank 
 another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it 
 these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box 
 in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot 
 it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken the beautiful is as useful as the useful 
 he added after a pause more so perhaps 
 this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books 
 he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds 
 he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him 
 moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus 
 he did not study plants he loved flowers he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects he watered his every summer evening with a tin painted green 
 the house had not a single door which could be locked 
 the door of the which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison 
 the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch 
 all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push 
 at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de d had said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you 
 they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it 
 madame magloire alone had frights from time to time 
 as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference 
 the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open 
 on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note 
 am not i a physician like them i also have my patients and then too i have some whom i call my unfortunates 
 again he wrote 
 do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you 
 the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter 
 it chanced that a worthy cure i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded 
 the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it 
 then he spoke of something else 
 he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of he added ours must be tranquil

 look over there luke kenobi ordered pointing to the southwest thelandspeeder continued to race over the gravelly desert floor beneath them should think 
 luke spared a glance at the indicated direction i see anything sir 
 angle over that way anyhow someone may be in trouble 
 luke turned the speeder before long the rising wisps of smoke that kenobihad somehow detected earlier became visible to him also 
 topping a slight rise the speeder dropped down a gentle slope into a canyon that was filled with twisted burned shapes some of them not dead in the center of this carnage and looking like a beached metal whalelay the shattered hulk of a jawa sandcrawler 
 luke brought the speeder to a halt kenobi followed him onto the sand andtogether they began to examine the detritus of destruction 
 several slight depressions in the sand caught attention walking a littlefaster he came up next to them and studied them for a moment before calling back tokenobi 
 looks like the sandpeople did it all right bantha tracks lukenoticed a gleam of metal in the sand and a piece of one ofthose big double axes of theirs he shook his head in confusion but i neverheard of the raiders hitting something this big he leaned back staring up at thetowering bulk of the sandcrawler 
 kenobi had passed him he was examining the broad huge footprints in thesand they he declared casually but they intended that anyoneelse who might happen onto think so luke moved up alongside him 
 i understand sir 
 look at these tracks carefully the older man directed him pointing down atthe nearest and then up at the others notice anything funny about them lukeshook his head whoever left here was riding banthas side by side sandpeoplealways ride one bantha behind another single file to hide their strength from anydistant observers 
 leaving luke to gape at the parallel sets of tracks kenobi turned his attention tothe sandcrawler he pointed out where single weapons bursts had blasted awayportals treads and support beams look at the precision with which this firepowerwas applied sandpeople this accurate in fact no one on tatooine fires anddestroys with this kind of efficiency turing he examined the horizon one ofthose nearby bluffs concealed a a threat only imperial troops wouldmount an attack on a sandcrawler with this kind of cold accuracy 
 luke had walked over to one of the small crumpled bodies and kicked it overonto its back his face screwed up in distaste as he saw what remained of the pitifulcreature 
 these are the same jawas who sold uncle owen and me artoo and recognize this cloak design why would imperial troops be slaughteringjawas and sandpeople they must have killed some raider to get those mind worked furiously and he found himself growing unnaturally tense as hestared back at the landspeeder past the rapidly deteriorating corpses of the jawas 
 butif they tracked the droids to the jawas then they had to learn first whothey sold them to they would lead them back to luke was sprinting insanelyfor the landspeeder 
 luke waitwait luke kenobi called too dangerous 
 luke heard nothing except the roaring in his ears felt nothing save the burningin his heart he jumped into the speeder and was throwing the accelerator full overalmost simultaneously in an explosion of sand and gravel he left kenobi and thetwo robots standing alone in the midst of smoldering bodies framed by the stillsmoking wreck of the sandcrawler 
 the smoke that luke saw as he drew near the homestead was of a differentconsistency from that which had boiled out of the jawa machine he barelyremembered to shut down the engine as he popped the cockpit canopyand threw himself out dark smoke was drifting steadily from holes in the ground 
 those holes had been his home the only one he had ever known they mightas well have been throats of small volcanoes now again and again he tried topenetrate the surface entrances to the belowground complex again and again heat drove him back coughing and choking 
 weakly he found himself stumbling clear his eyes watering not entirely from thesmoke half blinded he staggered over to the exterior entrance to the garage ittoo was burning but perhaps they managed to escape in the other landspeeder 
 aunt beruuncle owen it was difficult to make out much of anythingthrough the haze two smoking shapes showed down the tunnel barelyvisible through tears and haze they almost looked like he squinted angrily at his uncooperative eyes 
 no 
 then he was spinning away falling to his stomach and burying his face in thesand so he have to look anymore 
 the tridimensional solid screen filled one wall of the vast chamber from floor toceiling it showed a million star systems a tiny portion of the galaxy but animpressive display nonetheless when exhibited in such a fashion 
 below far below the huge shape of darth vader stood flanked on one side bygovernor tarkin and on the other by admiral motti and general tagge their privateantagonisms forgotten in the awesomeness of this moment 
 the final checkout is complete motti informed them all systems areoperational he turned to the others what shall be the first course we set 
 vader appeared not to have heard as he mumbled softly half to himself she hasa surprising amount of control her resistance to the interrogator is glanced down at tarkin it will be some time before we can extract any usefulinformation from her 
 always found the methods you recommend rather quaint vader 
 they are efficient the dark lord argued softly in the interest ofaccelerating the procedure however i am open to your suggestions 
 tarkin looked thoughtful such stubbornness can often be detoured byapplying threats to something other than the one involved 
 what do you mean 
 only that i think is time we demonstrated the full power of this station wemay do so in a fashion doubly useful he instructed the attentive motti tell yourprogrammers to set course for the alderaan system 
 pride did not prevent him from wrapping an old scarf over nose andmouth to filter out a portion of the drifting putrid odor though possessedof olfactory sensory apparatus artoo detoo and threepio had no need of such ascreen even threepio who was equipped to discriminate among aromaticaesthetics could be artificially selective when he so desired 
 working together the two droids helped kenobi throw the last of the bodiesonto the blazing pyre then stood back and watched the dead continue to burn notthat the desert scavengers have been equally efficient in picking the sandcrawler clean of flesh but kenobi retained values most modern men wouldhave deemed archaic he would consign no one to the and not even a filthy jawa 
 at a rising thrumming kenobi turned from the residue of the noisome business tosee the landspeeder approaching now traveling at a sensible pace far different fromwhen it had left it slowed and hovered nearby but showed no signs of life 
 gesturing for the two robots to follow ben started toward the waiting canopy flipped open and up to reveal luke sitting motionless in the look up at inquiring glance that in itself was enough to tell theold man what had happened 
 i share your sorrow luke he finally ventured softly there was nothing youcould have done had you been there be dead now too and the droidswould be in the hands of the imperials not even the force 
 damn your force luke snarled with sudden violence now he turned andglared at kenobi there was a set to his jaw that belonged on a much older face 
 take you to the spaceport at mos eisley ben i want to go with nothing left for me here now his eyes turned to look outacross the desert to focus on something beyond sand and rock and canyon walls iwant to learn to be like a jedi like my father i want he paused the wordsbacking up like a logjam in his throat 
 kenobi slid into the cockpit put a hand gently on the shoulder then wentforward to make room for the two robots do my best to see that you get whatyou want luke for now go to mos eisley 
 luke nodded and closed the canopy the landspeeder moved away to thesoutheast leaving behind the sandcrawler the jawa funeral pyre andthe only life luke had ever known 
 leaving the speeder parked near the edge of the sandstone bluff luke and benwalked over and peered down at the tiny regularized bumps erupting from the plain below the haphazard collage of concrete stone and plastoidstructures spread outward from a central plant like thespokes of a wheel 
 actually the town was considerably larger than it appeared since a good portionof it lay underground looking like bomb craters from this distance the smoothcircular depressions of launch stations pockmarked the cityscape 
 a brisk gale was scouring the tired ground it whipped the sand about and legs as he adjusted his protective goggles 
 there it is kenobi murmured indicating the unimpressive collection ofbuildings mos eisley ideal place for us to lose ourselves while weseek passage offplanet not a more wretched collection of villainy and disreputabletypes exists anywhere on tatooine the empire has been alerted to us so we mustbe very cautious luke the population of mos eisley should disguise us well 
 luke wore a determined look ready for anything 
 i wonder if you comprehend what that might entail luke kenobi thought buthe only nodded as he led the way back to the landspeeder 
 unlike anchorhead there were enough people in mos eisley to requiremovement in the heat of day built from the beginning with commerce in the oldest of the buildings had been designed to provide protection fromthe twin suns they looked primitive from the outside and many were butoftentimes walls and arches of old stone masked durasteel double walls withcirculating coolant flowing freely between 
 luke was maneuvering the landspeeder through the outskirts whenseveral tall gleaming forms appeared from nowhere and began to close a circlearound him for one panicked moment he considered gunning the engine and racingthrough the pedestrians and other vehicles a startlingly firm grip on his arm bothrestrained and relaxed him he glanced over to see kenobi smiling warning him 
 so they continued at a normal town cruising speed luke hoping that the imperialtroops were bent on business elsewhere no such luck one of the troopers raisedan armored hand luke had no choice but to respond as he pulled the speederover he grew aware of the attention they were receiving from curious yet it seemed that the attention was in fact reserved not for kenobi orhimself but for the two unmoving robots seated in the speeder behind them 
 how long have you had these droids the trooper who had raised his handbarked polite formalities were to be dispensed with it appeared 
 looking blank for a second luke finally came up with three or four seasons iguess 
 up for sale if you want the price is right kenobi put a wonderful impression of a dessert finagler out to cajole a few quick creditsfrom ignorant imperials 
 the trooper in charge did not deign to reply he was absorbed in a thoroughexamination of the underside 
 did you come in from the south he asked 
 nono luke answered quickly we live in the west near bestine township 
 bestine the trooper murmured walking around to study the forced himself to stare straight ahead finally the armored figure concludedhis examination he moved to stand ominously close to luke and snapped let mesee your identification 
 surely the man sensed his terror and nervousness by now luke thought resolution of not long before to be ready to take on anything had alreadydisintegrated under the unwinking stare of this professional soldier he knew whatwould happen if they got a look at his formal id with the location of his homesteadand the name of his nearest relatives on it something seemed to be buzzing insidehis head he felt faint 
 kenobi had leaned over and was talking easily to the trooper you needto see his identification the old man informed the imperial in an extremely peculiarvoice 
 staring blankly back at him the officer replied as if it were i to see your identification his reaction was the opposite of hisvoice was normal but his expression peculiar 
 these the droids looking for kenobi told him pleasantly 
 these the droids looking for 
 he can go about his business 
 you can go about your business the officer informed luke 
 the expression of relief that spread across face ought to have been asrevealing as his previous nervousness but the imperial ignored it 
 move along kenobi whispered 
 move along the officer instructed luke 
 unable to decide whether he should salute nod or give thanks to the man lukesettled for nudging the accelerator the landspeeder moved forward drawing awayfrom the circle of troops as they prepared to round a corner luke risked a glancebackward the officer who had inspected them appeared to be arguing with severalcomrades though at this distance luke be sure 
 he peered up at his tall companion and started to say something kenobiseemed to have some idea where they were headed luke studied the and equally individuals they were passing theyhad entered the oldest section of mos eisley and consequently the one where the oldvices flourished most strongly 
 kenobi pointed and luke pulled the landspeeder up in front of what appeared tobe one of the original first blockhouses it had been converted into acantina whose clientele was suggested by the diverse nature of transport parkedoutside some of them luke recognized others he had only heard rumors of thecantina itself he knew from the design of the building must lie partially underground 
 as the dusty but still sleek craft pulled into an open spot a jawa materializedfrom nowhere and began running covetous hands over the metal sides luke leanedout and barked something harsh at the which caused it to scurry away 
 i abide those jawas murmured threepio with lofty creatures 
 mind was too full of their narrow escape for him to comment sentiments i still understand how we got by these troops ithought we were as good as dead 
 the force is in the mind luke and can sometime be used to influence a powerful ally but as you come to know the force you will discover that it canalso be a danger 
 nodding without really understanding luke indicated the thoughobviously popular cantina do you really think we can find a pilot here capable oftaking us all the way to alderaan 
 kenobi was exiting from the speeder most of the good independent freighterpilots frequent this place though many can afford better they can talk freely should have learned by now luke not to equate ability with appearance lukesaw the old shabby clothing anew and felt ashamed watch yourself place can be rough 
 luke found himself squinting as they entered the cantina it was darker insidethan he would have liked perhaps the regular habitus of this place wereunaccustomed to the light of day or wish to be seen clearly it occur toluke that the dim interior in combination with the brilliantly lit entrance permittedeveryone inside to see each newcomer before he could see them 
 moving inward luke was astonished at the variety of beings making use of thebar there were creatures and creature with with fur and some with skin that seemed to ripple and change consistencyaccording to their feelings of the moment 
 hovering near the bar itself was a towering insectoid that luke glimpsed only asa threatening shadow it contrasted with two of the tallest women luke had everseen they were among the most normal looking of the outrageous assemblage ofhumans that mixed freely among alien counterparts tentacles claws and handswere wrapped around drinking utensils of various sizes and shapes conversationwas a steady babble of human and alien tongues 
 leaning close kenobi gestured toward the far end of the bar a small knot humans lounged there drinking laughing and trading stories ofdubious origin 
 most likely 
 i thought we were looking for an independent freighter captain with his ownship for hire luke whispered back 
 so we are young luke so we are agreed kenobi and bound to beone or two adequate for our needs among that group just that in corellianterminology the distinction between who owns what cargo tends to get a littlemuddled from time to time wait here 
 luke nodded and watched as kenobi worked his way through the crowd thecorrellians suspicion at his approach vanished as soon as he engaged them inconversation 
 something grabbed shoulder and spun him around 
 hey looking around and struggling to regain his composure he foundhimself staring up at an enormous human luke saw by the that he must be the bartender if not the owner of this cantina 
 we serve their kind in here the glaring form growled 
 what luke replied dumbly he still recovered from his suddensubmergence into the cultures of several dozen races it was rather different fromthe poolroom behind the anchorhead power station your droids the bartenderexplained impatiently gesturing with a thick thumb luke peered in the indicateddirection to see artoo and threepio standing quietly nearby have to waitoutside we serve them in here i only carry stuff for organics not heconcluded with an expression of distaste mechanicals 
 luke like the idea of kicking threepio and artoo out but he knowhow else to deal with the problem the bartender appear to be the sort whowould readily respond to reason and when he looked around for old ben luke sawthat he was locked in deep conversation with one of the corellians 
 meanwhile the discussion had attracted the attention of several types who happened to be clustered within hearing range alwere regarding luke and the two droids in a decidedly unfriendly fashion 
 yes of course luke said realizing this the time or place to force theissue of droid rights sorry he looked over at threepio betterstay outside with the speeder we want any trouble in here 
 i heartily agree with you sir threepio said his gaze traveling past luke andthe bartender to take in the unfriendly stares at the bar i feel the need forlubrication at the moment anyway with artoo waddling in his wake the tall robothastily headed for the exit 
 that finished things as far as the bartender was concerned but luke now foundhimself the subject of some unwanted attention he abruptly became aware of hisisolation and felt as if at one time or another every eye in the place rested a momenton him that things human and otherwise were smirking and making comments abouthim behind his back 
 trying to maintain an air of quiet confidence he returned his gaze to old started when he saw what the oldster was talking to now the corellian wasgone in its place kenobi was chatting with a towering anthropoid that showed amouthful of teeth when it smiled 
 luke had heard about wookies but he had never expected to see one much lessmeet on despite an almost comical face the wookie was anythingbut gentle looking only the large glowing yellow eyes softened its otherwiseawesome appearance the massive torso was covered entirely with soft thick russetfur less appealing cover consisted of a pair of chromed bandoliers which heldlethal projectiles of a type unknown to luke other than these the wookies luke knew that anyone would laugh at the mode of dress he sawthat other denizens of the bar eddied and swirled around the huge form without evercoming too close all but old who was talking to the wookie in its ownlanguage quarreling and hooting softly like a native 
 in the course of the conversation the old man had occasion to gesture in once the huge anthropoid stared directly at luke and let out a horrifyinghowling laugh 
 disgruntled by the role he was evidently playing in the discussion luke turnedaway and pretended to ignore the whole conversation he might be acting unfairlytoward the creature but he doubted that laugh was meant in 
 for the life of him he understand what ben wanted with the monster orwhy he was spending his time in guttural conversation with it instead of with the corellians so he sat and sipped his drink in splendid silence his eyesroving over the crowd in hopes of meeting a responsive gaze that held no belligerence 
 suddenly something shoved him roughly from behind so hard he almost turned angrily but his fury spent itself in astonishment he found himselfconfronted by a large squarish monstrosity of multiple eyes and indeterminate origin 
 negola dewaghi wooldugger the apparition bubbled challengingly 
 luke had never seen its like before he knew neither its species nor its gabbling might have been an invitation to a fight a request to share a drink or amarriage proposal despite his ignorance however luke could tell by the way thecreature bobbed and wove unsteadily on its podal supports that it had imbibed toomuch of whatever it considered a pleasing intoxicant 
 not knowing what else to do luke tried turning back to his own drink whilestudiously ignoring the creature as he did so a cross between a capybaraand a small over to stand or squat next to the quivering short companionable arm around the snuffling mass 
 he like you the stubby human informed luke in a surprisingly deepvoice 
 sorry about that luke admitted wishing heartily he were somewhere else 
 i like you either the smiling little man went on with brotherly negativity 
 i said i was sorry about it 
 whether from the conversation it was having with the creature or theoverdose of booze the apartment house for wayward eyeballs was obviously growingagitated it leaned forward almost toppling into luke and spewed a stream ofunintelligible gibberish at him luke felt the eyes of a crowd on him as he grewincreasingly more nervous 
 sorry the human mimicked derisively clearly deep into his own cups areyou insulting us you just better watch yourself all wanted heindicated his drunken companions i have the death sentence on me in twelvedifferent systems 
 be careful then luke muttered 
 the little man was smiling broadly be dead 
 at this the rodent let out a loud grunt it was either a signal or a everything human or otherwise which had been leaning up at the barimmediately backed away leaving a clear space around luke and his antagonists 
 trying to salvage the situation luke essayed a wan smile that faded rapidlywhen he saw that the three were readying hand weapons not only he havecountered all three of them he had no idea what a couple of the devicesdid 
 this little one worth the trouble a calm voice said luke looked he heard kenobi come up alongside him come let me buy youall something 
 by way of reply the bulky monster chittered hideously and swung out a massivelimb it caught an unprepared luke across the temple and sent him spinning acrossthe room crashing through tables and shattering a large jug filled with a 
 the crowd edged back farther a few grunts and warning snorts coming fromsome of them as the drunken monstrosity pulled a pistol from itsservice pouch he started to wave it in direction 
 that spurred the bartender to life he came chargingclumsily around the end of the bar waving his hands frantically but still taking care tostay out of range 
 no blasters no blasters not in my place 
 the rodent thing chattered threateningly at him while the weapon spared him a warning grunt 
 in the split second when the gun and its attention was off him the hand had moved to the disk slung at his side the short human started to yellas a fiery light appeared in the dimness of the cantina 
 he never finished the yell it turned into a blink when the blink was man found himself lying prone against the bar moaning and whimpering as hestared at the stump of an arm 
 in between the start of his yell and the conclusion of the blink the been cleft cleanly in half down the middle its two halves falling in oppositedirections the giant multiocular creature still stood staring dazed at the old humanwho was poised motionless before it the shining lightsaber held over his head in apeculiar fashion the chrome pistol fired once blowing a hole in the the torso peeled away as neatly as had the body of the rodent its two cauterizedsection falling in opposite directions to lie motionless on the cool stone 
 only then did the suggestion of a sigh escape from kenobi only then did hisbody appear to relax bringing the lightsaber down he flipped it carefully upward ina reflex saluting motion which ended with the deactivated weapon restinginnocuously on his hip 
 that final movement broke the total quiet which had enshrouded the resumed as did the movement of bodies in chairs the scraping ofmugs and pitchers and other drinking devices on tabletops the bartender andseveral assistants appeared to drag the unsightly corpses out of the room while themutilated human vanished wordlessly into the crowd cradling the stump of his gunarm and counting himself fortunate 
 to all appearances the cantina had returned to its former state with one smallexception ben kenobi was given a respectful amount of space at the bar 
 luke barely heard the renewed conversation he was still shaken by the speedof the fight and by the old unimagined abilities as his mind cleared and hemoved to rejoin kenobi he could overhear bits and snatches of the talk around of it centered on admiration for the cleanness and finality of the fight 
 hurt luke kenobi observed solicitously 
 luke felt of the bruise where the big creature had stuck him i he started tosay but old ben cut him off as if nothing had happened he indicated the greathairy mass which was shouldering its way through the crowd toward them 
 this is chewbacca he explained when the anthropoid had joined them at thebar first mate on a ship that might suit our needs take us to now 
 this way the wookie least it sounded something like that to any case the huge gesture was unmistakable they startedto wend their way deeper into the bar the wookie parting the crowd like a gravelstorm cutting canyonettes 
 out in front of the cantina threepio paced nervously next to the unconcerned artoo detoo was engaged in animated electronicconversation with a bright red r unit be longing to another of the patrons 
 what could be taking them so long they went to hire one a fleet 
 abruptly threepio paused beckoning silently for artoo to be quiet twoimperial troopers had appeared on the scene they were met by an unkempt humanwho had emerged almost simultaneously from the depths of the cantina 
 i do not like the looks of this the tall droid murmured 
 luke had appropriated someone drink from a tray as they madetheir way to the rear of the cantina he gulped at it with the giddy air of one whofeels himself under diving protection that safe he was not but in the company ofkenobi and the giant wookie he began to feel confident that no one in the bar wouldassault him with so much as a dirty look 
 in a rear booth they encountered a young man perhaps five yearsolder than luke perhaps a was difficult to tell he displayed the opennessof the utterly the insanely reckless at their approach the man sent thehumanoid wench who had been wriggling on his lap on her way with a whisperedsomething which left a wide if inhuman grin on her face 
 the wookie chewbacca rumbled something at the man and he nodded inresponse glancing up at the newcomers pleasantly 
 pretty handy with that saber old man not often does one see that kindof swordplay in this part of the empire anymore he downed a prodigious portionof whatever filled his mug han solo captain of the millennium he became all business chewie tells me looking for passage tothe alderaan system 
 right son if on a fast ship kenobi told him solo bridleat the son 
 fast ship you mean never heard of the millennium falcon 
 kenobi appeared amused should i 
 the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve standard told him indignantly outrun imperial starships and corellian cruisers ithink fast enough for you old man his outrage subsided rapidly cargo 
 only passengers myself the boy and two questions asked 
 no questions solo regarded his mug finally looked up is it local trouble 
 just say like to avoid any imperial entanglements kenobi repliedeasily 
 these days that can be a real trick cost you a little extra he did somemental figuring all in all about ten thousand in advance he added with asmile and no questions asked 
 luke gaped at the pilot ten thousand we could almost buy our own shipfor that 
 solo shrugged maybe you could and maybe you in any you fly it 
 you bet i could luke shot back rising not such a bad pilot myself 
 again the firm hand on his arm we that much with us kenobiexplained but we could pay you two thousand now plus another fifteen when wereach alderaan 
 solo leaned forward uncertainly fifteenyou can really get your hands onthat kind of money 
 i promise the government on alderaan itself at the worst earned an honest fee two thousand 
 but solo seemed not to hear the last seventeen thousandall right it got yourselves a ship as for avoiding imperial better twist out of here or even the millennium falcon be any help toyou he nodded toward the cantina entrance and added quickly docking first thing in the morning 
 four imperial troopers their eyes darting rapidly from table to booth to bar hadentered the cantina there was muttering from among the crowd but whenever theeyes of one of the heavily armed troopers went hunting for the mutterers the wordsdied with sullen speed 
 moving to the bar the officer in charge asked the bartender a couple of briefquestions the big man hesitated a moment then pointed toward a place near theback of the room as he did so his eyes widened slightly those of the officerwere unreadable 
 the booth he was pointing to was empty

 chapter vii 
 
 the rustle of a dress was heard in the next room prince andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had in anna drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her 
 how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are monsieur pierre 
 and i am still arguing with your husband i understand why he wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women 
 the princess started evidently words touched her to the quick 
 ah that is just what i tell him said she i understand it i in the least understand why men live without wars how is it that we women want anything of the kind need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here he is a most brilliant position he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well received everywhere he might easily become to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think 
 pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no reply 
 when are you starting he asked 
 oh speak of his going i hear it spoken of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband afraid afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her back 
 her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness 
 what is it you are afraid of lise i understand said he 
 there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country 
 with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently 
 alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be afraid 
 her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal expression she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that 
 i still understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife 
 the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair 
 no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have 
 your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you had better go 
 the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room 
 pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind 
 why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no pity for me why is it 
 lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words but she went on hurriedly 
 you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave like that six months ago 
 lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically 
 pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself 
 calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i myself have experienced and so because no excuse me an outsider is out of place here no distress yourself 
 prince andrew caught him by the hand 
 no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you 
 no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears 
 lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted 
 suddenly the angry expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her face and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail 
 mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead 
 good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger

 chapter 
 
 cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks till christmas by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there alighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why cathy you are quite a beauty i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now isabella linton is not to be compared with her is she frances 
 isabella has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here ellen help miss catherine off with her dear you will disarrange your me untie your hat 
 i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments she kissed me gently i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for heathcliff mr and mrs earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends 
 heathcliff was hard to discover at first if he were careless and uncared for before absence he had been ten times more so since nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a counterpart of himself as he expected is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors 
 heathcliff you may come forward cried mr hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself you may come and wish miss catherine welcome like the other servants 
 cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross you look and funny and grim but because used to edgar and isabella linton well heathcliff have you forgotten me 
 she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable 
 shake hands heathcliff said mr earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted 
 i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at i shall not bear it 
 and he would have broken from the circle but miss cathy seized him again 
 i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself heathcliff shake hands at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty 
 she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his 
 you have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty 
 with that he dashed head foremost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper 
 after playing to the newcomer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmas eve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr and mrs earnshaw were engaging attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs linton begged that her darlings must be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy 
 under these circumstances i remained solitary i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular scoured and floor i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom 
 make haste heathcliff i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is upstairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime 
 he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me 
 you coming i continued a little cake for each of you nearly enough and need half an donning 
 i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him catherine supped with her brother and joseph and i joined in an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies he managed to continue work till nine and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his ill humour on to the moors not reappearing till the family were departed for church fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptly 
 nelly make me decent going to be good 
 high time heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine sorry she ever came home i dare say it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you 
 the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough 
 did she say she was grieved he inquired looking very serious she cried when i told her you were off again this morning 
 well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she 
 yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in you must go up and offer to kiss her and know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress and now though i have dinner to get ready steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does you are younger and yet be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling you feel that you could 
 face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed 
 but nelly if i knocked him down twenty times that make him less handsome or me more so i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be 
 and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain oh heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit come to the glass and let you see what you should wish do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their windows boldly but lurk glinting under them like spies wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers 
 in other words i must wish for edgar great blue eyes and even forehead he replied i that help me to them 
 a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly and now that done washing and combing and me whether you think yourself rather handsome tell you i do fit for a prince in disguise who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one income wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer 
 so i chattered on and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter catherine took a hand of each of the children and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces 
 i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side hindley opened it on the other they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the him into the garret till dinner is over be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute 
 nay sir i could not avoid answering touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we 
 he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs again till dark cried hindley begone you vagabond what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant if i pull them a bit longer 
 they are long enough already observed master linton peeping from the doorway i wonder they make his head ache like a mane over his eyes 
 he ventured his remark without any intention to insult but violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his gripe and dashed it full against the face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place mr earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he reappeared red and breathless i got the and rather spitefully scrubbed nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling his sister began weeping to go home and cathy stood by confounded blushing for all 
 you should not have spoken to him she expostulated with master linton he was in a bad temper and now spoilt your visit and be flogged i hate him to be flogged i eat my dinner why did you speak to him edgar 
 i sobbed the youth escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief i promised mamma that i say one word to him and i 
 well cry replied catherine contemptuously not killed make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet give over isabella has anybody hurt you 
 there there your seats cried hindley bustling in that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely next time master edgar take the law into your own will give you an appetite 
 the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them mr earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine with dry eyes and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old troubles i could not have imagined her to be so selfish she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion i did not cal her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory through out the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to heathcliff who had been locked up b the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him private mess of victuals 
 in the evening we had a dance cathy begged that he might b liberated then as isabella linton had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoon french horns and a bass viol besides singers they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a treat to hear them after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees mrs earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty 
 catherine loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark i followed they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full people she made no stay at the head but mounted farther to the garret where heathcliff was confined and called him i stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again when she did come heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my had gone to a to be removed from the sound of our psalmody as it pleased him to call it i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since dinner i would wink at his cheating mr hindley that once he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and remained wrapt in dumb meditation on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravely 
 trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back i care how long i wait if i can only do it at last i hope he will not die before i do 
 for shame heathcliff said i it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive 
 no god have the satisfaction that i shall he returned i only wish i knew the best way let me alone and plan it out while thinking of that i feel pain 
 but mr lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed i could have told heathcliffs history all that you need hear in half a dozen words 
 thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose arid proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding sit still mrs dean i cried do sit still another done just right to tell the story leisurely that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less 
 the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir 
 no not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten 
 you lie till ten the very prime of the morning gone long before that time a person who has not done one half his work by ten runs a chance of leaving the other half undone 
 nevertheless mrs dean resume your chair because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least 
 i hope not sir well you must allow me to leap over some three years during that space mrs earnshaw 
 no no allow nothing of the sort are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper 
 a terribly lazy mood i should say 
 on the contrary a tiresomely active one it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that the spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a standing one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance 
 oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us observed mrs dean somewhat puzzled at my speech 
 excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles 
 mrs dean laughed 
 i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from end to end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr lockwood you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor daughter however if i am to follow my story in true fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three years i will be content to pass to the next summer of that is nearly years ago

 chapter seven 
 
 that boy is a perfect cyclops he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed 
 how dare you say so when got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend 
 i day anything about his eyes and i see why you need fire up when i admire his riding 
 oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter you be so rude only a lapse of lingy as mr davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear 
 why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at second blunder 
 i need it so much dreadfully in debt and it be my turn to have the rag money for a month 
 in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober 
 why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop 
 tell me all about it are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important 
 why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too nothing but limes now for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils bead rings paper dolls or something else at recess if one girl likes another she gives her a lime if mad with her she eats one before her face and offer even a suck they treat by turns and had ever so many but returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know 
 how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse 
 a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you you like limes 
 not much you may have my share the money make it last as long as you can for it very plenty you know 
 oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocket money have a grand feast for i tasted a lime this week i felt delicate about taking any as i return them and actually suffering for one 
 next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twenty four delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other limes and people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow hopes by the withering telegram you be so polite all of a sudden for you get any 
 a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk 
 now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity 
 young ladies attention if you please 
 at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance 
 miss march come to the desk 
 amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience 
 bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat 
 take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind 
 amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath 
 is that all 
 not quite stammered amy 
 bring the rest immediately 
 with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed 
 you are sure there are no more 
 i never lie sir 
 so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window 
 there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears 
 as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner 
 young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand 
 amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the fate 
 your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw bach her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down 
 you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun 
 that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them 
 during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me 
 the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before 
 you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable 
 he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle 
 no notice was taken of flight except by her mates but the demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook that dust of the place off her feet 
 yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr manner of teaching and think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your advice before i send you anywhere else 
 good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr 
 i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy 
 do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy 
 i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but not sure that it do you more good than a molder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty 
 so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and have believed it if anyone had told her 
 i wish known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly 
 you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery 
 jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy 
 yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother 
 and he conceited is he asked amy 
 not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much i see nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully 
 these things are always seen and felt in a manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march 
 any more than proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh

 evelyn and jonathan race up the staircase 
 just ahead of the mass of scurrying chittering scarabs

 the narrow stairway the horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
 scurries between them their critters send 
 shivers up spine she leans back the wall moves

 moonlight filters in through a crack in the ceiling a man 
 stands in the middle of the room evelyn walks towards him 
 evelyn 
 oh thank goodness one 
 of the americans you 
 just as she reaches him he turns around burns both of 
 his eyes are missing he stares at her with vacant sockets 
 evelyn screams in horror and backs away hyperventilating 
 she bumps into something she screams again and spins around 
 imhotep with two fresh eyeballs in his sockets 
 
 evelyn screams again and backs away into a wall her hair is 
 down her face is dirty and sweaty her blouse is ripped her 
 dress is torn never looked sexier imhotep squints 
 imhotep 
 
 labyrinth staircase night 
 is feeling his way around inside the grotto

 and then they heat men screaming and suddenly henderson 
 daniels and one of the diggers come running down the stairs 
 henderson 
 run you ruuuun 
 and jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
 chittering scarabs coming their way the digger suddenly 
 trips and falls slows down about to go back and 
 help him but too late the digger screams in horror as 
 the herd of scarabs run over him eating straight through 
 him leaving behind the half eaten skeleton daniels 
 henderson and jonathan react in horror already 
 running races right past them the others turn and 
 scarab chamber night 
 imhotep steps forward the sand around him seems to 
 magnetize swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
 legs evelyn starts backing away horrified looks at burns 
 evelyn 
 help me please help me 
 burns opens his mouth but can only gurgle and moan because 
 his tongue is missing imhotep grabs him throws him to the 
 ground and sets his skeletal foot on burns chest like a big 
 game hunter standing on his kill imhotep then parts his 
 fetid lips a fresh tongue flaps between his rotted teeth 
 imhotep 
 kadeesh pharos 
 evelyn shivers in fear suddenly comes flying 
 around the corner and runs right up to her 
 
 would you quit playin around 
 get outta here already 
 sees the look in her eyes and turns around at 
 the sight of imhotep jumps back in fright 
 
 whoa 
 and evelyn start backing away down the wall 
 imhotep glides sideways with them like a tiger cornering his 
 prey the sand around him swirls and dances burns starts to 
 crawl away whimpering as he goes imhotep suddenly stops and 
 unhinges his skeletal jaw his skinless mouth stretches to an 
 inhuman size and he lets out a horrific primordial shriek 
 imhotep 
 
 evelyn screams shudders then embarrassed by his 
 fear he opens his own mouth and roars right back at him 
 
 ahhhhhhhh 
 then blasts him with the elephant gun blam through the 
 smoke and flammage we see imhotep blown off his feet his 
 ribcage half torn away grabs evelyn and runs 
 ext crevice night 
 sand and wind whip through the ruins as and evelyn 
 stumble up out of the crevice and come with ten 
 armed mumia the mumia quickly raise their guns 
 and evelyn quickly raise their hands jonathan henderson 
 daniels and the egyptologist are already on their knees 
 hands over their heads ardeth bay steps forward

 creature the walking corpse 
 really big mouth really bad breath 
 int anubis chamber night 
 beni sloway backs up around anubis eyes wide gun up he 
 turns around imhotep is right there beni screams backs 
 away and opens fire six gunshots perforate imhotep but have 
 no effect except to splatter molten flesh rot onto the back 
 wall beni retreats into a corner scared shitless imhotep 
 moves forward his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy 
 guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side 
 beni drops his gun and grabs at the chains around his neck 
 religious symbols and icons dangle from each chain beni 
 holds the first one up a christian crucifix he quickly 
 makes the sign cross and blesses himself in english 
 beni 
 may the good lord protect and watch 
 over me as a shepherd watches over 
 his flock and may satan in all his 
 forms be vanquished forever 
 it has no effect on imhotep who continues forward beni 
 quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons holding them 
 out towards imhotep one after the other trying to slow his 
 progress an islamic sword and crescent moon necklace a 
 hindu brahma medallion a small buddhist bodhisattva statue 
 all while blessing himself in arabic hindi chinese and 
 latin nothing works skeletal hand reaches for 
 throat tears run down cheeks so freaked 
 and when he holds up the star of david and blesses 
 himself in hebrew imhotep stops in his tracks his hand 
 lowers his grotesque new eyeballs stare at beni 
 imhotep subtitled 
 
 the language of the slaves 
 
 looks at him quizzically imhotep takes a step back 
 imhotep in hebrew subtitled 
 i may have use for you and 
 the rewards will be great 
 imhotep reaches into his tattered robe and then holds out 
 his fetid hand filled with squirming maggots beni cringes 
 about to throw up but then the maggots part revealing a 
 tiny pile of little jewels eyes widen imhotep raises 
 his other hand it holds broken canopic jar 
 imhotep subtitled 
 where are the other sacred jars 
 ext crevice night 
 several mumia drag burns up he stares out with vacant 
 sockets daniels and henderson are especially horrified 
 daniels 
 you bastards 
 henderson 
 what did you do to him 
 ardeth bay 
 we saved him saved him before 
 the creature could finish his work 
 now leave all of you quickly 
 before he finishes you all 
 jonathan 
 not going to kill us 
 evelyn elbows jonathan in the ribs 
 ardeth bay 
 we must now hunt him down and 
 try and find a way to kill him 
 before he consumes the earth 
 allah be with us 
 ardeth bay and the mumia start heading down into the crevice 
 yells at them trying to convince himself 
 
 i told ya i already got him 
 ardeth bay stops and looks back deadly serious 
 ardeth bay 
 know this the creature will be 
 coming for you he must consummate 
 the curse and until he does he 
 will never eat he will never sleep 
 and he will never stop 
 ardeth bay turns and jumps down into the crevice

 joe goes through his front door seeing princess ann still asleep in his bed he shuts the door quietly fastening the chain across also joe stands looking at her for a moment then moves round to the other side of the side she is facing lying down he stands above her looking at her face then looking again at the newspaper picture to compare them he sits down beside her and moves a lock of her out of the way to get a better view of her face he holds the picture up beside her but her hand still partially covers her face he tickles her hand and she moves it restlessly he leans closer to her 
 
 joe 
 quietly

 she stirs with a 
 your 
 royal 
 highness 
 
 ann 
 turning to her other side sighing 
 yes what is it 
 joe sits up in delight the fact of her identity passing through his mind he stands up excitedly putting the newspaper back in his pocket and walks around the bed seeing the alarm clock on the cupboard missing he picks it up from the bed and replaces it he replaces the pillow in its proper place smoothing out the sheets then walks back around to princess ann he carefully picks up her left arm putting it around his neck then slides his arms under her head and legs and carries to the other side of the bed he is about to put her down but sees that she is holding her the wrong way all of a sudden he hears police sirens sound outside and stops for a moment then still holding her picks up the pillow with one hand and puts it at the other end of the bed laying her down gently she continues sleeping as he goes over to the window and looks down at the street at some police cars coming into view around a corner looking back anxiously at the princess he goes back in

 the sounding of the call 
 
 
 when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country many men had sought it few had found it and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery no one knew of the first man the oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him from the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland 
 but no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead wherefore john thornton and pete and hans with buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed they sledded seventy miles up the yukon swung to the left into the stewart river passed the mayo and the mcquestion and held on until the stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent 
 
 john thornton asked little of man or nature he was unafraid of the wild with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased being in no haste indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the traveling and if he failed to find it like the indian he kept on traveling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it so on this great journey into the east straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the timecard was drawn upon the limitless future 
 to buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting summer arrived and dogs and men packs on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest 
 the months came and went and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true they went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wild fowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches 
 and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before once they came upon a path blazed throughout the forest an ancient path and the lost cabin seemed very near but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and remained a mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained a mystery another time they chanced upon the wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a flintlock he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days in the northwest when such a gun was worth its weight in beaver skins packed flat and that was hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets 
 spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the lost cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing pan they sought no farther each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets and they worked every day the gold was sacked in moosehide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the lodge like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up 
 there was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling of meat now and again that thornton killed and buck spent long hours musing by the fire the vision of the hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done and often blinking by the fire buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered 
 the salient thing of this other world seemed fear when he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire did they walk by the beach of a sea where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance through the forest they crept noiselessly buck at the hairy heels and they were alert and vigilant the pair of them ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip in fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath the trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept 
 and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest it filled him with a great unrest and strange desires it caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus covered trunks of fallen trees and to all that moved and sounded about him it might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand but he did not know why he did these various things he was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all 
 irresistible impulses seized him he would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched he loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that waking or sleeping at all times for him to come 
 one night he sprang from sleep with a start nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves from the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was distinct and definite as never howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog and he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf 
 he had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence buck stalked into the open body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey but the wolf fled at sight of him he followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake he ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way the wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps 
 buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances the wolf was suspicious and afraid for buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached shoulder watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or buck could not so easily have overtaken him he would run till head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity 
 but in the end pertinacity was rewarded for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him then they became friendly and played about in the nervous way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere he made it clear to buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the somber twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise 
 on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer buck was wildly glad he knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows he had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead 
 they stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping buck remembered john thornton he sat down the wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled it was a mournful howl and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance 
 john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his the general as john thornton characterized it the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly 
 for two days and nights buck never left camp never let thornton out of his sight he followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised 
 he began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams there he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he traveled and traveling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of ferocity and two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverines quarreling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more 
 the became stronger than ever before he was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being it advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed from his st bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight his muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale 
 his cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning his intelligence shepherd intelligence and st bernard intelligence and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life with vigor and virility when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact every part brain and body nerve tissue and fiber was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment to sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with rapidity quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly he saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant in point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous his muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and put forth generously over the world 
 never was there such a dog said john thornton one day as the partners watched buck marching out of camp 
 when he was made the mold was broke said pete 
 py jingo i think so mineself hans affirmed 
 they saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest he no longer marched at once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows he knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike he could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees fish in open pools were not too quick for him nor were beaver mending their dams too wary he killed to eat not from wantonness but he preferred to eat what he killed himself so a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the 
 as the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys buck had already dragged down a stray calf but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull he was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet with the tips his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of buck 
 from the side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered which accounted for his savageness guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd it was no slight task he would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage at such moments he charged buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape but when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd 
 there is a patience of the tireless persistent as life holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage for half a day this continued buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying 
 as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader the winter was hurrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened the life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll 
 as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light he could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go three hundred weight more than half a ton he weighed he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees 
 from then on night and day buck never left his prey never gave it a rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight at such time buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink 
 the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker he took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest at such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things he could feel a new stir in the land as the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence the news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense he heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different that through it strange things were afoot and ranging and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand 
 at last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down for a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and john thornton he broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame 
 as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way the birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution 
 three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling it led straight toward camp and john thornton buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a but the end his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was traveling he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest the bird life had flitted the squirrels were in hiding one only he sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself 
 as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig he was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body 
 a hundred yards farther on buck came upon one of the sled dogs thornton had bought in dawson this dog was thrashing about in a directly on the trail and buck passed around him without stopping from the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a chant bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine at the same instant buck peered out where the lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders a gust of overpowering rage swept over him he did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head 
 the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before it was buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy he sprang at the foremost was the chief of the the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood he did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man there was no withstanding him he plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him in fact so inconceivably rapid were his movements and so closely were the indians tangled together that they shot one another with the arrows and one young hunter hurling a spear at buck in drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond then a panic seized the yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit 
 and truly buck was the fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees it was a fateful day for the yeehats they scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses as for buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise desperate struggle was on the earth and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool by the edge head and fore feet in the water lay skeet faithful to the last the pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained john thornton for buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away 
 all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew john thornton was dead it left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill at times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats he forgot the pain of it and at such times he was aware of a great pride in pride greater than any he had yet experienced he had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang he sniffed the bodies curiously they had died so easily it was harder to kill a husky dog than them they were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs 
 night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day and with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool buck came alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made he stood up listening and scenting from far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory he walked to the center of the open space and listened it was the call the call sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before and as never before he was ready to obey john thornton was dead the last tie was broken man and the claims of man no longer bound him 
 hunting their living meat as the yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded valley into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood and in the center of the clearing stood buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming they were awed so still and large he stood and a pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him like a flash buck struck breaking the neck then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him three others tried it in sharp succession and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders 
 this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pellmell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey marvelous quickness and agility stood him in good stead pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side but to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front 
 and so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited the tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward others stood on their feet watching him and still others were lapping water from the pool one wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day he was whining softly and as buck whined they touched noses 
 then an old wolf gaunt and came forward buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl the others sat down and howled and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents he too sat down and howled this over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in manner the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods the wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus and buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran 
 and here may well end the story of buck the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centering down the chest but more remarkable than this the yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack they are afraid of this ghost dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in the fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters 
 nay the tale grows worse hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf each fall when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter and women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an 
 in the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the yeehats do not know it is a great gloriously coated wolf like and yet unlike all other wolves he crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees here a yellow stream flows from rotted sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mold overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs 
 but he is not always alone when the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack
