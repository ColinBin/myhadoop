 on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a professor of philosophy who had come from charkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergei koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the last article had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychical and physiological phenomena in man and if so where 
 sergei ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation 
 a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion 
 levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him when a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning to himself of life and death which had of late been more and more often in his mind 
 as he listened to his argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about 
 i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovich with his habitual clearness and distinctness of expression and elegance of diction i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from impressions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea 
 yes but they wurst and knaust and pripassov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurst indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence 
 i maintain the contrary began sergei ivanovich 
 but here it seemed again to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor 
 according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried 
 the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergei ivanovich as though to ask one to say to him but sergei ivanovich who had been talking with far less stress and than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said 
 that question we have no right to answer as yet 
 we have not the requisite data confirmed the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripassov directly asserts sensation is based on impression then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions 
 levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go

 when the professor had gone sergei ivanovich turned to his brother 
 delighted that come for how long your farming getting on 
 levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to him and therefore he told him only about the sale of his wheat and money matters 
 levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married and to ask his advice he had indeed firmly resolved to do so but after seeing his brother listening to his conversation with the professor hearing afterward the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters their property had not been divided and levin took charge of both their shares levin felt that he could not for some reason broach to him his intention of marrying he felt that his brother would not look on it as he would have wished him 
 well how is your zemstvo doing asked sergei ivanovich who was greatly interested in zemstvo establishments and attached great importance to them 
 i really know 
 what but surely a member of the board 
 no not a member now resigned answered levin and i no longer attend the sessions 
 what a pity commented sergei ivanovich frowning 
 levin in began to describe what took place at the sessions in his district 
 how it always is sergei ivanovich interrupted him we russians are always like that perhaps our strong point really this faculty of seeing our own shortcomings but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues all i say is give such rights as our zemstvo establishments to any other european people and why the germans or the english would have worked their way to freedom with them while we simply turn them into ridicule 
 but how can it be helped said levin penitently it was my last trial and i did try with all my soul i no good at it 
 not that no good at it said sergei ivanovich it is that you look at it as you should 
 perhaps not levin answered dejectedly 
 oh do you know brother turned up again 
 this brother nikolai was the elder brother of constantin levin and of sergei ivanovich a man who was done for who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune was living in the strangest and lowest company and had quarreled with his brothers 
 what did you say levin cried with horror how do you know 
 procophii saw him in the street 
 here in moscow where is he do you know levin got up from his chair as though on the point of starting off at once 
 sorry i told you said sergei ivanovich shaking his head at his younger excitement i sent to find out where he is living and sent him his i o u to trubin which i paid this is the answer he sent me 
 and sergei ivanovich took a note from under a paperweight and handed it to his brother 
 levin read in the queer familiar handwriting i humbly beg you to leave me in peace the only favor i ask of my gracious brothers nikolai levin 
 levin read it and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite sergei ivanovich 
 there was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so 
 he obviously wants to offend me pursued sergei ivanovich but he cannot offend me and i should have wished with all my heart to assist him but i know impossible to do that 
 yes yes repeated levin i understand and appreciate your attitude to him but i shall go and see him 
 if you want to do but i advise it said sergei ivanovich as regards myself i have no fear of your doing so he will not make you quarrel with me but for your own sake i should say you would do better not to go you do him any good still do as you please 
 very likely i do any good but i feel especially at such a moment but another thing i feel i could not be at peace 
 well something i understand said sergei ivanovich one thing i do understand he added a lesson in humility i have come to look very differently and more indulgently on what is called infamy since brother nikolai has become what he is you know what he did 
 oh awful awful repeated levin 
 after obtaining his address from sergei footman levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening the thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to moscow for from his levin went to office and on getting news of the shcherbatskys from him he drove to the place where he had been told he might find kitty

 at four conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sleigh at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the carriage at the entrance 
 it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sleighs drivers and gendarmes were standing in the approach crowds of people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments 
 he walked along the path toward the skating ground and kept saying to himself you be excited you must be calm the matter with you what do you want be still foolish one he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went toward the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before him and at once amid all the skaters he recognized her 
 he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all around her is it possible i can go over there on the ice approach her he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might have come there to skate he descended for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun yet seeing her as one does the sun without looking 
 on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were skillful skaters there showing off their skill and beginners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect skated toward her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather 
 nikolai shcherbatsky cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a bench with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him 
 ah the first skater in russia been here long ice do put your skates on 
 i got my skates levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots she with obvious timidity skated toward him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bending down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking toward levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she got a start with one foot and skated straight up to shcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded with a smile to levin she was more beautiful than he had imagined her 
 when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and kindness her childish countenance together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up that special charm of hers which he appreciated so well but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt moved and tender as he remembered himself during certain rare days of his early childhood 
 have you been here long she said giving him her hand thank you she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff 
 i not long ago yesterday i mean i arrived today answered levin in his emotion not comprehending her question immediately i meant to come and see you he said and then recollecting what his intention was in seeking her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed i know you could skate and skate so well 
 she looked at him attentively as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion 
 your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters she said with her little hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff 
 yes i used to skate with passion once upon a time i wanted to attain perfection 
 you do everything with passion i think she said smiling i should so like to see how you skate do put on skates and skate together 
 skate together can that be possible thought levin gazing at her 
 put them on directly he said 
 and he went off to get skates 
 a long while since seen you here sir said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate except you none of the gentlemen skaters will that be all right said he tightening the strap 
 oh yes yes make haste please answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face yes he thought this is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but just why afraid to speak because happy now happy even though only in hope and then but i must i must i must away faintheartedness 
 levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and gaining speed over the rough ice round the pavilion came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached her with timidity but again her smile reassured him 
 she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand 
 with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you she said to him 
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me he said but was at once frightened at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words than all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its tenderness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted mental concentration a tiny wrinkle came upon her smooth brow 
 is there anything troubling you however no right to ask such a question he said hurriedly 
 oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me she responded coldly and immediately added you seen mlle linon have you 
 not yet 
 go and speak to her she likes you so much 
 wrong i have offended her lord help me thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend 
 yes you see growing up she said to him glancing toward kitty and growing old tiny bear has grown big now pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale do you remember what you used to call them 
 he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it 
 now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely she 
 when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness but levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life 
 surely you must feel dull in the country in the winter she said 
 no not dull i am very busy he said feeling that she was making him submit to her composed tone which he would not have the strength to break through just as had been the case at the beginning of the winter 
 are you going to stay in town long kitty questioned him 
 i know he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything and he resolved to mutiny against it 
 how is it you know 
 i know it depends upon you he said and was immediately at his own words 
 whether it was that she did not hear his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went toward the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates 
 my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing concentric and eccentric circles 
 at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse on his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps on his skates crashing and leaping he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice 
 ah a new trick said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to perform this new trick 
 break your neck this needs practice nikolai shcherbatsky shouted after him 
 levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing 
 what a fine darling chap he is kitty was thinking at that moment as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked toward him with a smile of quiet kindness as though he were a favorite brother and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of coquetry i know not he that i love but still i am happy with him and so nice only why did he say that she mused 
 catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens 
 delighted to see you said princess shcherbatskaia on thursdays we are home as always 
 today then 
 we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly 
 this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her coldness she turned her head and with a smile said 
 till this evening 
 at that moment stepan arkadyevich his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a buoyant conqueror but as he approached his he responded to her inquiries about health with a mournful and guilty countenance after a little subdued and dejected conversation with her he set straight his chest again and took levin by the arm 
 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner 
 you like turbot you he said to levin as they were arriving 
 eh responded levin turbot yes awfully fond of turbot

 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner 
 you like turbot you he said to levin as they were arriving 
 eh responded levin turbot yes awfully fond of turbot

 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevich oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats and with napkins under their arms bowing right and left to acquaintances who here as everywhere greeted him joyously he went up to the bar took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the desk something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes 
 this way your excellency please your excellency be disturbed here said a particularly pertinacious old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind walk in your excellency he said to levin being attentive to his guest as well by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevich 
 instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze sconce though it already had a tablecloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands 
 if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golitsin with a lady fresh oysters have come in 
 ah oysters stepan arkadyevich became thoughtful 
 how if we were to change our program levin he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation are the oysters good mind now 
 flensburg your excellency no ostend 
 flensburg will do but are they fresh 
 only arrived yesterday 
 well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh 
 all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course nothing like that here 
 porridge la russe your honor would like said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child 
 no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good been skating and hungry and imagine he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on face that i appreciate your choice i object to a good dinner 
 i should hope so after all one of the pleasures of life said stepan arkadyevich well then my friend you give us two or better say three dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables 
 printaniere prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevich apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes 
 with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then roast beef and mind good yes and capons perhaps and then stewed fruit 
 the tatar recollecting that it was stepan way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill soupe printaniere turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard macdoine de fruits and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevich 
 what shall we drink 
 what you like only not too much champagne said levin 
 what to start with right though i dare say do you like the white seal 
 cachet blanc prompted the tatar 
 very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then see 
 yes sir and what table wine 
 you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis 
 yes sir and your cheese your excellency 
 oh yes parmesan or would you like another 
 no all the same to me said levin unable to suppress a smile 
 and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells and a bottle between his fingers 
 stepan arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters 
 not bad he said detaching the jellied oysters from their pearly shells with a small silver fork and swallowing them one after another not bad he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes now upon levin now upon the tatar 
 levin ate the oysters too though white bread and cheese pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses and adjusting his white cravat kept on glancing at stepan arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction 
 you care much for oysters do you said stepan arkadyevich emptying his wineglass or are you worried about something eh 
 he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes looking glasses gas and tatars all of this was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of 
 i yes i am worried but besides that all this bothers me he said you conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman like me as queer as that nails i saw at your office 
 yes i saw how much interested you were in poor nails said stepan arkadyevich laughing 
 too much for me responded levin do try now to put yourself in my place take the point of view of a countryman we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we tuck up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as possible and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled gaily 
 oh yes just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind 
 maybe but still queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves as soon as we can so as to be ready for work while here are we trying to delay satiety as long as possible and with that object are eating oysters 
 why of course objected stepan arkadyevich but just the aim of culture to make everything a source of enjoyment 
 well if its aim rather be a savage 
 you are a savage as it is all you levins are savages 
 levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolai and felt ashamed and pained and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention 
 oh i say are you going tonight to our people the i mean he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese toward him 
 yes i shall certainly go replied levin though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation 
 what nonsense her manner come boy the soup her manner grande dame said stepan arkadyevich coming too but i have to go to the countess rehearsal come it true that a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does 
 yes said levin slowly and with emotion right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come 
 oh what a lucky fellow you are broke in stepan arkadyevich looking into eyes 
 why 
 i can tell the gallant steeds by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich everything is before you 
 why is it over for you already 
 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar 
 are you trying to surmise responded levin his eyes gleaming in their depth fixed on stepan arkadyevich 
 i am but i be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i surmise right or wrong said stepan arkadyevich gazing at levin with a subtle smile 
 well and what have you to say to me said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too how do you look at it 
 stepan arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin 
 i said stepan arkadyevich nothing i desire so much as that nothing it would be the best thing that could happen 
 but not making a mistake you know what speaking of said levin piercing him with his eyes you think possible 
 i think possible why not 
 no do you really think possible no tell me all you think oh but if if in store for me indeed i feel sure 
 what makes you think so said stepan arkadyevich smiling at his excitement 
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too 
 oh well anyway nothing awful in it for a girl every proud of a proposal 
 yes every girl but not she 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he so well knew that feeling of that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human failings and very ordinary girls the other class she alone having no failings of any sort and higher than all humanity 
 stay take some sauce he said holding back hand who was pushing the sauce away 
 levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevich go on with his dinner 
 no stop a minute stop a minute he said you must understand that a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and no one to whom i could speak of it except yourself you know utterly unlike each other different in tastes and views and everything but i know fond of me and understand me and why i like you awfully but for sake be quite straightforward with me 
 i tell you what i think said stepan arkadyevich smiling but say more my wife is a wonderful woman stepan arkadyevich sighed recalling his relations with his wife and after a silence resumed she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaia would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and on your side 
 how do you mean 
 not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife 
 at these words face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from touching tears 
 she says that cried out levin i always said she was charming your wife there enough said about it he said getting up from his seat 
 well but do sit down 
 but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table 
 you must understand said he not love been in love but not that not my feeling but a sort of force outside me that has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand like a happiness which is not of this earth but struggled with myself and i see no living without it and it must be settled 
 what did you go away for 
 ah stop a minute ah the thoughts that come crowding on one the questions one must ask oneself listen you imagine what done for me by what you said so happy that become positively hateful forgotten everything i heard today that my brother nikolai you know here i had forgotten even him it seems to me that happy too a sort of madness but one awful here been married you know the feeling awful that we fully mature with a past a past not of love but of sins are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent loathsome and why one help feeling oneself unworthy 
 oh well you many sins on your conscience 
 ah still said levin when with loathing i go my life i shudder and i curse and bitterly regret yes 
 what would you have the way of the world said stepan arkadyevich 
 one comfort like that of the prayer which i always liked forgive me not according to my deeds but according to thy the only way she can forgive me

 levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while 
 one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky stepan arkadyevich asked levin 
 no i why do you ask 
 give us another bottle stepan arkadyevich directed the tatar who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was least wanted 
 why you ought to know vronsky because one of your rivals 
 vronsky said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression 
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovich vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of peterburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an and with all that a very fine fellow but more than simply a fellow as found out here a cultured man too and very intelligent a man make his mark 
 levin scowled and kept silent 
 well he turned up here soon after gone and as i can see over head and ears in love with kitty and you know that her mother 
 excuse me but i know nothing said levin frowning gloomily and immediately he recalled his brother nikolai and how vile he was to have been able to forget him 
 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 the young princess kitty shcherbatskaia was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already the first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky 
 appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and there were some other reasons too but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter that levin was not to her liking and that she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly you see i was right when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match 
 in the eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin the mother disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded on his pride as she supposed and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making a proposal and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared as well not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him thought the mother 
 vronsky satisfied all the desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for 
 vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation 
 princess shcherbatskaia had herself been married thirty years ago her aunt arranging the match the wooer about whom everything was well known beforehand had come looked at his intended and been looked at the matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression that impression had been favorable afterward on a day fixed beforehand the expected proposal was made to her parents and accepted all had passed very simply and easily so it seemed at least to the princess but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business apparently so commonplace of marrying off daughters the panics that had been lived through the thoughts that had been brooded over the money that had been wasted and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls darya and natalya now since the youngest began to come out in the world the princess was going through the same terrors the same doubts and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls the old prince like all fathers indeed was exceedingly scrupulous on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters he was unreasonably jealous over his daughters especially over kitty who was his favorite and at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters but now she felt that there was more ground for the scrupulousness she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society that a duties had become still more difficult she saw that girls of age formed some sort of clubs went to some sort of lectures mixed freely in society drove about the streets alone many of them did not curtsy and what was the most important thing all of them were firmly convinced that to choose their husband was their own affair and not their marriages made nowadays as they used to be was thought and said by all these young girls and even by their elders but just how marriages were made nowadays the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion of the parents arranging their future was not accepted it was condemned the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking was considered unseemly it was ridiculed by everyone even by the princess herself but how girls were to be married and how parents were to marry them no one knew everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing mercy on us high time in our day to cast off all that business the young people have to marry and not their parents and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose it was very easy for anyone to say who had no daughters but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband and however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves she was unable to believe it just as she would have been unable to believe that at any time whatever loaded pistols were the most suitable playthings for children five years old and so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over the elder daughters 
 now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she knew how easy it is with the freedom of manners of today to turn a head and how lightly men generally regard such a crime the week before kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation had partly reassured the princess yet her assurance could not be perfect vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her and just now i am impatiently awaiting my coming from peterburg as a peculiar piece of luck he had told her 
 kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest fate engrossed all her feelings today with reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from an extreme sense of honesty refuse vronsky and that arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair now so near conclusion 
 why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home 
 he came today maman 
 one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be 
 mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please say anything about that i know i know all about it 
 she wished what her mother wished for but the motives of her wishes hurt her 
 i only want to say that to raise hopes 
 mamma darling for sake talk about it so horrible to talk about it 
 i said her mother seeing the tears in her eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you 
 never mamma none answered kitty flushing and looking her mother straight in the face but i have nothing to tell you now and i i if i wanted to i know what to say or how i know 
 no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything that was taking place just now in her soul

 after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty was experiencing a sensation akin to that of a young man before a battle her heart throbbed violently and her thoughts would not rest on anything 
 she felt that this evening when both these men would meet for the first time would be a turning point in her life and she was continually picturing them to herself at one moment each individually and then both together when she mused on the past she dwelt with pleasure with tenderness on the memories of her relations with levin the memories of childhood and of friendship with her dead brother have a special poetic charm to her relations with him his love for her of which she felt certain was flattering and delightful to her and it was easy for her to think of levin in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness though he was in the highest degree a fashionable and man as though there were some false note not in vronsky he was very simple and charming but in herself while with levin she felt herself perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she thought of the future with vronsky there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seemed misty 
 when she went upstairs to dress and looked into the looking glass she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days and that she was in complete possession of all her forces she needed this so for what lay before her she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements 
 at seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room when the footman announced constantin dmitrievich levin the princess was still in her room and the prince had not come in so it is to be thought kitty and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart she was horrified at her paleness as she glanced into the looking glass 
 at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to propose to her and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new different aspect only then she realized that the question did not affect her only with whom she would be happy and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked and to wound him cruelly wherefore because he dear fellow loved her was in love with her but there was no help for it it must be so it would have to be so 
 my god shall i myself really have to say it to him she thought can i tell him i love him that will be a lie what am i to say to him that i love someone else no impossible going away going away 
 she had reached the door when she heard his step no not honest what have i to be afraid of i have done nothing wrong what is to be will be tell the truth and with him one be ill at ease here he is she said to herself seeing his powerful and timid figure with his shining eyes fixed on her she looked straight into his face as though imploring him to spare her and gave him her hand 
 not time yet i think too early he said glancing round the empty drawing room when he saw that his expectations were realized that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking his face became somber 
 oh no said kitty and sat down at a table 
 but this was just what i wanted to find you alone he began without sitting down and not looking at her so as not to lose courage 
 mamma will be down directly she was very much tired yesterday yesterday 
 she talked on not knowing what her lips were uttering and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him 
 he glanced at her she blushed and ceased speaking 
 i told you i did not know whether i should be here long that it depended on you 
 she dropped her head lower and lower not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming 
 that it depended on you he repeated i meant to say i meant to say i came for this to have you be my wife he blurted out not knowing what he was saying but feeling that the most terrible thing was said he stopped short and looked at her 
 she was breathing heavily without looking at him she was feeling ecstasy her soul was flooded with happiness she had never anticipated that his utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her but it lasted only an instant she remembered vronsky she lifted her clear truthful eyes and seeing desperate face she answered hastily 
 that cannot be forgive me 
 a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what importance in his life and how aloof and remote from him she had become now 
 it could not have been otherwise he said without looking at her he bowed and was about to leave

 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he 
 now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved 
 there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people who on the contrary desire above all to find in that successful rival the qualities by which he has worsted them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face everything about his face and figure from his black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty 
 as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with an especially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her 
 greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him 
 let me introduce you said the princess indicating levin constantin dmitrievich levin count alexei kirillovich vronsky 
 vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him 
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter he said smiling his simple and open smile but you had unexpectedly left for the country 
 constantin dmitrievich despises and hates the town and us townspeople said countess nordstone 
 my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well said levin and suddenly becoming conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened 
 vronsky looked at levin and countess nordstone and smiled 
 are you always in the country he inquired i should think it must be dull in the winter 
 not dull if one has work to do besides not dull by oneself levin replied abruptly 
 i am fond of the country said vronsky noticing yet affecting not to notice tone 
 but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always said countess nordstone 
 i know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once he went on i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and just there that russia comes back to mind most vividly and especially the country as though 
 he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head 
 noticing that countess nordstone wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her 
 the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the old princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns the classical and professional education and universal military service had not to move out either of them while countess nordstone had no chance of chaffing levin 
 levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant now go he still did not go as though waiting for something 
 the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits and countess nordstone who believed in spiritualism began to describe the miracles she had seen 
 ah countess you really must take me for sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere said vronsky smiling 
 very well next saturday answered countess nordstone but you constantin dmitrievich are you a believer she asked levin 
 why do you ask me you know what i shall say 
 but i want to hear your opinion 
 my opinion answered levin is merely that this table turning proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and conjurations while we 
 oh then you a believer 
 i believe countess 
 but if seen for myself 
 the peasant women too tell us they have seen hobgoblins 
 then you think i tell a lie 
 and she laughed a mirthless laugh 
 oh no masha constantin dmitrievich merely said he could not believe said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable 
 you do not admit the possibility at all he queried but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which 
 when electricity was discovered levin interrupted hurriedly it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists on the contrary have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force 
 vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words 
 yes but the spiritualists say we know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists of no i see why there should not be a new force if it 
 why because with electricity levin interrupted again every time you rub tar against wool a certain phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon 
 feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies 
 do let us try at once countess he said but levin would finish saying what he thought 
 i think he went on that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment 
 everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt this 
 why i think you would be a medium said countess nordstone something enthusiastic about you 
 levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing 
 do let us try table turning at once please said vronsky princess will you allow it 
 and vronsky stood up looking about for a little table 
 kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the cause if you can forgive me forgive me said her eyes i am so happy 
 i hate them all and you and myself his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin 
 ah he began joyously been here long my boy i even know you were in town very glad to see you the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was calmly waiting till the prince should turn to him 
 kitty felt how grievous her cordiality was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him and she flushed 
 prince let us have constantin dmitrievich said countess nordstone we want to try an experiment 
 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball

 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he

 at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with levin and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin she was glad at the thought that she had received a proposal she had no doubt that she had acted rightly but after she had gone to bed she could not sleep for a long while one impression pursued her relentlessly it was face with his scowling brows and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them as he stood listening to her father and glancing at her and at vronsky and she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes but immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up she vividly recalled his manly firm face his noble calmness and the good nature so conspicuous toward everyone she remembered the love for her of the man she loved and once more all was gladness in her soul and she lay on the pillow smiling with happiness sorry sorry but what could i do not my fault she said to herself but an inner voice told her otherwise whether she felt remorse at having captivated levin or at having refused him she did not know but her happiness was poisoned by doubts lord have pity on us lord have pity lord have pity she said over to herself till she fell asleep 
 meanwhile there took place below in the little study one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter 
 what tell you what shouted the prince brandishing his arms and at once wrapping his dressing gown round him again that no pride no dignity that disgracing ruining your daughter by this vulgar stupid matchmaking 
 but really for sake prince what have i done said the princess almost crying 
 she pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter had gone to the prince to say good night as usual and though she had no intention of telling him of proposal and refusal still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with vronsky and would be definitely so as soon as his mother arrived and thereupon at those words the prince had all at once flown into a passion and begun to use unseemly language 
 what have you done tell you what first of all trying to allure an eligible gentleman and all moscow will be talking of it and with good reason if you have evening parties invite everyone pick out the possible suitors invite all these whelps so the prince styled the youths of moscow engage a piano player and let them dance and not as you did tonight only the wooers and doing your matching it makes me sick sick to see it and gone on till turned the poor head a thousand times the better man as for this peterburg swell turned out by machinery all on one pattern and all precious rubbish but if he were a prince of the blood my daughter need not run after anyone 
 but what have i done 
 why the prince was yelling wrathfully 
 i know if one were to listen to you interrupted the princess we should never marry off our daughter if to be so better go into the country 
 well we had better 
 but do wait a minute do i wheedle them i wheedle them in the least a young man and a very nice one has fallen in love with her and she i fancy 
 oh yes you fancy and how if she really is in love and no more thinking of marriage than i am oh that i should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball and the prince imagining that he was mimicking his wife made a mincing curtsy at each word and this is how we prepare wretchedness for katenka and really got the notion into her head 
 but what makes you suppose so 
 i suppose i know for such things we have eyes womenfolk i see a man who has serious intentions levin and i see a quail like this cackler only amusing himself 
 oh well when once you get an idea into your head 
 well remember my words but too late just as with dashenka 
 well well we talk of it the princess stopped him recollecting her unlucky dolly 
 by all means and good night 
 and signing each other with the cross the husband and wife parted with a kiss feeling that each remained of his or her own opinion 
 the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled fortune and that there could be no doubt of intentions but her words had disturbed her and returning to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeated several times in her heart lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity

 vronsky had never had a real home life his mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman who had had during her married life and still more afterward many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remembered and he had been educated in the corps of pages 
 leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer he had at once got into the circle of wealthy peterburg army men although he did go more or less into peterburg society his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it 
 in moscow he had for the first time felt after his luxurious and coarse life at peterburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who cared for him it never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty at balls he danced principally with her he was a constant visitor at her house he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all sorts of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him and the more he felt this the better he liked it and the tenderer was his feeling for her he did not know that this mode of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was it seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure and he was enjoying his discovery 
 if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her he would have been greatly astonished and would not have believed it he could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him and above all to her could be wrong still less could he have believed that he ought to marry 
 marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility he not only disliked family life but a family and especially a husband in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived were conceived as something alien repellent and above all ridiculous but though vronsky had not the least suspicion of what the parents were saying he felt on coming away from the that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken but what step could and should be taken he could not imagine 
 what is so exquisite he thought as he returned from the carrying away with him as he always did a delicious feeling of purity and freshness arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her yet we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me and how sweetly simply and most of all how trustfully i feel myself better purer i feel that i have a heart and that there is a great deal of good in me those sweet loving eyes when she said indeed i do 
 well what then oh nothing good for me and good for her and he began wondering where to finish the evening 
 he passed in review the places he might go to club a game of bezique champagne with ignatov no not going chateau des fleurs there i shall find oblonsky songs the cancan no sick of it why i like the because growing better go home he went straight to his room at hotel ordered supper and then undressed and as soon as his head touched the pillow fell into a sound sleep

 well what then oh nothing good for me and good for her and he began wondering where to finish the evening 
 he passed in review the places he might go to club a game of bezique champagne with ignatov no not going chateau des fleurs there i shall find oblonsky songs the cancan no sick of it why i like the because growing better go home he went straight to his room at hotel ordered supper and then undressed and as soon as his head touched the pillow fell into a sound sleep

 next day at eleven in the morning vronsky drove to the station of the peterburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was oblonsky who was expecting his sister by the same train 
 ah your excellency cried oblonsky whom are you meeting 
 my mother vronsky responded smiling as everyone did who met oblonsky he shook hands with him and together they ascended the steps she is to be here from peterburg today 
 i was looking out for you till two last night where did you go from the 
 home answered vronsky i must own i felt so well content yesterday after the that i care to go anywhere 
 i can tell the gallant by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich just as he had done before to levin 
 vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it but he promptly changed the subject 
 and whom are you meeting he asked 
 i come to meet a pretty woman said oblonsky 
 so it 
 honi soit qui mal y pense my sister anna 
 ah madame karenina said vronsky 
 you know her no doubt 
 i think i do or perhaps not i really am not sure vronsky answered heedlessly with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name karenina 
 but alexei alexandrovich my celebrated you surely must know all the world knows him 
 i know him by reputation and by sight i know that clever learned religious somewhat but you know not not in my line said vronsky in english 
 yes a very remarkable man rather a conservative but a very nice man observed stepan arkadyevich a very nice man 
 oh well so much the better for him said vronsky smiling oh come he said addressing a tall old footman of his standing at the door come here 
 besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with kitty 
 well what do you say shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva he said to him with a smile taking his arm 
 of course collecting subscriptions oh did you make the acquaintance of my friend levin asked stepan arkadyevich 
 yes but he left rather early 
 a capital fellow pursued oblonsky he 
 i know why it is responded vronsky in all moscow people present company of course excepted he put in jestingly something uncompromising they are all on the defensive lose their tempers as though they all want to make one feel something 
 yes true so said stepan arkadyevich laughing cheerfully 
 will the train be in soon vronsky asked a railway official 
 the signaled answered the man 
 the approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station the rush of porters the movement of gendarmes and attendants and crowding people meeting the train through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line the hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails and the rumble of something heavy 
 no said stepan arkadyevich who felt a great inclination to tell vronsky of intentions in regard to kitty no you got a true impression of levin a very nervous man and is sometimes out of humor true but then he is often very charming he has such a true honest nature and a heart of gold but yesterday there were special reasons pursued stepan arkadyevich with a meaning smile totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend and feeling the same sympathy now only for vronsky yes there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy 
 vronsky stood still and asked directly how so do you mean he proposed to your yesterday 
 maybe said stepan arkadyevich i fancied something of the sort yesterday yes if he went away early and was out of humor too such must be the case been so long in love and very sorry for him 
 so it i should imagine though she might reckon on a better match said vronsky setting his chest straight and walking about again though i know him of course he added yes that is a hateful position why most fellows prefer to have to do with the claras if you succeed with them it only proves that not enough cash but in this case dignity is in the balance but the train 
 the engine had already whistled in the distance a few instants later the platform began to shake and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost the engine rolled up with the rod of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down and the bowed muffled figure of the engine driver covered with hoarfrost behind the tender setting the platform more and more slowly and more powerfully shaking came the luggage van with a dog whining in it at last the passenger carriages rolled in quivering before coming to a standstill 
 a smart guard jumped out giving a whistle and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down an officer of the guards holding himself erect and looking severely about him a nimble young merchant with a bag smiling gaily a peasant with a sack over his shoulder 
 vronsky standing beside oblonsky watched the carriages and the passengers totally oblivious of his mother what he had just heard about kitty excited and delighted him unconsciously he straightened his chest and his eyes flashed he felt himself a conqueror 
 countess vronskaia is in that compartment said the smart guard going up to vronsky 
 the words roused him and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her he did not in his heart respect his mother and without acknowledging it to himself he did not love her though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived and with his own upbringing he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient and the more externally obedient and respectful the less in his heart he respected and loved her

 chapter 
 
 vronsky followed the guard to the carriage and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out 
 with the habitual feeling of a man of the world from one glance at this appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society he begged pardon and was getting into the carriage but felt he must glance at her once more not because she was very beautiful not because of that elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure but because in the expression of her charming face as she passed close by him there was something peculiarly caressing and soft as he looked round she too turned her head her shining gray eyes that looked dark because of her thick lashes rested with friendly attention on his face as though she were recognizing him and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd as though seeking someone in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation which played over her face and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips it was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes and now in her smile deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile 
 vronsky stepped into the carriage his mother a old lady with black eyes and ringlets screwed up her eyes scanning her son and smiled slightly with her thin lips getting up from the seat and handing her maid a handbag she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss and lifting his head from her hand kissed him on the cheek 
 you got my telegram quite well thank god 
 you had a good journey said her son sitting down beside her and involuntarily listening to a voice outside the door he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door 
 all the same i agree with you said the voice 
 the peterburg view madame 
 not peterburg but simply feminine she responded 
 well well allow me to kiss your hand 
 ivan petrovich and would you see if my brother is here and send him to me said the lady in the doorway and stepped back again into the compartment 
 well have you found your brother said countess vronskaia addressing the lady 
 vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina 
 your brother is here he said standing up excuse me i did not know you and indeed our acquaintance was so slight said vronsky bowing that no doubt you do not remember me 
 oh no said she i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking i think of nothing but you all the way as she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile and still no sign of my brother 
 do call him aliosha said the old countess 
 vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted oblonsky here 
 madame karenina however did not wait for her brother but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light resolute step and as soon as her brother had reached her with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace she flung her left arm around his neck drew him rapidly to her and kissed him warmly vronsky looked on never taking his eyes from her and smiled he could not have said why but recollecting that his mother was waiting for him he went back again into the carriage 
 
 very sweet she said the countess of madame karenina her husband put her with me and i was delighted to have her been talking all the way and so you i hear vous filez le parfait amour tant mieux mon cher tant mieux 
 i know what you are referring to maman he answered coldly come maman let us go 
 madame karenina entered the carriage again to say to the countess 
 well countess you have met your son and i my brother she said gaily and all my stories are exhausted i should have nothing more to tell you 
 oh no said the countess taking her hand i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company sweet either to be silent or to chat now please fret over your son you expect never to be parted 
 madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling 
 anna arkadyevna the countess said in explanation to her son has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him 
 yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him 
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess 
 thank you so much the time has passed so quickly countess 
 my love answered the countess let me kiss your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that lost my heart to you 
 stereotyped as the phrase was madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it she flushed bent down slightly and put her cheek to the lips drew herself up again and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes she gave her hand to vronsky he pressed the little hand she gave him and was delighted as though at something special by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness 
 very charming said the countess 
 that was precisely what her son was thinking his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight and then the smile remained on his face he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother put her arm in his and began telling him something animatedly obviously something that had nothing to do with him vronsky and at that he felt annoyed 
 well maman are you perfectly well he repeated turning to his mother 
 everything has been delightful alexandre has been very good and marie has grown very pretty very interesting 
 and she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson for which she had been staying in peterburg and the special favor shown her elder son by the czar 
 lavrentii said vronsky looking out of the window now we can go if you like 
 the old butler who had traveled with the countess came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready and the countess got up to go 
 come not such a crowd now said vronsky 
 the maid took a handbag and the lap dog the butler and a porter the other baggage vronsky gave his mother his arm but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with faces the stationmaster too ran by in his extraordinarily colored cap obviously something unusual had happened the crowd was running to the tail end of the train 
 what what where flung himself crushed was heard among the crowd 
 stepan arkadyevich with his sister on his arm turned back they too looked scared and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd 
 the ladies got in while vronsky and stepan arkadyevich followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster 
 a watchman either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost had not heard the train moving back and had been crushed 
 before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler 
 oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse oblonsky was evidently distressed he frowned and seemed ready to cry 
 ah how awful ah anna if you had seen it ah how awful he kept repeating 
 vronsky did not speak his handsome face was serious but perfectly calm 
 ah if you had seen it countess said stepan arkadyevich and his wife was there it was awful to see her she flung herself on the body they say he was the only support of an immense family how awful 
 one do anything for her said madame karenina in an agitated whisper 
 vronsky glanced at her and immediately got out of the carriage 
 be back directly maman he remarked turning round in the doorway 
 when he came back a few minutes later stepan arkadyevich was already in conversation with the countess about a new singer while she was impatiently looking toward the door waiting for her son 
 now let us be off said vronsky coming in 
 they went out together vronsky was in front with his mother behind walked madame karenina with her brother just as they were going out of the station the stationmaster overtook vronsky 
 you gave my assistant two hundred roubles would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them 
 for the widow said vronsky shrugging his shoulders i should have thought there was no need to ask 
 you gave that cried oblonsky behind and pressing his hand he added most charming most charming he a fine fellow countess 
 and he and his sister stood still looking for her maid 
 when they went out the carriage had already driven away people coming in were still talking of what had happened 
 what a horrible death said a gentleman passing by they say he was cut in two 
 on the contrary i think the easiest instantaneous observed another 
 how is it they take proper precautions a third was saying 
 madame karenina seated herself in the carriage and stepan arkadyevich saw with surprise that her lips were quivering and that she was with difficulty restraining her tears 
 what is it anna he asked when they had driven a few hundred sagenes 
 an omen of evil she said 
 what nonsense said stepan arkadyevich come the chief thing you conceive how resting my hopes on you 
 have you known vronsky long she asked 
 yes you know hoping he will marry kitty 
 yes said anna softly come now let us talk of you she added tossing her head as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her let us talk of your affairs i got your letter and here i am 
 yes all my hopes are in you said stepan arkadyevich 
 well tell me all about it 
 and stepan arkadyevich began his story 
 on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out sighed pressed her hand and set off to his office

 chapter 
 
 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you

 is this grisha heavens how grown said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed no please let us stay here 
 she took off her shawl and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down 
 you are radiant with health and happiness said dolly almost with envy 
 i yes said anna merciful heavens tania the same age as my seriozha she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her delightful child delightful show me them all 
 she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that

 after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawing room to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her 
 dolly she said he has told me 
 dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases but anna said nothing of the sort 
 dolly darling she said i want to intercede for him nor to try to comfort you impossible but my dearest simply sorry sorry from my heart for you 
 under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her and took her hand in her own vigorous and little dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said 
 to comfort me is impossible lost after what has happened over 
 and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said 
 but dolly to be done to be done how is it best to act in this awful position what you must think of 
 over and nothing more said dolly and the worst of it all is you see that i cast him off there are the children my hands are tied and i live with him a torture for me to see him 
 dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me all about it 
 dolly looked at her inquiringly 
 sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on face 
 very well she suddenly said but i will begin at the beginning you know how i was married with the education maman gave us i was more than innocent i was foolish i knew nothing they say i know men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva she corrected herself stepan arkadyevich told me nothing hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was not only far from suspecting infidelity but i regarded it as impossible and then try to imagine it with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of happiness and all at once continued dolly holding back her sobs to get a letter his letter to his mistress a governess in my employ no too awful she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it i can understand if it were passion she went on after a brief silence but to deceive me deliberately slyly and with whom to go on being my husband while he and she awful you understand 
 oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand said anna pressing her hand 
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position dolly resumed not in the slightest happy and contented 
 oh no anna interposed quickly to be pitied weighed down by remorse 
 is he capable of remorse dolly interrupted gazing intently into her face 
 yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him but proud and now so humiliated what touched me most and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most tortured by two things that ashamed for the sake and that loving you yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have rejoined he has hurt you pierced you to the heart no no she cannot forgive me he keeps on saying 
 dolly looked pensively past her as she listened to her words 
 yes i can see that his position is awful worse for the guilty than the innocent she said if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him 
 and sobs cut short her words 
 but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her 
 young you see pretty she went on do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent about me do you understand 
 again her eyes glowed with hatred 
 and after that he will tell me what am i to believe him never no everything is over everything that once constituted my comfort the reward of my work and of my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why to have children so awful is that all at once my turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him and 
 darling dolly i understand but torture yourself you are so insulted so excited that you look at many things mistakenly 
 dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent 
 to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing 
 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did 
 no he understands and understood dolly broke in but i you are forgetting me does that make it easier for me 
 wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the horror of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling while i fully realize your sufferings there is one thing i know i know i know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him 
 no dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more 
 i know more of the world than you do she said i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their own home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that be crossed between them and their families i understand it but it is so 
 yes but he has kissed her 
 dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word a marvelous woman have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been a passion of the heart 
 but if it be repeated 
 it cannot be as i understand it 
 yes but could you forgive it 
 i know i judge no i can judge said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive i could not be the same no but i could forgive and forgive as though it had never been never been at all 
 oh of course dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go take you to your room she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better

 chapter 
 
 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you 
 i am glad too said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of face to find out whether she knew most likely she knows she thought noticing the sympathy in face well come along take you to your room she went on trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation

 the whole of that day anna spent at home that is at the and received no one though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival and came to call the same day anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home come god is merciful she wrote 
 oblonsky did dine at home the conversation was general and his wife speaking to him addressed him as stiva as she had not done for some time past in the relations of husband and wife the same estrangement still remained but there was no talk of separation and stepan arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation 
 immediately after dinner kitty came in she knew anna arkadyevna but only very slightly and she came now to her with some trepidation at the prospect of meeting this fashionable peterburg lady of whom everyone spoke so highly but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna she perceived that at once anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under sway but in love with her as young girls do fall in love with older and married women anna did not resemble a fashionable lady or the mother of a boy eight years old in the elasticity of her movements the freshness and the animation which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty had it not been for a serious and at times a mournful look in her eyes which struck and attracted kitty kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing but that she had another higher world of interests complex and poetic which were inaccessible to kitty 
 after dinner when dolly withdrew to her own room anna rose quickly and went up to her brother who was just lighting a cigar 
 stiva she said to him winking gaily making the sign of the cross over him and glancing toward the door go and god help you 
 he tossed away his cigar having understood her and departed through the doorway 
 when stepan arkadyevich had disappeared she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her the two elder ones and the younger following their lead as children so often do had clung about their new aunt since before dinner and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt to touch her hold her little hand kiss it play with her ring or even touch the flounce of her skirt 
 come come as we were sitting before said anna arkadyevna sitting down in her place 
 and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness 
 and when is your next ball she asked kitty 
 next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself 
 why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself anna said with tender irony 
 strange but there are at the one always enjoys oneself and at the too while at the always dull you noticed it 
 no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her for me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others 
 how can you be dull at a ball 
 why should not i be dull at a ball inquired anna 
 kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow 
 because you always look the loveliest of all 
 anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed and said 
 in the first place never so and secondly if it were what difference would it make to me 
 are you coming to this ball asked kitty 
 i imagine it be possible to avoid going here take it she said to tania who was pulling the loosely fitting ring off her white finger 
 i shall be so glad if you go i should so like to see you at a ball 
 anyway if i do go i shall comfort myself with the thought that a pleasure to you grisha pull my hair untidy enough without that she said putting up a straying lock which grisha had been playing with 
 i imagine you at the ball in lilac 
 and why in lilac precisely asked anna smiling now children run along run along do you hear miss hoole is calling you to tea she said tearing the children from her and sending them off to the dining room 
 i know why you press me to come to the ball you expect a great deal of this ball and you want everyone to be there and take part in it 
 how do you know yes 
 oh what a happy time you are at pursued anna i remember and i know this blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland this mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending and out of that vast circle happy and gay there is a path growing narrower and narrower and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom bright and splendid as it is who has not been through it 
 kitty smiled without speaking but how did she go through it how i should like to know all her love story thought kitty recalling the unromantic appearance of alexei alexandrovich her husband 
 i know something stiva told me and i congratulate you i liked him so much anna continued i met vronsky at the railway station 
 oh was he there asked kitty blushing what was it stiva told you 
 stiva blabbed about it all and i should be so glad i traveled yesterday with mother she went on and his mother talked without a pause of him her favorite i know mothers are partial but 
 what did his mother tell you 
 oh a great deal and although i know that her favorite one can still see how chivalrous he is well for instance she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child saved a woman from the water a hero in fact said anna smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station 
 but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles for some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it she felt that there was something that had to do with her in it and something that ought not to have been 
 she pressed me very much to go and see her anna went on and i shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow stiva is staying a long while in room thank god anna added changing the subject and getting up kitty fancied displeased with something 
 no first no i screamed the children who had finished tea running up to their aunt anna

 dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownups stepan arkadyevich did not come out he must have left his room by a back door 
 i am afraid be cold upstairs observed dolly addressing anna i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer 
 oh please trouble about me answered anna looking intently into face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not 
 it will be lighter for you here answered her 
 i assure you that i can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any time 
 all this inquired stepan arkadyevich coming out of his room and addressing his wife 
 from his tone both kitty and anna at once gathered that a reconciliation had taken place 
 i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself answered dolly addressing him 
 god knows whether they are fully reconciled thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed 
 come dolly why be always making difficulties answered her husband there do it all if you like 
 i know how you do everything answered dolly you tell matvei to do what be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of lips as she spoke 
 full full reconciliation full thought anna thank god and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her 
 not at all why do you always look down on me and matvei said stepan arkadyevich smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife 
 the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevich was happy and cheerful yet not so as to seem as if having been forgiven he had forgotten his fault 
 at nine a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange having begun talking about common acquaintances in peterburg anna got up quickly 
 she is in my album she said and by the way show you my seriozha she added with a smile of pride 
 toward ten when she usually said good night to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her seriozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase 
 just as she was leaving the drawing room a ring was heard in the hall 
 who can that be said dolly 
 too early for me to be fetched and for anyone else too late observed kitty 
 sure to be someone with papers for me put in stepan arkadyevich when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of some dread stirred in her heart he stood there without taking off his coat and pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and the expression of his face changed to embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and calm voice of vronsky refusing 
 when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity 
 and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is added stepan arkadyevich 
 kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up he has been at home she thought and find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and here 
 all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at album 
 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a calling at nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in yet it seemed strange to all of them and to anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than to any of the others

 dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownups stepan arkadyevich did not come out he must have left his room by a back door 
 i am afraid be cold upstairs observed dolly addressing anna i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer 
 oh please trouble about me answered anna looking intently into face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not 
 it will be lighter for you here answered her 
 i assure you that i can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any time 
 all this inquired stepan arkadyevich coming out of his room and addressing his wife 
 from his tone both kitty and anna at once gathered that a reconciliation had taken place 
 i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself answered dolly addressing him 
 god knows whether they are fully reconciled thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed 
 come dolly why be always making difficulties answered her husband there do it all if you like 
 i know how you do everything answered dolly you tell matvei to do what be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of lips as she spoke 
 full full reconciliation full thought anna thank god and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her 
 not at all why do you always look down on me and matvei said stepan arkadyevich smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife 
 the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevich was happy and cheerful yet not so as to seem as if having been forgiven he had forgotten his fault 
 at nine a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange having begun talking about common acquaintances in peterburg anna got up quickly 
 she is in my album she said and by the way show you my seriozha she added with a smile of pride 
 toward ten when she usually said good night to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her seriozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase 
 just as she was leaving the drawing room a ring was heard in the hall 
 who can that be said dolly 
 too early for me to be fetched and for anyone else too late observed kitty 
 sure to be someone with papers for me put in stepan arkadyevich when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of some dread stirred in her heart he stood there without taking off his coat and pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and the expression of his face changed to embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and calm voice of vronsky refusing 
 when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity 
 and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is added stepan arkadyevich 
 kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up he has been at home she thought and find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and here 
 all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at album 
 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a calling at nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in yet it seemed strange to all of them and to anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than to any of the others

 the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase flooded with light and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats from the rooms came a constant steady noise like that of a hive aswarm and as they were giving the final little touches to hair and dresses before a mirror on the landing between potted trees they heard coming from the ballroom the gently distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little ancient in civilian dress arranging his gray curls before another mirror and diffusing an odor of scent stumbled against them on the stairs and stood aside evidently admiring kitty whom he did not know a beardless youth one of those society youths whom the old prince shcherbatsky called whelps in an exceedingly open waistcoat straightening his white tie as he went bowed to them and after running by came back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky she had to promise this youth the second an officer buttoning his glove stood aside in the doorway and stroking his mustache admired the rosy kitty 
 although her dress her coiffure and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty much trouble and planning at this moment she walked into the ballroom in the elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as unconcernedly and simply as though all the rosettes and lace all the minute details of her attire had not cost her or her family a attention as though she had been born in this tulle and lace with this towering coiffure surmounted by a rose and two small leaves 
 when just before entering the ballroom the old princess tried to adjust a sash ribbon that had become twisted kitty had drawn back a little she felt that everything must be right of itself and graceful and that nothing could need setting straight 
 
 kitty had one of her good days her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere her lace bertha did not droop anywhere her rosettes were neither crushed nor torn off her pink slippers with high curving heels did not pinch but gladdened her tiny feet and the thick bandeaux of fair hair kept up on her head all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines the black velvet ribbon of her locket nestled with special tenderness round her neck this velvet ribbon was a darling at home regarding her neck in the looking glass kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet ribbon was a darling kitty smiled here too at the ball when she glanced at it in the glass her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sensation of chill marble a sensation she particularly liked her eyes sparkled and her rosy lips could not help but smile from the consciousness of their own attractiveness she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies waiting to be asked to dance kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz and asked by the best partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned conductor of the dances and master of ceremonies married man handsome and well built iegorushka korsunsky he had only just left the countess banina with whom he had danced the first turn of the waltz and scanning his demesne that is to say a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of kitty entering and flew up to her with that peculiar easy amble which is confined to conductors of the dances bowing and without even asking her if she cared to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she looked round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smiling to her took it 
 how good of you to come in good time he said to her embracing her waist such a bad habit to be late 
 bending her left arm she laid it on his shoulder and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly lightly and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music 
 a rest to waltz with you he said to her as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz charming such lightness precision he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well 
 she smiled at his praise and continued to look about the room over his shoulder she was not like a girl at her first ball for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome but she was in the middle stage between these two she was excited and at the same time she had sufficient to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the very flower of society grouped together there impossibly naked was the beauty liddy wife there was the lady of the house there shone the bald pate of krivin always to be found wherever the best people were in that direction gazed the young men not venturing to approach there too she descried stiva and there she saw the charming figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown and he was there kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin with her farsighted eyes knew him at once and was even aware that he was looking at her 
 another turn eh not tired said korsunsky a little out of breath 
 no thank you 
 where shall i take you 
 madame here i think take me to her 
 wherever you command 
 and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight toward the group in the left corner continually saying pardon mesdames pardon pardon mesdames and steering his course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarranging a feather he turned his partner sharply round so that her slim ankles in light transparent stockings were exposed to view and her train floated out in fan shape and covered knees korsunsky bowed set straight his open shirt front and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna kitty flushed took her train from knees and a little giddy looked round seeking anna anna was not in lilac as kitty had so urgently wished but in a black velvet gown showing her full shoulders and bosom that looked as though carved in old ivory and her rounded arms with tiny slender hands the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair her own with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies and a similar one on the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure was not striking all that was noticeable was the little willful tendrils of her curly hair that persisted in escaping on the nape of her neck and on her temples encircling her sculptured strong neck was a thread of pearls 
 kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was precisely in that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and animated 
 she was standing as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned toward him 
 no i cast a stone she was saying in answer to something though i understand it she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward kitty with a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks you came into the room dancing she added 
 this is one of my most faithful supporters said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen the princess helps to make any ball festive and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz he said bending down to her 
 why have you met inquired their host 
 is there anyone we have not met my wife and i are like white wolves everyone knows us answered korsunsky a waltz anna arkadyevna 
 i dance whenever possible not to she said 
 but tonight impossible answered korsunsky 
 during the conversation vronsky was approaching them 
 well since impossible tonight let us start she said not noticing bow and hastily put her hand on shoulder 
 what is she vexed with him about thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret at not having seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing as she listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterward for several years this look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame 
 pardon pardon waltz waltz shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing

 vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordstone when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future popular theater and only once did the conversation touch her to the quick when he asked her whether levin were here and added that he liked him very much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a sinking heart to the mazurka she fancied that the mazurka would decide everything the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance it with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna since the beginning of the evening and now she again suddenly saw her as quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously curving her lips and the distinct grace precision and lightness of her movements 
 who is it she asked herself all or one and without keeping up her end of the conversation the thread of which the harassed young man she was dancing with lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chaine and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart no not admiration of the crowd that has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips she seemed to make an effort to control herself in order not to show these signs of delight but they appeared on her face of themselves but what of him kitty looked at him and was horrified what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of face she saw in him what had become of his always calm firm manner and the carelessly calm expression of his face now every time he turned to her he bent his head as though he would have fallen at her feet and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread i would not offend you his eyes seemed to be saying each time but i want to save myself and i know how on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before 
 they were speaking of common acquaintances keeping up the smallest of small talk but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers and strangely enough although they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovich was with his french and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match these words were yet fraught with significance for them and they sensed this as much as kitty did the whole ball the whole world everything seemed screened by a fog within soul nothing but the stern discipline of her supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her that is to dance to answer questions to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners and now she was not dancing the mazurka she had not even a hope of being asked for it because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home yet she had not the strength to do this she felt crushed 
 she went to the farthest end of the second drawing room and sank into a low chair her light transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hanging listlessly was lost in the folds of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan and with rapid short strokes fanned her burning face yet while she looked like a butterfly clinging to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight her heart ached with a horrible despair 
 but perhaps i am wrong perhaps it was not so and again she recalled all she had seen 
 kitty what is it said countess nordstone stepping noiselessly over the carpet toward her i understand it 
 lower lip began to quiver she got up quickly 
 kitty not dancing the mazurka 
 no no said kitty in a voice shaking with tears 
 he asked her for the mazurka in my presence said countess nordstone knowing kitty would understand who he and her were she said why you going to dance it with princess shcherbatskaia 
 oh it matter to me answered kitty 
 no one but she herself understood her position no one knew that she had refused yesterday the man whom perhaps she loved and refused him because she had put her faith in another 
 countess nordstone found korsunsky with whom she was to dance the mazurka and told him to ask kitty 
 kitty danced in the first couple and luckily for her she had not to talk because korsunsky was all the time running about overseeing his demesne vronsky and anna were sitting almost opposite her she saw them with her farsighted eyes and saw them too close by when they met in the figures and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was consummated she saw that they felt themselves alone in this crowded room and on face always so firm and independent she saw the look that had struck her of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong 
 anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew eyes to face she was charming in her simple black dress charming were her round arms with their bracelets charming was her firm neck with its thread of pearls charming the straying curls of her loose hair charming the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands charming was that lovely face in its animation yet there was something terrible and cruel in her charm 
 kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute did her suffering grow kitty felt crushed and her face showed it when vronsky caught sight of her coming upon her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her so changed was she 
 delightful ball he said to her merely for the sake of saying something 
 yes she answered 
 in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned kitty and another lady kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady 
 yes there is something uncanny devilish and charming about her said kitty to herself 
 anna did not want to stay for supper but the master of the house began urging her 
 nonsense anna arkadyevna said korsunsky placing her bare hand upon his coat sleeve such an idea for a cotillon un bijou 
 and he moved gradually on trying to draw her along with him their host smiled approvingly 
 no not going to stay answered anna smiling but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay 
 no why as it is i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in peterburg said anna looking round at vronsky who stood near her i must rest a little before my journey 
 are you definitely going tomorrow then asked vronsky 
 yes i suppose so answered anna as though wondering at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it 
 anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper but went home

 anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew eyes to face she was charming in her simple black dress charming were her round arms with their bracelets charming was her firm neck with its thread of pearls charming the straying curls of her loose hair charming the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands charming was that lovely face in its animation yet there was something terrible and cruel in her charm 
 kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute did her suffering grow kitty felt crushed and her face showed it when vronsky caught sight of her coming upon her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her so changed was she 
 delightful ball he said to her merely for the sake of saying something 
 yes she answered 
 in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned kitty and another lady kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady 
 yes there is something uncanny devilish and charming about her said kitty to herself 
 anna did not want to stay for supper but the master of the house began urging her 
 nonsense anna arkadyevna said korsunsky placing her bare hand upon his coat sleeve such an idea for a cotillon un bijou 
 and he moved gradually on trying to draw her along with him their host smiled approvingly 
 no not going to stay answered anna smiling but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay 
 no why as it is i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in peterburg said anna looking round at vronsky who stood near her i must rest a little before my journey 
 are you definitely going tomorrow then asked vronsky 
 yes i suppose so answered anna as though wondering at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it 
 anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper but went home

 yes there must be something disgusting repulsive about me reflected levin as he left the and set out on foot for his lodgings and i get on with other people pride they say no i even pride if i had any pride i should not have put myself in such a position and he pictured to himself vronsky happy clever and calm certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening yes she was bound to choose him it must be so and i cannot complain of anyone or anything i am myself to blame what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine who am i and what am i a nobody not wanted by anyone nor of use to anybody and he recalled his brother nikolai and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him he right in saying that everything in the world is bad and vile and are we fair in our judgment present and past of brother nikolai of course from the point of view of procophii seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy a despicable person but i know him differently i know his soul and know that we are alike and i instead of going to seek him out went out to dinner and then came here levin walked up to a lamppost read his address which was in his pocketbook and called a cabby all the long way to his levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother life he remembered how his brother while at the university and for a year afterward had in spite of the jeers of his companions lived like a monk strictly observing all religious rites services and fasts and avoiding every sort of pleasure especially women and now afterward he had all at once broken out had associated with the most horrible people and rushed into the most senseless debauchery he remembered later the scandal over a boy whom he had taken from the country to bring up and in a fit of rage had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for personal injury then he remembered the scandal with a sharper to whom he had lost money and given a promissory note and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint asserting that he had cheated him this was the money sergei ivanovich had paid then he remembered how he had spent a night in a police station for disorderly conduct in the street he remembered the shameful proceedings he had instituted against his brother sergei ivanovich accusing him of not having paid him apparently his share of his estate and the last scandal when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder it was all horribly vile yet to levin it appeared not at all as vile as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolai did not know all his story did not know his heart 
 levin remembered that when nikolai had been in the devout stage the period of fasts and monks and church services when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament everyone far from encouraging him had jeered at him and levin had too with the others they had teased him calling him noah and monk yet when he had broken out no one had helped him but had all turned away from him with horror and loathing 
 levin felt that brother nikolai in spite of all the ugliness of his life in his soul in the very depths of his soul was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled character and some pressure upon his intellect for he had always wanted to be good i will tell him everything without reserve and i will make him speak without reserve too and show him that i love him and therefore understand him levin resolved to himself as toward eleven he reached the hotel of which he had the address 
 at the top twelve and thirteen the porter answered inquiry 
 at home 
 probably he is at home 
 the door of no was half open and together with a streak of light there issued thick fumes of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he knew at once that his brother was there he recognized his cough 
 as he went in at the door the unknown voice was saying 
 it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the done 
 konstantin levin looked in at the door and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair wearing a russian coat and that a young woman in a woollen gown without collar or cuffs was sitting on the sofa his brother was not to be seen konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life no one had heard him and konstantin taking off his galoshes listened to what the gentleman in the russian coat was saying he was speaking of some enterprise 
 well the devil flay them these privileged classes his voice responded with a cough masha get us some supper and serve up some wine if any left or else send for some 
 the woman rose came out from behind the partition and saw konstantin 
 some gentleman here nikolai dmitrievich she said 
 whom do you want said the voice of nikolai levin angrily 
 i answered konstantin levin coming forward into the light 
 i voice said again still more angrily he could be heard getting up hurriedly stumbling against something and levin saw facing him in the doorway the big scared eyes and the huge gaunt stooping figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its oddity and sickliness 
 he was even thinner than three years before when konstantin levin had seen him last he was wearing a short coat and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever his hair had grown thinner the same straight mustache hid his lips the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor 
 ah kostia he exclaimed suddenly recognizing his brother and his eyes lighted up with joy but the same second he looked round at the young man and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well as if his cravat were choking him and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rested on his emaciated face 
 i wrote to you and sergei ivanovich both that i know you and want to know you what is it you want 
 he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him the worst and most oppressive part of his character which made all relations with him so difficult had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him and now when he saw his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remembered it all 
 i want to see you for anything he answered timidly simply come to see you 
 his timidity obviously softened nikolai his lips twitched 
 oh so it he said well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this is he said addressing his brother and indicating the gentleman in the russian coat this is mr kritsky a friend of my kiev days a very remarkable man persecuted by the police of course since not a scoundrel 
 and he surveyed as it was a habit of his everyone in the room seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was starting to go he shouted to her wait a minute i said and with that inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin knew so well he began with another look round at everyone to tell story to his brother how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benevolent society for the poor students and classes on sunday and how he had afterward been a teacher in a rural school and had been driven out of that too and had afterward been on trial for something or other 
 of the kiev university said konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that followed 
 yes i was in kiev kritsky replied angrily his face darkening 
 and this woman nikolai levin interrupted him pointing to her is my lifemate marya nikolaevna i took her out of a dive and he jerked his neck as he said it but i love her and respect her and anyone who wants to know me he added raising his voice and knitting his brows is requested to love her and respect her precisely the same as a wife to me precisely so now you know whom got to do with and if you think lowering yourself well the door and god speed thee 
 and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them 
 but how will i lower myself i understand 
 then masha tell them to bring supper three portions and vodka and wine no wait a minute no it matter go ahead

 so you see pursued nikolai levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching 
 it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do 
 here do you see he pointed to some sort of short iron bars fastened together with twine lying in a corner of the room do you see that the beginning of a new enterprise going into this enterprise will be an industrial association 
 konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from nikolai levin went on talking 
 you know that capital oppresses the worker our workers the mouzhiks bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that no matter how much they work they escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society is so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed he finished up and looked questioningly at his brother 
 yes of course said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his projecting cheekbones 
 and so founding a association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production everything will be in common 
 where is the association to be asked konstantin levin 
 in the village of vozdrem government of kazan 
 but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a association in a village 
 why because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were and why you and sergei ivanovich like people to try and get them out of their slavery said nikolai levin exasperated by the objection 
 konstantin levin sighed looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolai still more 
 i know sergei and your aristocratic views i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils 
 i say why do you talk of sergei ivanovich levin let drop smiling 
 sergei ivanovich tell you why nikolai levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergei ivanovich tell you why but the use of talking only one thing what did you come to me for you look down on all this very well then but go away in name go away he shrieked getting up from his chair go away go away 
 i look down on it at all said konstantin levin timidly i even dispute it 
 at that instant marya nikolaevna came back nikolai levin looked round angrily at her she went quickly to him and whispered something 
 not well grown irritable said nikolai levin getting calmer and breathing painfully and then you talk to me of sergei ivanovich and his essay such rubbish such lying such what can a man write about justice who knows nothing of it have you read his essay he turned to kritsky sitting down again at the table and clearing a space for himself by pushing back some cigarettes 
 i kritsky responded gloomily obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation 
 why not said nikolai levin now turning with exasperation upon kritsky 
 because i see the use of wasting my time over it 
 oh if you please how did you know it would be wasting your time that too deep for many people that is to say over their heads but different with me i see through his ideas and i know wherein the weakness lies 
 they all fell silent kritsky got up sluggishly and reached for his cap 
 you have supper all right come round tomorrow with the locksmith 
 kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolai levin smiled and winked 
 he too is poor stuff he said for i can see 
 but at that instant kritsky at the door called him 
 what do you want now he said and went out to him in the passage left alone with marya nikolaevna levin turned to her 
 have you been long with my brother he said to her 
 yes more than a year his health has become very poor he drinks a great deal she said 
 just how 
 he drinks vodka and bad for him 
 and a great deal whispered levin 
 yes she said looking timidly toward the doorway where nikolai levin had reappeared 
 what were you talking about he said knitting his brows and turning his scared eyes from one to the other what was it 
 oh nothing konstantin answered in confusion 
 oh if you want to say only no good your talking to her a wench and a gentleman he said with a jerk of the neck you understand everything i see and have taken stock of everything and look with commiseration on my transgressions he began again raising his voice 
 nikolai dmitrich nikolai dmitrich whispered marya nikolaevna again going up to him 
 oh very well very well but the supper ah here it is he said seeing a waiter with a tray here set it here he added angrily and promptly seizing the vodka he poured out a pony and drank it greedily like a drink he turned to his brother and at once became well enough of sergei ivanovich glad to see you anyway after said and done not strangers come have a drink tell me what doing he went on greedily munching a piece of bread and pouring out another pony how are things with you 
 i live alone in the country as i always have busy looking after the land answered konstantin watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank and trying to conceal that he noticed it 
 why you get married 
 no opportunity has presented itself konstantin answered reddening 
 why not for me now at an end made a mess of my life but this said and i say still that if my share had been given me when i needed it my whole life would have been different 
 konstantin made haste to change the conversation 
 do you know your little with me a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe 
 nikolai jerked his neck and sank into thought 
 yes tell me going on at pokrovskoe is the house still standing and the birch trees and our schoolroom and philip the gardener is he living how i remember the summerhouse and the sofa now mind and alter anything in the house but make haste and get married and make everything as it used to be again then come and see you if your wife is a fine woman 
 why come to me now said levin how snugly we could settle down 
 come and see you if i were sure i find sergei ivanovich 
 you find him there i live quite independently of him 
 yes but say what you like you have to choose between me and him he said looking timidly into his face 
 this timidity touched konstantin 
 if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject i tell you that in your quarrel with sergei ivanovich i take neither side both wrong rather wrong outwardly and he rather inwardly 
 ah ah you see that you see that nikolai shouted joyfully 
 but i personally value friendly relations with you more because 
 why why 
 konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolai was unhappy and needed affection but nikolai knew that this was just what he meant to say and scowling he took to the vodka again 
 enough nikolai dmitrich said marya nikolaevna stretching out her plump bare arm toward the decanter 
 let it be annoy me beat you he shouted 
 marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and smile which was at once reflected on face and whisked the decanter off 
 and do you suppose she understands nothing said nikolai she understands everything better than all of us tell the truth there something good and sweet about her 
 were you never before in moscow konstantin said to her for the sake of saying something 
 only you be formal with her it frightens her no one ever spoke to her so but the justice of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill fame my god what senselessness there is in this world he cried suddenly these new institutions these justices of the peace these zemstvo what hideousness it all is 
 and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions 
 konstantin levin listened to him and that disbelief in the sense of all public institutions which he shared with him and often expressed was now distasteful to him coming from his lips 
 in the other world we shall understand it all he said lightly 
 in the other world ah i like that other world i like it he said letting his scared wild eyes rest on his face here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess own and other would be a good thing and yet afraid of death awfully afraid of death he shuddered but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere go to the gypsies do you know gotten very fond of the gypsies and of russian songs 
 his speech had begun to falter and he skipped at random from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere and got him to bed hopelessly drunk 
 masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolai to go and stay with his brother

 only you be formal with her it frightens her no one ever spoke to her so but the justice of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill fame my god what senselessness there is in this world he cried suddenly these new institutions these justices of the peace these zemstvo what hideousness it all is 
 and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions 
 konstantin levin listened to him and that disbelief in the sense of all public institutions which he shared with him and often expressed was now distasteful to him coming from his lips 
 in the other world we shall understand it all he said lightly 
 in the other world ah i like that other world i like it he said letting his scared wild eyes rest on his face here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess own and other would be a good thing and yet afraid of death awfully afraid of death he shuddered but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere go to the gypsies do you know gotten very fond of the gypsies and of russian songs 
 his speech had begun to falter and he skipped at random from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere and got him to bed hopelessly drunk 
 masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolai to go and stay with his brother

 in the morning konstantin levin left moscow and toward evening he reached home on the journey in the train he talked to his fellow travelers about politics and the new railways and just as in moscow he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas by dissatisfaction with himself and shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station when he saw his coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turned up when in the dim light falling through the station windows he saw his own carpeted sledge his own horses with their tails up in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage told him the village news that the contractor had arrived and that pava had calved he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up and the shame and were passing away he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses but he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light when he had put on the sheepskin coat brought for him and all muffled up had taken his seat in the sleigh and started off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village and staring at the off horse that had been formerly his saddle horse overridden but a spirited animal from the don he felt himself and did not want to be anyone else all he wanted now was to be better than before in the first place he resolved that from that day on he would give up hoping for the extraordinary happiness which the marriage was to afford him and consequently he would not disdain the present so in the second place he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to propose then remembering his brother nikolai he resolved that he would never allow himself to forget him that he would watch him and not lose sight of him so as to be ready to help should things go ill with him and that would be soon he felt then too his talk of communism which he had treated so lightly at the time now made him reflect he considered an alteration in economic conditions nonsense yet he had always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the common folk and he now determined that in order to feel quite in the right though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before he would now work still harder and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in most pleasant reveries with a lively feeling of hope in a new better life he drove up to his house about nine at night

 kitty too did not come sending a note that she had a headache dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess whether it was because children are fickle or because they have acute senses and they felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her that she was not now interested in them they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt and their love for her and were quite indifferent to her leaving anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances jotted down her accounts and packed altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind but in that worried mood which dolly knew so well in her own case and which does not come without cause and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with oneself after dinner anna went up to her room to dress and dolly followed her 
 how queer you are today dolly said to her 
 i do you think so not queer but nasty i am like that sometimes i keep feeling as if i could cry very stupid but pass off said anna quickly and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs her eyes were particularly bright and were continually dimmed with tears in the same way i want to leave peterburg and now i want to go away from here 
 you came here and did a good deed said dolly looking intently at her 
 eyes were wet with tears as she looked at her

 every heart has its own skeleton as the english say

 i have said anna suddenly and unexpectedly after her tears a sly mocking smile puckered her lips 
 come amusing anyway your skeleton and not depressing said dolly smiling 
 no he is depressing do you know why going today instead of tomorrow this is a confession that weighs on me i want to make you its recipient said anna resolutely letting herself drop into an armchair and looking straight into face

 yes anna went on do you know why kitty come to dinner jealous of me i have spoiled been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure but truly truly not my fault or only my fault a little bit she said daintily drawling the words a little bit

 anna was hurt 
 oh no oh no not stiva she said knitting her brows why telling you just because i do not even for an instant permit myself to doubt about myself said anna 
 but at the very moment she was uttering the words she felt that they were not true she was not merely doubting about herself she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky and was going away sooner than she had meant solely to avoid meeting him 
 yes stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him and that he 
 you imagine how absurdly it all came about i only meant to be matchmaking and all at once it turned out quite differently possibly against my own will 
 she flushed and stopped 
 oh they feel it immediately said dolly 
 but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side anna interrupted her and certain it will all be forgotten and kitty will leave off hating me 
 all the same anna to tell you the truth not very anxious for this marriage for kitty and better it should come to nothing if he vronsky is capable of falling in love with you in a single day 
 oh heavens that would be too silly said anna and again a deep flush of pleasure appeared on her face as she heard the idea that absorbed her put into words and so here i am going away having made an enemy of kitty whom i liked so much ah how sweet she is but make it right dolly eh 
 dolly could scarcely suppress a smile she loved anna but she was pleased to see that she too had her weaknesses 
 an enemy that be 
 i did so want you all to care for me as i do for you and now i care for you more than ever said anna with tears in her eyes ah how silly i am today

 yes i want to get a breath of air very hot in here 
 and she opened the door the blizzard and the wind rushed to meet her and began to contend with her for the door and even this seemed joyful to her she opened the door and stepped out this seemed to be all that the wind had been lying in wait for it set up a gleeful whistle and was about to snatch her up and whirl her away but she clutched the cold doorpost and holding on to her shawl descended to the platform and the shelter of the car the wind had been mighty on the steps but on the platform in the lee of the train there was a lull with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the snowy frosty air and standing near the car looked about the platform and the lighted station

 the frightful storm raged and whistled between the wheels of the cars along the posts around the corner of the station the cars posts people everything in sight were covered with snow on one side and were getting more and more snowed under for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would again swoop down with such gusts that it seemed impossible to withstand it meanwhile some men or other were dashing about gaily talking to one another making the boards of the platform creak and ceaselessly opening and shutting the big doors a stooping human shadow glided by at her feet and she heard a hammer tapping upon iron have the telegram came an angry voice out of the stormy murk on the other side this way no other voices were also shouting and muffled figures scurried by plastered with snow two gentlemen passed by her cigarettes glowing in their mouths she drew in one more deep breath and had just taken her hand out of her muff to grasp the doorpost and enter the car when still another man in a military overcoat quite close beside her stepped between her and the flickering light of a lantern she looked round and the same instant recognized face putting his hand to the peak of his cap he bowed to her and asked if there anything she wanted whether he could not be of some service to her she gazed rather long at him without any answer and in spite of the shadow in which he was standing she saw or fancied she saw the expression both of his face and his eyes it was again that expression of reverent rapture which had affected her so yesterday more than once she had told herself during the past few days and only just now that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men forever exactly the same that one meets everywhere that she would never permit herself even to think of him yet now at the first flush of meeting him she was seized by an emotion of joyous pride she had no need to ask why he was here she knew as surely as if he had told her that he was here only to be where she was 
 i know you were going and why are you going she said letting fall the hand which had grasped the doorpost and irrepressible joy and animation shone in her face 
 why am i going he repeated looking straight into her eyes you know that i am going to be where you are he said i cannot do otherwise 
 and at this very point as though it had overcome all obstacles the wind scattered the snow from the car roofs and began to flutter some sheet of iron it had torn off while the whistle of the engine set up a roar in front dismal and lamenting all the awesomeness of the blizzard now seemed still more splendid to her he had uttered precisely what her soul yearned for but which her reason dreaded she made no answer and in her face he beheld a struggle 
 forgive me if what i have said displeases you he said humbly 
 he had spoken courteously deferentially yet so firmly so obdurately that for long she could find no answer 
 what you say is wrong and i beg of you if you are a good man to forget what you have said even as i shall forget it she said at last 
 not a single word of yours nor a single gesture shall i ever forget nor could i forget 
 enough enough she cried vainly attempting to give a stern expression to her face which he was avidly scrutinizing clutching at the cold doorpost she clambered up the steps and quickly entered the corridor of the car but in this little corridor she paused reviewing in her imagination all that had occurred without recalling her own words or his she realized instinctively that that conversation had brought them fearfully closer and she was both frightened and made happy thereby after standing thus a few seconds she went into the car and sat down in her place that tensed state which had tormented her at first was not only renewed but grew greater and reached such a pitch that she was afraid that at any moment something would snap within her from the excessive tension she did not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the reveries that filled her imagination there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy on the contrary there was something joyous glowing and exhilarating toward morning anna dozed off as she sat and when she awoke it was already light and the train was nearing peterburg at once thoughts of home of her husband and son and the details of the day ahead and days to follow came thronging upon her 
 at peterburg as soon as the train stopped and she got out the first face that attracted her attention was that of her husband oh my god what has happened to his ears she thought looking at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ears that struck her so now as they propped up the brim of his round hat catching sight of her he went to meet her pursing his lips into their habitual mocking smile and fixing her with his big tired eyes some unpleasant sensation contracted her heart as she met his obdurate and tired glance as though she had expected to see him a different man she was particularly struck by that feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced on meeting him this was an intimate familiar feeling like that state of dissimulation which she experienced in her relations with her husband but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling now she was clearly and painfully aware of it 
 yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as he was during the second year after marriage was consumed by the desire of seeing you he said in his dilatory voice and in that tone which he almost always used to her a tone of bantering at anyone who should speak thus in earnest 
 is seriozha quite well she asked 
 and is this all the reward said he for my ardor well quite well

 vronsky had not even attempted to fall asleep all that night he sat in his armchair his eyes fixed before him or scanning the people who got in and out and if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and aroused people who did not know him by his air of unshakable calmness he now seemed prouder and more than ever he regarded people as if they were things a nervous young man a clerk in a law court who had the seat opposite his conceived a hatred for him because of this air the young man asked him for a light and entered into conversation with him and even jostled him to make him feel that he was not a thing but a man but vronsky kept on regarding him as if he were a lamppost and the young man grimaced feeling that he was losing his under the oppressiveness of this refusal to recognize him as a human being 
 vronsky saw nothing and no one he felt himself a king not because he believed that he had made any impression on anna he did not yet believe that but because the impression she had made on him afforded him happiness and pride 
 what would come of it all he did not know or even think he felt that all his forces hitherto dissolute scattered were centered on one thing and bent with fearful energy toward one blissful goal and therein lay his happiness he did but know that he had told her the truth that he had come where she was that all the happiness of life the sole meaning in life for him now lay in seeing her and hearing her voice and when he got out of his car at bologovo to get some seltzer water and had caught sight of anna his very first word had involuntarily told her his very thoughts and he was glad he had told her that she knew now and was thinking of it he did not sleep all night back in his compartment he incessantly kept ruminating upon every posture in which he had seen her every word she had uttered and in his imagination making his heart swoon floated pictures of a possible future 
 when he got out of the train at peterburg he felt after his sleepless night as lively and fresh as after a cold bath he paused near his car waiting for her to emerge once more he said to himself smiling unconsciously once more i shall see her walk her face she may say something turn her head glance smile perhaps but before he caught sight of her he saw her husband whom the stationmaster was deferentially escorting through the crowd ah yes the husband only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was someone attached to her a husband he had known that she had a husband but had hardly believed in his existence and only now when he saw him did he fully believe in him with his head and shoulders and his legs especially when he saw this husband placidly take her arm with a consciousness of proprietorship 
 seeing alexei alexandrovich with his peterburg face and austerely figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believed in him and was aware of a disagreeable sensation such as might be felt by a man who tortured by thirst finds on reaching a spring a dog a sheep or a pig therein that has not only drunk of it but also muddied the water alexei manner of walking gyrating his whole pelvis and his flat feet was especially offensive to vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same and the sight of her affected him the same way physically reviving him stirring him and filling his soul with happiness he told his german valet who ran up to him from the second class to take his things and go on he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife and noted with a insight the sign of the slight embarrassment with which she spoke to her husband no she does not love him and cannot love him he decided to himself 
 at the very moment that he was approaching anna arkadyevna from the back he noticed with joy that she was conscious of his drawing near and that she looked round after which seeing him she turned again to her husband 
 have you had a good night he said bowing both to her and to her husband and leaving it to alexei alexandrovich to accept the bow on his own account and to return it or not as he might see fit 
 thank you a very good one she answered 
 her face seemed tired and lacking in that play of animation which usually hovered between her smile and her eyes but for a single instant as she glanced at him something flashed in her eyes and although this flash died away at once he was made happy by that moment she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky alexei alexandrovich was regarding vronsky with displeasure trying to recall who he was calmness and had here run up like a scythe against a stone on the frigid of alexei alexandrovich 
 count vronsky said anna 
 ah we are acquainted i believe said alexei alexandrovich apathetically proffering his hand you set out with the mother and return with the son he said to anna articulating distinctly as though each word were a coin of high value bestowed by him on his hearers back from leave i suppose he said and without waiting for a reply he addressed his wife in his bantering tone well were a great many tears shed in moscow at parting 
 by addressing his wife thus he meant vronsky to perceive that he wished to be left alone and turning slightly toward him he touched his hat but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna 
 i hope to have the honor of calling on you he said 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky 
 delighted he said coldly at home mondays then dismissing vronsky entirely he said to his wife i am rather lucky to have just half an hour to meet you so that i can prove to you my fondness he went on in the same bantering tone 
 you lay too great a stress on your fondness for me to value it very much she responded in the same bantering tone involuntarily listening to the sound of steps behind them but what have i to do with that she said to herself and began questioning her husband as to how seriozha had got on without her 
 oh capitally mariette says he has been a very darling boy and i must disappoint you but he has not languished for you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for bestowing a whole day upon me our dear samovar will be enraptured he called the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was bubbling over with excitement on any and every occasion she has been asking for you and know if i may venture to advise you you ought to go to see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares anxious about the reconciliation of the oblonskys 
 the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her and the center of that one of the coteries of the peterburg beau monde with which anna was through her husband in the closest rapport 
 but i wrote to her 
 yes but she must have full details go to see her if not too tired my dear well kondratii will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee once more i shall not be alone at dinner alexei alexandrovich continued but no longer in a jesting tone you believe how grown used to you 
 and with a prolonged pressure of her hand and a particular smile he helped her into her carriage

 oh capitally mariette says he has been a very darling boy and i must disappoint you but he has not languished for you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for bestowing a whole day upon me our dear samovar will be enraptured he called the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was bubbling over with excitement on any and every occasion she has been asking for you and know if i may venture to advise you you ought to go to see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares anxious about the reconciliation of the oblonskys 
 the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her and the center of that one of the coteries of the peterburg beau monde with which anna was through her husband in the closest rapport 
 but i wrote to her 
 yes but she must have full details go to see her if not too tired my dear well kondratii will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee once more i shall not be alone at dinner alexei alexandrovich continued but no longer in a jesting tone you believe how grown used to you 
 and with a prolonged pressure of her hand and a particular smile he helped her into her carriage

 the first person to meet anna at home was her son he dashed down the stairs to her in spite of the call and with frenzied rapture shrieked mother mother running up to her he hung on her neck 
 i told you it was mother he shouted to the governess i knew it 
 and her son like her husband aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment in her imagination he had been better than he was in reality she had to descend to reality to enjoy him as he was but even so he was charming with his fair curls his blue eyes and his chubby graceful little legs in tightly stockings anna experienced an almost physical delight in the sensation of his nearness and his caresses and a moral reassurance when she met his ingenuous trusting and loving glance and heard his naive questions anna took out the presents children had sent him and told her son about tania a little girl in moscow and how tania could read and even taught the other children 
 why am i not as good as she asked seriozha 
 to me better than anyone else in the whole world 
 i know that said seriozha smiling 
 anna had scarcely drunk her coffee when the countess lidia ivanovna was announced the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall fleshy woman with an unwholesomely yellow complexion and beautiful pensive black eyes anna liked her but today she seemed for the first time to see her with all her shortcomings 
 well my friend were you the bearer of the olive branch asked countess lidia ivanovna the minute she entered the room 
 yes all over but it was not at all as serious as we thought answered anna my is in general much too categorical 
 but countess lidia ivanovna who was interested in everything that did not concern her had a habit of never listening to what interested her she interrupted anna 
 yes plenty of sorrow and evil in the world and i am so fatigued today 
 oh why asked anna trying to repress a smile 
 beginning to weary of vainly breaking lances for the truth and at times altogether unstrung the affair with our dear sisters this was a religiously patriotic philanthropic institution started off splendidly but impossible to do anything with such people added countess lidia ivanovna with a mocking submissiveness to fate they pounced on the idea and mangled it and afterward they thrash it out so pettily and trivially two or three people your husband among them grasp all the significance of this affair but the others merely degrade it yesterday pravdin wrote to me 
 pravdin was a abroad and countess lidia ivanovna told the gist of his letter 
 next the countess spoke of other unpleasantnesses and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches and departed in haste since that day she had to attend the meeting of another society and also a slavonic committee 
 all this is as it has always been but how is it i notice it before anna asked herself or has she been very much irritated today really ludicrous her object is to do good a christian yet forever angry and forever having enemies and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good 
 after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came the wife of a director of the department who told her all the news of the town at three she too went away promising to come to dinner alexei alexandrovich was at the ministry anna left alone spent the time till dinner in lending her presence to her dinner he dined apart from his parents in putting her things in order and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her escritoire 
 the feeling of unreasoning shame which she had felt during the journey and her agitation had completely vanished in the accustomed conditions of her life she again felt herself firm and irreproachable 
 she recalled with wonder her state of mind only yesterday what was it nothing vronsky said something silly which it was easy to put an end to and i answered just as i should have to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and impermissible to speak of it would be to attach importance to that which has none she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost declaration made her in peterburg by a young man a subordinate of her and how alexei alexandrovich had answered that every woman of the world was exposed to this sort of thing but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact and would never permit himself to degrade her and himself by jealousy so then no reason to say anything and thank god there anything to say she told herself

 alexei alexandrovich came back from the ministry at four but as often happened had no chance to drop in at her room he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions and to sign certain papers brought him by his head clerk at dinnertime there were always at least three people dining with the karenins there arrived an old lady a cousin of alexei alexandrovich the director of the department and his wife and a young man who had been recommended to alexei alexandrovich for a post anna went into the drawing room to entertain these guests precisely at five before the bronze peter the first clock had finished the fifth stroke alexei alexandrovich made his entry in white tie and evening coat with two stars as he had to go out directly after dinner every minute of alexei life was taken up and apportioned and in order to accomplish all that each day held for him he adhered to the strictest orderliness nor haste nor rest was his device he entered the dining hall bowed to all and hurriedly sat down smiling to his wife 
 yes my solitude is over you believe how uncomfortable he laid stress on the word uncomfortable it is to dine alone 
 at dinner he chatted with his wife about things at moscow and asked with his mocking smile about stepan arkadyevich but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with the official and public news of peterburg after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna went that evening neither to the princess betsy tverskaia who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening her principal reason for not going out was because the dress she had expected to wear was not ready all in all anna was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening after the departure of her guests before her departure for moscow she who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well yet inexpensively had given her dressmaker three dresses to make over the dresses were to be made over so that their old selves would be unrecognizable and they should have been ready three days ago it turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready while the other one had not been made over to liking the dressmaker came to explain asserting that her way was best and anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection to regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son putting him to bed herself making the sign of the cross over him and tucking him in she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and calm she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down near the fireplace with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at nine she heard his ring and he entered the room 
 here you are at last she observed extending her hand to him 
 he kissed her hand and sat down beside her 
 all in all i can see your trip was a success he said to her 
 yes very much so said she and she began telling him everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaia her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterward for dolly 
 i do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man even though he is your brother said alexei alexandrovich sternly 
 anna smiled she knew that he said this precisely to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion she knew this trait in her husband and liked it 
 i am glad everything has ended so well and that you have returned he went on well and what do they say there about the new bill i have got passed in the council 
 anna had heard nothing of this bill and she felt that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance 
 here on the other hand this has created a great deal of talk said he with a smile 
 she saw that alexei alexandrovich wanted to tell her something that pleased him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same smile he told her of the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had passed 
 i was very very happy it shows that at last an intelligent and firm view of the matter is forming among us 
 after his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexei alexandrovich got up and went toward his study 
 and you went nowhere this evening you really bored he said 
 oh no she answered getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study what are you reading now she asked 
 just now reading duc de lille posie des enfers he answered a most remarkable book 
 anna smiled as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love and putting her hand in his she kept him company to the door of his study she knew his habit now become a necessity of reading in the evening she knew too that in spite of his official duties which engrossed almost all his time he deemed it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual sphere she knew too that his actual interest lay in books dealing with politics philosophy and theology that art was utterly foreign to his nature but in spite of this or rather in consequence of it alexei alexandrovich never missed anything which created a sensation in the world of art but made it his duty to read everything she knew that in politics in philosophy in theology alexei alexandrovich was a doubter and a seeker yet in matters of art and poetry and above all of music of which he was totally devoid of understanding he had the most definite and decided opinions he was fond of discoursing on shakespeare raphael beethoven on the significance of new schools of poetry and music all of which were classified by him with most obvious consistency 
 well god be with you she said at the door of the study where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already placed near his armchair as for me going to write to moscow 
 he squeezed her hand and again kissed it 
 still a good man truthful kindhearted and remarkable in his own sphere anna said to herself back in her room as though defending him before someone who accused him saying that one could not love him but why is it his ears stick out so queerly or has he had his hair cut 
 exactly at twelve as anna was still sitting at her desk finishing a letter to dolly she heard the sound of measured slippered steps and alexei alexandrovich washed and combed a book under his arm approached her 
 come come said he with a particular smile and passed on into their bedroom 
 and what right had he to look at him like that reflected anna recalling how vronsky had looked at alexei alexandrovich 
 having disrobed she went into the bedroom but her face had none of the animation which during her stay at moscow had fairly spurted from her eyes and her smile on the contrary now the fire seemed extinct in her or hidden somewhere far away

 upon his departure from peterburg vronsky had left his large apartments on morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky 
 petritsky was a young lieutenant not particularly and not merely not wealthy but in debt all around toward evening he was always drunk and he had often found himself in the guardhouse because of sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scrapes but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers at twelve as vronsky was driving up from the station to his quarters he saw near the entrance of the house a hired carriage familiar to him even as he rang he heard beyond the door masculine laughter the twitter of a feminine voice and shout if one of the villains let him in vronsky told the servant not to announce him and slipped noiselessly into the first room baroness shilton a friend of with a rosy little face and resplendent in a lilac satin gown and filling the whole room like a canary with her parisian accents sat at a round table brewing coffee petritsky in his overcoat and the cavalry captain kamerovsky in full uniform probably just come from duty were sitting near her 
 bravo vronsky shouted petritsky jumping up scraping his chair our host himself baroness some coffee for him out of the new coffeepot there we expect you i hope satisfied with the adornment of your study he said indicating the baroness you know each other of course 
 i should say so said vronsky with a bright smile squeezing the little hand why old friends 
 just returned after traveling said the baroness so run along oh be off this minute if in the way 
 home wherever you are baroness said vronsky how do you do kamerovsky he added coldly shaking hands with kamerovsky 
 there you can never say such charming things said the baroness turning to petritsky 
 no why not after dinner even i can say things quite as good 
 after dinner no merit in them well then give you some coffee go wash and tidy up said the baroness sitting down again and anxiously turning a gadget in the new coffee urn pierre give me the coffee she said addressing petritsky whom she called pierre playing on his surname making no secret of her relations with him i want to put some more in 
 spoil it 
 no i spoil it well and how is your wife said the baroness suddenly interrupting conversation with his comrade been marrying you off here have you brought your wife along 
 no baroness i was born a gypsy and a gypsy die 
 so much the better so much the better shake hands on it 
 and the baroness detaining vronsky began telling him interspersing her story with many jokes about her latest plans of life and seeking his counsel 
 he persists in refusing to give me a divorce well what am i to do he was her husband now i want to begin a suit against him what would you advise kamerovsky look after the coffee boiled out you can see taken up with business i want a lawsuit because i must have my property you can understand the stupidity of his saying that i am unfaithful to him she said contemptuously yet through it he wants to get the benefit of my fortune 
 vronsky heard with pleasure this lighthearted prattle of a pretty woman said yes to everything gave her counsel and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women in his peterburg world all people were divided into two utterly opposed kinds one the lower consisted of vulgar stupid and above all ridiculous people who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully wedded that a girl should be innocent a woman modest and a man manly and strong that one ought to bring up children earn bread and pay debts and various similar absurdities those people were of an and ridiculous kind but there was another kind of people real people to which they all belonged and here the chief thing was to be elegant magnanimous daring gay and to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion and to laugh at everything else 
 for the first moment only vronsky was startled after the impressions of a quite different world that he had brought with him from moscow but immediately as though he had thrust his feet into old slippers he stepped into his former lighthearted pleasant world 
 the coffee was really never made but spluttered over everyone and boiled away doing just what was required of it that is providing cause for much noise and laughter and spoiling a costly rug and the gown 
 well now or else never get washed and i shall have on my conscience the worst offense any decent person can commit uncleanliness so you would advise a knife at his throat 
 absolutely and in such a way that your little hand may not be far from his lips kiss it and all will end well answered vronsky 
 so the tonight and with a rustle of her skirts she vanished 
 kamerovsky got up too and vronsky without waiting for him to go shook hands and went off to his dressing room while he was washing petritsky briefly outlined to him his position as far as it had changed since departure from peterburg no money whatsoever his father said he give him any nor pay his debts his tailor was trying to get him locked up and another fellow too was threatening to do so without fail the colonel of his regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease a resignation would be inevitable as for the baroness he was fed up with her particularly because she was forever wanting to give him money but there was another girl he intended showing her to vronsky a marvel exquisite in the strict oriental style genre of the slave rebecca you see he had had a row too with berkoshev and the latter intended sending seconds but of course it would all come to nothing altogether everything was going splendidly and was most jolly and without letting his comrade enter into further details of his position petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in vronsky felt the delightful sensation of coming back to the insouciant and customary life of peterburg 
 impossible he cried releasing the pedal of the wash basin in which he had been sousing his stalwart red neck impossible he cried at the news that laura had dropped fertinghof and had tied up with mileev and is he as stupid and satisfied as ever well and buzulukov doing 
 oh buzulukov got into a scrape simply lovely cried petritsky you know his passion for balls and he never misses a single one at court he went to a big ball in a new casque have you seen the new casques very good and lighter well standing no do listen 
 i am listening answered vronsky rubbing himself with a rough towel 
 the grand duchess passes by with some ambassador or other and as ill luck would have it their talk veers to the new casques and so the grand duchess wanted to show the new casque to the ambassador just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing there petritsky mimicked him standing with his casque the grand duchess requested him to give her the casque he do so up well they all wink at him and nod and frown give it to her do he still just stands there you can picture it to yourself well this his name tries to take the casque from him he give it up this chap tore it from him and hands it to the grand duchess this is the new casque says the grand duchess she turned the casque over and just picture it bang went a pear and candy out of it two pounds of candy collected all that our dear boy 
 vronsky rolled with laughter and long afterward even when he was talking of other things he would go off into peals of his hearty laughter baring his strong closely set teeth whenever he thought of the casque 
 having learned all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended afterward to go to his brother and to betsy and to pay several visits as an entering wedge into that society where he might meet madame karenina as always in peterburg he left home without any intention of returning before very late at night

 absolutely and in such a way that your little hand may not be far from his lips kiss it and all will end well answered vronsky 
 so the tonight and with a rustle of her skirts she vanished 
 kamerovsky got up too and vronsky without waiting for him to go shook hands and went off to his dressing room while he was washing petritsky briefly outlined to him his position as far as it had changed since departure from peterburg no money whatsoever his father said he give him any nor pay his debts his tailor was trying to get him locked up and another fellow too was threatening to do so without fail the colonel of his regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease a resignation would be inevitable as for the baroness he was fed up with her particularly because she was forever wanting to give him money but there was another girl he intended showing her to vronsky a marvel exquisite in the strict oriental style genre of the slave rebecca you see he had had a row too with berkoshev and the latter intended sending seconds but of course it would all come to nothing altogether everything was going splendidly and was most jolly and without letting his comrade enter into further details of his position petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in vronsky felt the delightful sensation of coming back to the insouciant and customary life of peterburg 
 impossible he cried releasing the pedal of the wash basin in which he had been sousing his stalwart red neck impossible he cried at the news that laura had dropped fertinghof and had tied up with mileev and is he as stupid and satisfied as ever well and buzulukov doing 
 oh buzulukov got into a scrape simply lovely cried petritsky you know his passion for balls and he never misses a single one at court he went to a big ball in a new casque have you seen the new casques very good and lighter well standing no do listen 
 i am listening answered vronsky rubbing himself with a rough towel 
 the grand duchess passes by with some ambassador or other and as ill luck would have it their talk veers to the new casques and so the grand duchess wanted to show the new casque to the ambassador just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing there petritsky mimicked him standing with his casque the grand duchess requested him to give her the casque he do so up well they all wink at him and nod and frown give it to her do he still just stands there you can picture it to yourself well this his name tries to take the casque from him he give it up this chap tore it from him and hands it to the grand duchess this is the new casque says the grand duchess she turned the casque over and just picture it bang went a pear and candy out of it two pounds of candy collected all that our dear boy 
 vronsky rolled with laughter and long afterward even when he was talking of other things he would go off into peals of his hearty laughter baring his strong closely set teeth whenever he thought of the casque 
 having learned all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended afterward to go to his brother and to betsy and to pay several visits as an entering wedge into that society where he might meet madame karenina as always in peterburg he left home without any intention of returning before very late at night

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter vi 
 
 which possibly proves intelligence 
 on the afternoon of that same christmas day a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de in paris 
 this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg 
 we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter 
 this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness 
 this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy he wore a very old and very well brushed round hat a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration 
 he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brow his livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life 
 judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty 
 the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively 
 his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe and which was humble 
 there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its knots and it had received a head made from red wax 
 it was a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane 
 there are but few on that boulevard particularly in the winter 
 the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation 
 at that epoch king louis xviii 
 went nearly every day to it was one of his favorite excursions 
 towards two almost invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard de 
 this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said it is two there he is returning to the tuileries 
 and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii 
 produced a certain effect in the streets of paris it was rapid but majestic 
 this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop as he was not able to walk he wished to run 
 that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning 
 he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords 
 his massive couch all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along 
 there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it 
 in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered a royal a proud hard crafty eye the smile of an educated man two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the golden fleece the cross of saint louis the cross of the legion of honor the silver plaque of the a huge belly and a wide blue ribbon it was the king 
 outside of paris he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english gaiters when he the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared coldly at the people and they returned it in kind when he appeared for the first time in the quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government 
 this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the daily event of the boulevard de 
 the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail 
 when at two the royal carriage surrounded by a squadron of the all covered with silver lace debouched on the boulevard after having made the turn of the salpetriere he appeared surprised and almost alarmed there was no one but himself in this he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m le duc de havre from spying him out 
 m le duc de havre as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king 
 he said to his majesty yonder is an man 
 members of the police who were clearing the route took equal note of him one of them received an order to follow him 
 but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to fall the agent lost trace of him as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m le comte minister of state prefect of police 
 when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track he redoubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed 
 at a four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the porte where the two convicts was being played that day 
 this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it an instant later he was in the blind alley of la planchette and he entered the plat the pewter platter where the office of the coach for lagny was then situated 
 this coach set out at four 
 the horses were harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle 
 the man inquired 
 have you a place 
 only me on the box said the coachman 
 i will take it 
 climb up 
 nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made him pay his fare 
 are you going as far as lagny demanded the coachman 
 yes said the man 
 the traveller paid to lagny 
 they started 
 when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in monosyllables 
 the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses 
 the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak 
 it was cold the man did not appear to be thinking of that 
 thus they passed gournay and 
 towards six in the evening they reached chelles 
 the coachman drew up in front of the carters inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey to give his horses a breathing spell 
 i get down here said the man 
 he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle 
 an instant later he had disappeared 
 he did not enter the inn 
 when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles 
 the coachman turned to the inside travellers 
 there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him 
 he had not the air of owning a sou but he does not consider money he pays to lagny and he goes only as far as chelles it is night all the houses are shut he does not enter the inn and he is not to be found 
 so he has dived through the earth 
 the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before 
 he followed this road rapidly 
 at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard people coming 
 he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the were at a distance the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night 
 not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky 
 it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins 
 the man did not return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides 
 once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision 
 at last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts 
 opposite this tree which was an ash there was a suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing 
 he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc 
 then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed 
 that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest 
 it was the man who had just met cosette 
 as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water 
 then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket

 book five 
 chapter xvi 
 
 in april the troops were enlivened by news of the arrival but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at bartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place 
 they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hut dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very cold embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the reception room as denisov called that part of the hut and it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov sat in their shirt sleeves 
 in april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven and eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed his underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk 
 suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut evidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenko 
 i ordered you not to let them that mashka woot stuff denisov was shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields 
 i have given the order again and again your honor but they obey answered the quartermaster 
 rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fuss and bustle now my done and lying down capitally he could hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of was talking as well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions 
 then voice was heard shouting farther and farther away saddle second platoon 
 where are they off to now thought rostov 
 five minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business 
 let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going out and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them 
 there now denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are the provisions 
 so they are said the officers the soldiers be glad 
 a little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking 
 rostov went to meet them 
 i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently very angry was saying 
 i told you i give them up replied denisov 
 you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport of own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days 
 and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov 
 it is robbery answer for it sir said the infantry officer raising his voice 
 now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his temper i shall answer for it and not you and better not buzz about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers 
 very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding away if you are determined to rob 
 go to the devil quick while safe and sound and denisov turned his horse on the officer 
 very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle 
 a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing 
 taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all let our men starve 
 the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared them with the other squadrons 
 the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said 
 this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair may end badly 
 from the regimental denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse feeble voice 
 alarmed at condition rostov suggested that he should undress drink some water and send for the doctor 
 twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but always thwash scoundwels and tell the empewo ice he muttered 
 the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him 
 i get there began denisov now then your quarters they were pointed out please to wait widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me vewy well so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to lecture me wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so you starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what and i fwashing him well had a bit of fun i can tell you cried denisov gleeful and yet angry his showing under his black mustache have killed him if they taken him away 
 but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again 
 denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and cheerful 
 but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into and dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about occurrence the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for 
 the case as represented by the offended parties was that after seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them 
 in answer to renewed questions denisov said laughing that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget 
 denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he feared a and was worried over the affair which was evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital

 cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark 
 cosette as we have said was not frightened 
 the man accosted her 
 he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass 
 my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you 
 cosette raised her head and replied 
 yes sir 
 give it to me said the man i will carry it for you 
 cosette let go of the the man walked along beside her 
 it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth then he added 
 how old are you little one 
 eight sir 
 and have you come from far like this 
 from the spring in the forest 
 are you going far 
 a good quarter of an walk from here 
 the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly 
 so you have no mother 
 i know answered the child 
 before the man had time to speak again she added 
 i think so 
 other people have mothers 
 i have none 
 and after a silence she went on 
 i think that i never had any 
 the man halted he set the bucket on the ground bent down and placed both hands on the shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark 
 thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky 
 what is your name said the man 
 cosette 
 the man seemed to have received an electric shock 
 he looked at her once more then he removed his hands from shoulders seized the bucket and set out again 
 after a moment he inquired 
 where do you live little one 
 at montfermeil if you know where that is 
 that is where we are going 
 yes sir 
 he paused then began again 
 who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest 
 it was madame thenardier 
 the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render indifferent but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor 
 what does your madame thenardier do 
 she is my mistress said the child 
 she keeps the inn 
 the inn said the man 
 well i am going to lodge there show me the way 
 we are on the way there said the child 
 the man walked tolerably fast 
 cosette followed him without difficulty she no longer felt any fatigue 
 from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence 
 she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven 
 several minutes elapsed 
 the man resumed 
 is there no servant in madame house 
 no sir 
 are you alone there 
 yes sir 
 another pause ensued 
 cosette lifted up her voice 
 that is to say there are two little girls 
 what little girls 
 ponine and zelma 
 this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier 
 who are ponine and zelma 
 they are madame young ladies her daughters as you would say 
 and what do those girls do 
 oh said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in them all full of affairs 
 they play they amuse themselves 
 all day long 
 yes sir 
 and you 
 i 
 i work 
 all day long 
 the child raised her great eyes in which hung a tear which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently 
 yes sir 
 after an interval of silence she went on 
 sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too 
 how do you amuse yourself 
 in the best way i can 
 they let me alone but i have not many playthings 
 ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls 
 i have only a little lead sword no longer than that 
 the child held up her tiny finger 
 and it will not cut 
 yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies 
 they reached the village 
 cosette guided the stranger through the streets 
 they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch 
 the man had ceased to ply her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence 
 when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the booths asked cosette 
 so there is a fair going on here 
 no sir it is christmas 
 as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm 
 monsieur 
 what my child 
 we are quite near the house 
 well 
 will you let me take my bucket now 
 why 
 if madame sees that some one has carried it for me she will beat me 
 the man handed her the bucket 
 an instant later they were at the tavern door

 book five 
 chapter xvii 
 
 in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who felt his absence very much having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov in hospital 
 the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about 
 the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard 
 directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant 
 i tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there 
 the assistant asked some further questions 
 oh do the best you can it all the same the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs 
 what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir 
 how so asked rostov 
 typhus sir death to go in only we two makeev and i he pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been invited here but our allies like it at all 
 rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who was wounded 
 i know i tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir and always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh he asked turning to the assistant 
 the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go 
 major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten 
 dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference 
 the assistant however did not confirm the words 
 is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor 
 rostov described appearance 
 there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one is dead i fancy however look up our list we had a list have you got it makeev 
 makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if step into the officers wards see for yourself he added turning to rostov 
 ah better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to stay here yourself 
 but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way 
 only blame me the doctor shouted up after him 
 rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats 
 may i go in and look 
 what is there to see said the assistant 
 but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in rostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it originated 
 in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at rostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy of health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drink drink a drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water 
 who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant 
 just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostov 
 good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities 
 get him to his place and give him some water said rostov pointing to the cossack 
 yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not move 
 no impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoat sat an old unshaven soldier as thin as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back 
 why this one seems he began turning to the assistant 
 and how been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw quivering been dead since morning after all men not dogs 
 send someone at once he shall be taken away taken away at once said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor 
 yes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his eyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room

 the unpleasantness of receiving into house a poor man who may be a rich man 
 cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the then she knocked the door opened 
 the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand 
 ah so you you little wretch good mercy but taken your time 
 the hussy has been amusing herself 
 madame said cosette trembling all over a gentleman who wants a lodging 
 the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to and eagerly sought the with her eyes 
 this is the gentleman said she 
 yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat 
 wealthy travellers are not so polite 
 this gesture and an inspection of the costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear 
 she resumed dryly 
 enter my good man 
 the good man entered 
 the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar 
 thereupon the thenardier exclaimed 
 ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left 
 put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room 
 forty sous 
 forty sous agreed 
 very well then 
 forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous 
 it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i lodge poor folks for less 
 true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it 
 in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass 
 the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting 
 the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention 
 cosette was ugly 
 if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six 
 her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping 
 the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people 
 her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains 
 the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent 
 as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter 
 all she had on was linen not a scrap of woollen 
 her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red 
 the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep 
 this whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole 
 fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase 
 in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked 
 her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again 
 the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon 
 as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church 
 have i the time said the thenardier 
 the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette 
 all at once the thenardier exclaimed 
 by the way that bread 
 cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table 
 she had completely forgotten the bread 
 she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied 
 madame the shop was shut 
 you should have knocked 
 i did knock madame 
 well 
 he did not open the door 
 find out whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my piece 
 cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the piece was not there 
 ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me 
 cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money 
 the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say 
 she was petrified 
 have you lost that piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it 
 at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the which hung on a nail in the 
 this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek 
 mercy madame madame 
 i will not do so any more 
 the thenardier took down the whip 
 in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything 
 cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor limbs 
 the thenardier raised her arm 
 pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little apron pocket and rolled aside 
 perhaps this is it 
 at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment 
 exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up 
 and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier 
 yes it said she 
 it was not it for it was a piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage 
 she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark let this ever happen again 
 cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it 
 by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller 
 he made no reply 
 he appeared to be absorbed in thought 
 what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth some frightfully poor wretch 
 he a sou to pay for a supper 
 will he even pay me for his lodging 
 very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor 
 in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered 
 they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye 
 they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement 
 there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced 
 light emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the throne 
 in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children 
 then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are 
 they went and seated themselves in the they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter 
 from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air 
 eponine and azelma did not look at cosette 
 she was the same as a dog to them 
 these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other 
 the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand 
 all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play 
 ah 
 caught you at it she cried 
 so the way you work make you work to the tune of the whip that i will 
 the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair 
 bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play 
 such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order 
 but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate 
 she retorted with acrimony 
 she must work since she eats 
 i feed her to do nothing 
 what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his shoulders 
 the thenardier deigned to reply 
 stockings if you please 
 stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now 
 the man looked at poor little red feet and continued 
 when will she have finished this pair of stockings 
 she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature 
 and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them 
 the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him 
 thirty sous at least 
 will you sell them for five francs went on the man 
 good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls 
 thenardier thought it time to strike in 
 yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs 
 we can refuse nothing to travellers 
 you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion 
 i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them 
 then he turned to cosette 
 now i own your work play my child 
 the carter was so much touched by the piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up 
 but true he cried examining it 
 a real hind wheel and not counterfeit 
 thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket 
 the thenardier had no reply to make 
 she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred 
 in the meantime cosette was trembling 
 she ventured to ask 
 is it true madame 
 may i play 
 play said the thenardier in a terrible voice 
 thanks madame said cosette 
 and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller 
 thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear 
 who can this yellow man be 
 i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner 
 cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette always moved as little as possible 
 she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her 
 eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat 
 they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps 
 while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast 
 you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm 
 see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl 
 i will be a lady 
 i will come to see you and you shall look at her 
 gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you 
 and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl 
 little girls are made like that just at present 
 azelma listened admiringly to eponine 
 in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook 
 thenardier accompanied and encouraged them 
 as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand 
 while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep 
 the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some lies the whole future 
 while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman 
 the first child is the continuation of the last doll 
 a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children 
 so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword 
 madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men 
 she came and set her elbows on the table 
 monsieur said she 
 at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme 
 you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous 
 you see she has nothing she must needs work 
 then this child is not yours demanded the man 
 oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child 
 she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see 
 we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead 
 ah said the man and fell into his revery once more 
 her mother amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child 
 during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there 
 meanwhile the drinkers all intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced 
 the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter 
 cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes 
 she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead 
 on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper 
 what does monsieur wish 
 bread and cheese said the man 
 decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier 
 the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers 
 all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table 
 then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room 
 madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it 
 an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness 
 no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper 
 this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour 
 but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly 
 that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister 
 the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll 
 eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt 
 let me alone said her mother what do you want 
 mother said the child look there 
 and she pointed to cosette 
 cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything 
 madame countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras 
 on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies 
 a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial blue ribbon would wear no other face 
 she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation 
 cosette 
 cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round 
 cosette repeated the thenardier 
 cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing 
 meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet 
 what is the matter he said to the thenardier 
 you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at feet 
 well what of it resumed the man 
 that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the doll 
 all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll 
 she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands 
 here cosette redoubled her sobs 
 will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier 
 the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out 
 as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries 
 the door opened again the man he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying 
 
 here this is for you 
 it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the 
 cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall 
 she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe 
 the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room 
 madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow 
 is he a poor man 
 is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief 
 the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force 
 the stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice 
 that machine costs at least thirty francs 
 no nonsense down on your belly before that man 
 gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state 
 well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women you going to take your doll 
 cosette ventured to emerge from her hole 
 the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air 
 take it it is yours 
 cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy 
 what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france 
 it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it 
 this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her 
 nevertheless the attraction carried the day 
 she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier 
 may i madame 
 no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic 
 pardi cried the thenardier it is yours 
 the gentleman has given it to you 
 truly sir said cosette 
 is it true 
 is the lady mine 
 the eyes seemed to be full of tears 
 he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep 
 he nodded to cosette and placed the hand in her tiny hand 
 cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor 
 we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport 
 i shall call her catherine she said 
 it was an odd moment when rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll 
 madame she resumed may i put her on a chair 
 yes my child replied the thenardier 
 it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy 
 cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation 
 play cosette said the stranger 
 oh 
 i am playing returned the child 
 this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment 
 however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure 
 she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms 
 from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud 
 old beast 
 what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner 
 to want that little monster to play to give away dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would 
 a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry 
 is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow 
 why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play 
 all right 
 a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it 
 if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you 
 if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has money 
 the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply 
 the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude 
 all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared 
 many hours passed 
 the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude 
 from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned 
 that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room 
 the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room 
 is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband going to bed 
 do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais 
 a good hour passed thus 
 the worthy had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the name 
 the stranger did not stir 
 thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair 
 not a movement on the part 
 is he asleep thought thenardier 
 the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him 
 at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say 
 is not monsieur going to his repose 
 not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect 
 these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day 
 a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs 
 well said the stranger you are right 
 where is your stable 
 sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir 
 he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico 
 what is this said the traveller 
 it is really our bridal chamber said the my wife and i occupy another 
 this is only entered three or four times a year 
 i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly 
 thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark 
 he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the a very good fire was flickering on the hearth 
 on the under a glass globe stood a in silver wire and orange flowers 
 and what is this resumed the stranger 
 that sir said thenardier is my wedding bonnet 
 the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden 
 thenardier lied however 
 when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house 
 when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning 
 the retired to his room 
 his wife was in bed but she was not asleep 
 when she heard her step she turned over and said to him 
 do you know going to turn cosette out of doors 
 thenardier replied coldly 
 how you do go on 
 they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished 
 as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner 
 the landlord once gone he threw himself into an and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase 
 there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet 
 no sheets this was placed on the floor 
 in this bed cosette was sleeping 
 the man approached and gazed down upon her 
 cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed 
 in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold 
 against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark 
 from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms 
 beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes 
 a door which stood open near pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room 
 the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds 
 they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep 
 the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair 
 he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at 
 there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the gaze nevertheless 
 it was two tiny shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size 
 the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth 
 the traveller bent over them 
 the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a and shining piece 
 the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object 
 he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud 
 it was sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the also 
 hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing 
 there was nothing in this wooden shoe 
 the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis in shoe 
 then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf

 book five 
 chapter xviii 
 
 going along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officers wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open there were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns the first person rostov met in the officers ward was a thin little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth rostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before 
 see where met again said the little man tushin tushin you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and had a bit cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov my neighbor he added when he heard who rostov wanted here here and tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several laughing voices 
 how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back 
 denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it was nearly noon 
 ah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the same voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of face and the intonations of his voice 
 his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostov what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about the general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters did not listen 
 rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside gradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little tushin still listened shaking his head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted denisov 
 but what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted 
 me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i would ask mercy but being for bwinging wobbers to book let them twy me not afwaid of anyone served the tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded listen to them stwaight this is what i say if i had wobbed the tweasuwy 
 certainly well written said tushin but not the point vasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov one has to submit and vasili dmitrich want to you know the auditor told you it was a bad business 
 well let it be bad said denisov 
 the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he indicating rostov has connections on the staff you find a better opportunity 
 i said not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went on reading his paper 
 rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper 
 when the reading of virulent reply which took more than an hour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid hospital comrades who had round him telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening 
 late in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him 
 yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he had an inkpot and sat down to write 
 it seems no use knocking head against a wall he said coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply asked for pardon 
 hand it in it seems 
 he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter ix 
 
 thenardier and his manoeuvres 
 on the following morning two hours at least before thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern pen in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat 
 his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes 
 they exchanged not a word 
 on the one hand there was profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind 
 a noise was audible in the house it was the lark sweeping the stairs 
 after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures thenardier produced the following masterpiece 
 bill of the gentleman in no 
 supper francs 
 chamber 
 candle 
 fire 
 service 
 total francs 
 service was written servisse 
 francs cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation 
 like all great artists thenardier was dissatisfied 
 peuh he exclaimed 
 it was the accent of castlereagh auditing bill at the congress of vienna 
 monsieur thenardier you are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters 
 it is just but it is too much he will not pay it 
 thenardier laughed coldly as usual and said 
 he will pay 
 this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so 
 his wife did not insist 
 she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment later he added 
 i owe full fifteen hundred francs 
 he went and seated himself in the meditating with his feet among the warm ashes 
 ah by the way resumed his wife you forget that going to turn cosette out of doors the monster 
 she breaks my heart with that doll of hers 
 rather marry louis xviii than keep her another day in the house 
 thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs 
 you will hand that bill to the man 
 then he went out 
 hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered 
 thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the door visible only to his wife 
 the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand 
 up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already 
 as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples 
 to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her 
 the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and he replied 
 yes madame i am going 
 so monsieur has no business in montfermeil 
 no i was passing through 
 that is all 
 what do i owe you madame he added 
 the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill 
 the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere 
 madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil 
 so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion 
 she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone 
 oh 
 monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood 
 all the people are poor you see 
 if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all 
 we have so many expenses 
 just see that child is costing us our very eyes 
 what child 
 why the little one you know 
 lark as she is called hereabouts 
 ah said the man 
 she went on 
 how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames 
 she has more the air of a bat than of a lark 
 you see sir we do not ask charity and we cannot bestow it 
 we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal 
 the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths 
 monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money 
 and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other children 
 the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor 
 what if one were to rid you of her 
 who 
 cosette 
 yes 
 the red and violent face brightened up hideously 
 ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you 
 agreed 
 really 
 you will take her away 
 i will take her away 
 immediately 
 immediately 
 call the child 
 cosette screamed the thenardier 
 in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how much is it 
 he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise 
 francs 
 he looked at the landlady and repeated 
 francs 
 there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point 
 the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she replied with assurance 
 good gracious yes sir it is francs 
 the stranger laid five pieces on the table 
 go and get the child said he 
 at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said 
 monsieur owes sous 
 sous exclaimed his wife 
 twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper 
 as for the child i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman 
 leave us wife 
 madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent 
 she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room 
 as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of and simplicity 
 sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child 
 the stranger gazed intently at him 
 what child 
 thenardier continued 
 how strange it is one grows attached 
 what money is that take back your piece 
 i adore the child 
 whom do you mean demanded the stranger 
 eh our little cosette 
 are you not intending to take her away from us 
 well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it 
 i shall miss that child 
 i saw her first when she was a tiny thing 
 it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses 
 but one must do something for the good sake 
 she has neither father nor mother i have brought her up 
 i have bread enough for her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child 
 you understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is but she loves her also 
 you see she is just the same as our own child 
 i want to keep her to babble about the house 
 the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter continued 
 excuse me sir but one does not give away child to a like that 
 i am right am i not 
 still i say you are rich you have the air of a very good it were for her happiness 
 but one must find out that 
 you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good is alive that he is watching over her in short there are things which are not possible 
 i do not even know your name 
 if you were to take her away i should say well and the lark what has become of her 
 one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know 
 the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice 
 monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris 
 if i take cosette away i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter 
 you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives 
 i break the thread which binds her foot and she departs 
 does that suit you 
 yes or no 
 since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person 
 it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude 
 while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing 
 not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow had escaped him even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose 
 he had caught the old deep glances returning constantly to the child who was this man 
 why this interest 
 why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse 
 questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he had pondered it all night long 
 he could not be father was he her grandfather 
 then why not make himself known at once when one has a right one asserts it 
 this man evidently had no right over cosette 
 what was it then 
 thenardier lost himself in conjectures 
 he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak 
 he had expected nothing of the sort 
 his conjectures were put to the rout 
 he rallied his ideas 
 he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that 
 he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries 
 sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs 
 the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three which he laid on the table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the 
 go and fetch cosette 
 while this was taking place what had cosette been doing 
 on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe 
 in it she had found the gold piece 
 it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled 
 her destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear she was happy above all she was stupefied 
 such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real 
 the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her 
 she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence 
 the stranger alone did not frighten her on the contrary he reassured her 
 ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind 
 everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take refuge under a shadow and under a wing 
 for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed 
 formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm 
 cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier 
 she was no longer alone there was some one there 
 she hastily set about her regular morning duties 
 that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told 
 as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket 
 it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her 
 she had gone in search of cosette at her orders 
 what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her 
 cosette she said almost gently come immediately 
 an instant later cosette entered the public room 
 the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings complete outfit for a girl of seven years 
 all was black 
 my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly 
 daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris 
 they were going in the direction of livry 
 it was our man and cosette 
 no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not recognize her 
 cosette was going away 
 with whom 
 she did not know 
 whither 
 she knew not 
 all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her 
 no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one 
 she was leaving that hated and hating house 
 poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour 
 cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky 
 she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron 
 from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man 
 she felt something as though she were beside the good god

 book five 
 chapter xix 
 
 having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor 
 on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at tilsit 
 i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte 
 you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling 
 boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested 
 i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general patted him on the shoulder with a smile 
 you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him 
 boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting arrival saw both emperors get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts he felt to be of historic importance as the suite was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the latter knew his face and all those at court far from him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been surprised had he been absent 
 boris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski zhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fond of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with him and boris 
 on the evening of the of june count zhilinski arranged a supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an of there were also several french officers of the guard and a page of a young lad of an old aristocratic french family that same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by boris and zhilinski 
 rostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the french who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had taken place at headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear only recently talking with one of cossack officers rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in boris lodging dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there boris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing rostov 
 ah you very glad very glad to see you he said however coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first impulse 
 come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have business he said coldly 
 no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dans un moment je suis a vous he said answering someone who called him 
 in a minute i shall be at your disposal 
 i see intruding rostov repeated 
 the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face having evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking serenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostov 
 oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said boris and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of his 
 count zhilinski le comte n n le capitaine s s said he naming his guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed reluctantly and remained silent 
 zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor 
 no i came on business replied rostov briefly 
 rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in a bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in way he really was in their way for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general the looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting here for he rose and went up to boris 
 anyhow in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over my business and go away 
 oh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come and lie down in my room and have a rest 
 yes really 
 they went into the little room where boris slept rostov without sitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame in some way telling him about affair asking him whether through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on behalf and get petition handed in when he and boris were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes 
 i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general i think 
 so you want to do anything well then say so rostov almost shouted not looking boris in the face 
 boris smiled 
 on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought 
 at that moment voice was heard calling boris 
 well then go go go said rostov and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter x 
 
 he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse 
 madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont 
 she had expected great results 
 when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs 
 is that all said she 
 it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the acts 
 the blow told 
 you are right in sooth said he i am a fool 
 give me my hat 
 he folded up the three thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while 
 that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness 
 he would have given fifteen thousand francs 
 but i shall overtake him 
 and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it one does not let mysteries out of hand when one has once grasped them 
 the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold one must know how to subject them to pressure 
 all these thoughts whirled through his brain 
 i am an animal said he 
 when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau 
 on arriving there he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child 
 he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time 
 some informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny 
 he hastened in that direction 
 they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country 
 all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps 
 i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself 
 thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them 
 it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged 
 in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard 
 he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster 
 satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen in the presence of this hideous masterpiece 
 after a momentary hesitation 
 bah he thought they will have time to make their escape 
 and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges 
 in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that hat 
 the brushwood was not high 
 thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there 
 the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible 
 thenardier was not mistaken 
 the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat rested 
 the walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of 
 pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs 
 so saying he handed the stranger the three 
 the man raised his eyes 
 what is the meaning of this 
 thenardier replied respectfully 
 
 it means sir that i shall take back cosette 
 cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man 
 he replied gazing to the very bottom of eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly 
 you are to take back 
 yes sir i am 
 i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you 
 i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother 
 you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear 
 the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the of make its appearance once more 
 the shivered with joy 
 good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me 
 before opening the the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley 
 the man opened his once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the saying 
 you are right read 
 thenardier took the paper and read 
 m sur m march 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 you know that signature resumed the man 
 it certainly was signature thenardier recognized it 
 there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten the man added 
 you may keep this paper as your receipt 
 thenardier retreated in tolerably good order 
 this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go 
 then he essayed a desperate effort 
 it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things 
 a great deal is owing to me 
 the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his sleeve 
 monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs 
 in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and francs you had received one hundred francs too much that makes still owing you 
 i have just given you fifteen hundred francs 
 sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap 
 who is this devil of a man he thought 
 he did what the wolf does 
 he shook himself 
 audacity had succeeded with him once 
 he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns 
 the stranger said tranquilly 
 come cosette 
 he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground 
 thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot 
 the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the motionless and speechless 
 while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists 
 then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands 
 i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting 
 however the did not give up 
 i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance 
 two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs 
 the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness 
 the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed 
 all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves 
 the deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace 
 the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round 
 it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course 
 the set out again in pursuit thus they continued for two or three hundred paces 
 all at once the man turned round once more he saw the this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further 
 thenardier retraced his steps

 rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet 
 rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets with hugh monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 
 boris want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged 
 saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 
 i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house 
 no i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the house 
 a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the lower floor 
 whom do you want someone inquired 
 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice 
 a petition this way to the officer the officer on duty he was shown the door leading downstairs only it be accepted 
 on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov entered 
 a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome braces that for some reason attracted attention this man was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room 
 a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing rostov he stopped short and frowned 
 what is it a petition 
 what is it asked the person in the other room 
 another petitioner answered the man with the braces 
 tell him to come later be coming out directly we must go 
 later later tomorrow too late 
 rostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped him 
 whom have you come from who are you 
 i come from major denisov answered rostov 
 are you an officer 
 lieutenant count rostov 
 what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him 
 rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass 
 cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him 
 what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice 
 it was a cavalry general who had obtained the special favor during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving 
 rostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the general knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his head gravely 
 sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter 
 hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the gentlemen of the suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in soul in all its old force in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regiment white breeches and high boots and wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legion the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of division smiled and beckoned to him 
 all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor 
 the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all 
 i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised his foot to the stirrup 
 the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov ran after him with the crowd

 number reappears and cosette wins it in the lottery 
 jean valjean was not dead 
 when he fell into the sea or rather when he threw himself into it he was not ironed as we have seen 
 he swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor to which a boat was moored he found means of hiding himself in this boat until night at night he swam off again and reached the shore a little way from cape brun 
 there as he did not lack money he procured clothing a small in the neighborhood of balaguier was at that time the of escaped lucrative specialty then jean valjean like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary 
 he found his first refuge at pradeaux near beausset 
 then he directed his course towards near briancon in the it was a fumbling and uneasy flight a track whose branchings are untraceable 
 later on some trace of his passage into ain in the territory of civrieux was discovered in the pyrenees at accons at the spot called near the market of chavailles and in the environs of perigueux at brunies canton of la he reached paris we have just seen him at montfermeil 
 his first care on arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age then to procure a lodging 
 that done he had betaken himself to montfermeil it will be remembered that already during his preceding escape he had made a mysterious trip thither or somewhere in that neighborhood of which the law had gathered an inkling 
 however he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him 
 at paris one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands he felt reassured and almost at peace as though he had really been dead 
 on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the claws of the thenardiers he returned to paris 
 he it at nightfall with the child by way of the barrier monceaux there he entered a cabriolet which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire 
 there he got out paid the coachman took cosette by the hand and together they directed their steps through the the deserted streets which adjoin the ourcine and the glaciere towards the boulevard de 
 the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette they had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns behind hedges they had changed carriages frequently they had travelled short distances on foot 
 she made no complaint but she was weary and jean valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked 
 he took her on his back cosette without letting go of catherine laid her head on jean shoulder and there fell asleep

 book five 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 
 as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him 
 in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him 
 alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he might be recognized 
 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
 this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly 
 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor 
 will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the battalion 
 bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand tore it in doing so and threw it away an behind him rushed forward and picked it up 
 to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in russian in a low voice 
 to whomever your majesty commands 
 the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back remarked 
 but we must give him an answer 
 kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in his scrutiny 
 can it be me thought rostov 
 lazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the first soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward 
 where are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who did not know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks 
 napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another and a page the same one rostov had seen the previous evening at boris ran forward and bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them then he approached lazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the order touched one of buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the cross on breast and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and it really did 
 officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing motionless presenting arms looked again straight into eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid position 
 the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them 
 lazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostov 
 what think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was saying have you seen lazarev 
 i have 
 tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner 
 yes but what luck for lazarev twelve hundred francs pension for life 
 a cap lads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy french cap 
 a fine thing 
 have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must respond in kind 
 boris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk banquet on his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house 
 rostov how do we missed one another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and troubled was face 
 nothing nothing replied rostov 
 call round 
 yes i will 
 rostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a distance a distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he remembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened 
 the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he found so many people among them officers who like himself had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting with wrath and therefore much to the surprise of the officers 
 how can you judge best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to his face how can you judge the actions what right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the or his actions 
 but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand outburst except on the supposition that he was drunk 
 but rostov did not listen to him 
 we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on if we are ordered to die we must die if punished it means that we have deserved it not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left that way we shall be saying there is no god nothing shouted nicholas banging the table very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts 
 our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think all said he 
 and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel 
 yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottle he shouted 
 in the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter i 
 
 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then 
 it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery 
 it was the old quarter of the 
 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled 
 take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur nor to uphold it with authority 
 leaving aside this place which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even is so unattractive where stood the building number 
 bourgeois houses only began to spring up there years later the place was unpleasant 
 in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose dome could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men 
 as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerecloths new white walls like everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness of right angles 
 not an unevenness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture not a fold the ensemble was glacial regular hideous 
 nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry 
 it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief 
 despair yawns something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored 
 if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard de might have formed the entrance to it 
 nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful 
 the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite the cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it 
 one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister 
 in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old women were fond of begging 
 however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation 
 even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses crumble and new ones rise 
 since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets 
 the symptoms of a new life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians 
 one memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de and that paris had entered the suburb of

 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled 
 take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur nor to uphold it with authority 
 leaving aside this place which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even is so unattractive where stood the building number 
 bourgeois houses only began to spring up there years later the place was unpleasant 
 in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose dome could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men 
 as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerecloths new white walls like everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness of right angles 
 not an unevenness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture not a fold the ensemble was glacial regular hideous 
 nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry 
 it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief 
 despair yawns something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored 
 if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard de might have formed the entrance to it 
 nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful 
 the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite the cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it 
 one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister 
 in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old women were fond of begging 
 however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation 
 even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses crumble and new ones rise 
 since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets 
 the symptoms of a new life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians 
 one memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de and that paris had entered the suburb of

 a nest for owl and a warbler 
 it was in front of this gorbeau house that jean valjean halted like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest 
 he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out a sort of a opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette 
 at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door 
 the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor a table and several chairs a stove in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner 
 a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room at the extreme end there was a with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her 
 he struck a match and lighted a candle 
 all this was prepared beforehand on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration 
 the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was 
 jean valjean bent down and kissed that hand 
 nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep 
 the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart 
 he knelt beside bed 
 lt was broad daylight and the child still slept 
 a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade 
 all at once a heavily laden cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the frail bed like a clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom 
 yes madame cried cosette waking with a start here i am here i am 
 and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall 
 ah mon dieu my broom said she 
 she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean 
 ah so it is true said the child 
 good morning monsieur 
 children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature joy and happiness 
 cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean 
 where was she 
 was paris very large was madame thenardier very far away 
 was she to go back etc etc all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here 
 it was a frightful hole but she felt free 
 must i sweep she resumed at last 
 play said jean valjean 
 the day passed thus 
 cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man

 prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country 
 all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty 
 he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going 
 on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of the kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs 
 prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs 
 besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations 
 in the spring of he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son whose guardian he was 
 warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of anything but looked and cheerfully from side to side 
 they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless and flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last leaves the coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly 
 peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented but apparently the sympathy was not enough for peter and he turned on the box toward his master 
 how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile 
 what 
 pleasant your excellency 
 what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak 
 at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine 
 spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies 
 as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak too were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid misshapen and grim as ever 
 yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew let others the young yield afresh to that fraud but we know life our life is finished 
 a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not disturbing himself or desiring anything

 chapter iii 
 
 two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune 
 on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake 
 some new thing had come into his soul 
 jean valjean had never loved anything for years he had been alone in the world 
 he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy 
 the heart of that was full of virginity his sister and his children had left him only a vague and memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them 
 human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss 
 when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him 
 all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child 
 he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy 
 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing 
 poor old man with a perfectly new heart 
 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light 
 it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise 
 the early days passed in this dazzled state 
 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing 
 she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her 
 like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded 
 all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children 
 she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her 
 it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility 
 thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man 
 she felt that which she had never felt sensation of expansion 
 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty 
 these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy 
 the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here 
 nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret 
 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other 
 instinct sought a father as jean instinct sought a child 
 to meet was to find each other 
 at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together 
 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely 
 taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become father after a celestial fashion 
 and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god 
 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well 
 there he seemed perfectly secure 
 the chamber with a which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard 
 this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side 
 the of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a for and no communication existed between it and the first story 
 it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were 
 the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited 
 it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve 
 he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival 
 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel 
 cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak 
 children have their morning song as well as birds 
 it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it 
 the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion 
 at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning 
 she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life 
 jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read 
 sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison 
 this idea had ended in teaching a child to read 
 then the smiled with the pensive smile of the angels 
 he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery 
 good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones 
 to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean existence 
 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray 
 she called him father and knew no other name for him 
 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle 
 life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light 
 the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts 
 at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly 
 this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert 
 he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim 
 who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more he loved and grew strong again 
 alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette 
 he protected her and she strengthened him thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue 
 he was that stay and she was his prop 
 oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny

 prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him 
 it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe 
 prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 
 suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 
 in count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying the night 
 during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so glad 
 that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the stupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed 
 he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky 
 his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead 
 just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once 
 but when are you coming to bed replied another voice 
 i i sleep the use come now for the last time 
 two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song 
 oh how lovely now go to sleep and an end of it 
 you go to sleep but i said the first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence 
 sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was such a lovely night before 
 sonya made some reluctant reply 
 do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight as tight as possible and flying away like this 
 take care fall out 
 he heard the sound of a scuffle and disapproving voice past one 
 oh you only spoil things for me all right go go 
 again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh 
 o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then if it must be and she slammed the casement 
 for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him there she is again as if it were on purpose thought he 
 in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once

 the remarks of the principal tenant 
 jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to which is the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the delight was to go out with the good man 
 she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her 
 it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person 
 the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market 
 they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances 
 jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to replaced by a solid door 
 he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat in the street he was taken for a poor man 
 it sometimes happened that women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow 
 it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages 
 he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms 
 the old principal lodger a creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact 
 she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative 
 there remained to her from her past two above the other she was continually knocking against each other 
 she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil 
 one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him 
 jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt 
 the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a for a thousand francs 
 it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence 
 she fled in alarm 
 a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought the old woman 
 he did not go out until six in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour 
 the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises 
 that note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes 
 a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his in the corridor 
 the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order 
 she was alone 
 cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed 
 the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail and examined it 
 the lining had been sewed up again 
 the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper more no doubt 
 she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big a very large knife suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors 
 each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents 
 thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter

 next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home 
 it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots 
 the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away 
 yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy foliage stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the hard bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced 
 yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind 
 no life is not over at prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony 
 on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 
 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas go out today very cold 
 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up

 of love 
 the stage is more beholding to love than the life of man for as to the stage love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies but in life it doth much mischief sometimes like a siren sometimes like a fury you may observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons whereof the memory remaineth either ancient or recent there is not one that hath been transported to the mad degree of love which shows that great spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion 
 you must except nevertheless marcus antonius the half partner of the empire of rome and appius claudius the decemvir and lawgiver whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man and inordinate but the latter was an austere and wise man and therefore it seems though rarely that love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified if watch be not well kept it is a poor saying of epicurus satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus as if man made for the contemplation of heaven and all noble objects should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself subject though not of the mouth as beasts are yet of the eye which was given him for higher purposes it is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion and how it braves the nature and value of things by this that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love neither is it merely in the phrase for whereas it hath been well said that the with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence is a self certainly the lover is more for there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself as the lover doth of me person loved and therefore it was well said mat it is impossible to love and to be wise neither doth his weakness appear to others only and not to the party loved but to the loved most of all except the love be reciproque 
 
 for it is a true rule that love is ever rewarded either with the reciproque or 
 with an inward and secret contempt by how much the more men ought to beware of this passion which loseth not only other things but itself as for the other losses the relation doth well figure them that he that preferred helena quitted the gifts of juno and pallas for whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection quitteth both riches and wisdom this passion hath his floods in the very times of weakness which are great prosperity and great adversity though this latter hath been less observed both which times kindle love and make it more fervent and therefore show it to be the child of folly they do best who if they cannot but admit love yet make it keep quarter 
 and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and actions of life for if it check 
 once with business it troubleth men s fortunes and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own ends i know not how but martial men are given to love i think it is but as they are given to wine for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures there is in nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of others which if it be not spent upon some one or a few doth naturally spread itself towards many and maketh men become humane and charitable as it is seen sometime in friars nuptial love maketh mankind friendly love perfecteth it but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it

 book just man 
 chapter ix 
 
 the brother as depicted by the sister 
 in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the friend of her childhood 
 this letter is in our possession 
 d dec my good madam 
 not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours 
 madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath 
 my which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers 
 but my room is the one you ought to see 
 madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable 
 the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me 
 in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night 
 what shall i say to you 
 i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum 
 she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden of ancient fashion they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany 
 i am always very happy 
 my brother is so good 
 he gives all he has to the poor and sick 
 we are very much cramped 
 the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need 
 we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed you see that these are great treats 
 my brother has ways of his own 
 when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so 
 just imagine the door of our house is never fastened whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my room he fears nothing even at night 
 that is his sort of bravery he says 
 he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it 
 one must know how to understand him 
 he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters nor night 
 last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers 
 he would not take us 
 he was absent for a fortnight 
 on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed 
 and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him 
 when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me 
 at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible 
 now i have ended by getting used to it i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him he risks himself as he sees fit 
 i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep 
 i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me 
 i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop 
 it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences 
 but now the habit has been acquired 
 we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep 
 if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so 
 after all what is there for us to fear in this house 
 there is always some one with us who is stronger than we 
 the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here 
 this suffices me 
 my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me 
 i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence 
 that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul 
 i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family 
 you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist 
 they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen 
 five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux a jean de faux and a thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort the last was and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne 
 his daughter married de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and of the army 
 it is written faux fauq and faoucq 
 good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal 
 as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me 
 she is well works as you would wish and loves me 
 that is all that i desire 
 the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy 
 my health is not so very bad and yet i grow thinner every day 
 farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you 
 a thousand good wishes 
 baptistine 
 your grand nephew is charming 
 do you know that he will soon be five years old 
 yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on and he said what has he got on his knees he is a charming child 
 his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hu 
 as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould themselves to the ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself the bishop of d in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact they trembled but they let him alone 
 sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon 
 at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house 
 they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain cares may be put under constraint 
 thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him they confided him to god 
 moreover baptistine said as we have just read that her end would prove her own 
 madame magloire did not say this but she knew it

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways 
 a comlink buzzed softly for attention yes tarkin acknowledged 
 we have an emergency alert in detention block aa 
 the princess tarkin yelped jumping to his feet vader whirled trying tostare through the walls 
 i know is here i knew i could not mistake a stirring in the forceof such power 
 put all sections on alert tarkin ordered through the comlink then he turnedto stare at vader if right he must not be allowed to escape 
 escape may not be intention vader replied struggling tocontrol his emotions he is the last of the the greatest the danger hepresents to us must not be only i can deal with him his headsnapped around to stare fixedly at tarkin alone 
 luke and leia had started back up the corridor when a series of blindingexplosion ripped the walkway ahead of them several troopers had tried comingthrough the elevator only to be crisped one after another by chewbacca disdainingthe elevators they had blasted a gaping hole through a wall the opening was toolarge for solo and the wookie to cover completely in twos and threes the imperialswere working their way into the detention block 
 retreating down the walkway han and chewbacca encountered luke and theprincess we go back that way solo told them his face flushed withexcitement and worry 
 no it looks like managed to cut off our only escape route leia agreedreadily this is a detention area you know they build them with multipleexits 
 breathing heavily solo turned to look her up and down begging yourforgiveness your highness he said sarcastically but maybe prefer it back inyour cell she looked away her face impassive 
 got to be another way out luke muttered pulling a small transmitterunit from his belt and carefully adjusting the frequency see threepioseethreepio 
 a familiar voice responded with gratifying speed yes sir 
 been cut off here are there any other ways out of the detention at all 
 static crackled over the tiny grid as solo and chewbacca kept the imperial troopsbottled up at the other end of the walkway 
 what was that i copy 
 back in the gentry office artoo detoo beeped and whistled frantically asthreepio adjusted controls fighting to clear the awkward transmission i said allsystems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entry seems to be the onlyway in or out of the cell block he pressed instruments and the view on the nearbyreadouts changed steadily all other information on your section is restricted 
 someone began banging on the locked door to the at first andthen when no response was forthcoming from within more insistently 
 oh no threepio groaned 
 the smoke in the cell corridor was now so intense that it was difficult for soloand chewbacca to pick their targets that was fortunate inasmuch as they were nowbadly outnumbered and the smoke confused the imperials fire with equalthoroughness 
 every so often one of the soldiers would attempt to move closer only to standexposed as he penetrated the smoke under the accurate fire of the two would rapidly join the accumulating mass of motionless figures on the rampwayflooring 
 energy bolts continued to ricochet wildly through the block as luke moved closeto solo 
 there other way out he yelled over the deafening roar of concentratedfire 
 well closing in on us what do we do now 
 this is some rescue an irritated voice complained from behind them bothmen turned to see a thoroughly disgusted princess eyeing them with regal you came in here you have a plan of getting out 
 solo nodded toward luke the brains sweetheart 
 luke managed an embarrassed grin and shrugged helplessly he turned to helpreturn fire but before he could do so the princess had snatched the pistol from hishand 
 hey 
 luke stared as she moved along the wall finally locating a small grate pointed the pistol at it and fired 
 solo gazed at her in disbelief what do you think doing 
 it looks like up to me to save our skins get into the garbage 
 while the others looked on in amazement she jumped feet first into the openingand disappeared chewbacca rumbled threateningly but solo slowly shook his head 
 no chewie i want you to rip her apart not sure about her beginning to like her or going to kill her myself the wookiesnorted something else and solo yelled back at him go on in you furry oaf care what you smell this is no time to go dainty on me 
 shoving the reluctant wookie toward the tiny opening solo helped jam themassive bulk through as soon as he disappeared the corellian followed him fired off the last series of blasts more in the hope of creating a covering smokethan hitting anything slid into the chute and was gone 
 not wanting to incur further losses in such a confined space the pursuingsoldiers had momentarily halted to await the arrival of reinforcements and heavierweapons besides they had their quarry trapped and despite their dedication noneof them were anxious to die needlessly 
 the chamber luke tumbled into was dimly lit not that the light was needed todiscern its contents he smelled the decay long before he was dumped into except for the concealed illuminants the garbage room was at least aquarter full of slimy muck much of which had already achieved a state ofdecomposition sufficient to wrinkle nose 
 solo was stumbling around the edge of the room slipping and sinking up to hisknees in the uncertain footing in an attempt to locate an exit al he found was asmall thick hatchway which he grunted and heaved to pry open the hatchcoverrefused to budge 
 the garbage chute was a wonderful idea he told the princess the sweat from his forehead what an incredible smell we ride out here on a drifting odor and there seem to beany other exit unless i can get this hatch open 
 stepping back he pulled his pistol and fired at the cover the bolt promptlywent howling around the room as everyone sought cover in the garbage a lastglance and the bolt detonated almost on top of them 
 looking less dignified by the moment leia was the first to emerge from thepungent cover put that thing away she told solo grimly or going to getus all killed 
 yes your worship solo muttered in snide supplication he made no moveto reholster his weapon as he glanced back up toward the open chute above take long for them to figure out what happened to us we had things wellunder you led us down here 
 sure you did she shot back brushing refuse from her hair and well it could be worse 
 as if in reply a piercing horrible moaning filled the room it seemed to comefrom somewhere beneath them chewbacca let out a terrified yowl of his own andtried to flatten himself against a wall luke drew his own pistol and peered hard atvarious clumps of debris but saw nothing 
 what was that solo asked 
 not too sure luke suddenly jumped looking down and behind just moved past me i think watch out 
 with shocking suddenness luke disappeared straight down into the garbage 
 got luke the princess shouted it took him under solo lookedaround frantically for something to shoot at 
 as abruptly as he had vanished luke so did part of somethingelse a thick whitish tentacle was wrapped tight around his throat 
 shoot it kill it luke screamed 
 shoot it i even see it solo protested 
 once again luke was sucked under by whatever that gruesome appendage wasattached to solo stared helplessly around the multicolored surface 
 there was a distant rumble of heavy machinery and two opposing walls of thechamber moved inward several centimeters the rumble ceased and then it wasquiet again luke appeared unexpectedly close to solo scrabbling his way clear ofthe suffocating mess and rubbing at the welt on his neck 
 what happened to it leia wondered eyeing the quiescent garbage warily 
 luke looked genuinely puzzled i know it had then i wasfree it just let me go and disappeared maybe i smell bad enough for it 
 got a very bad feeling about this solo murmured 
 again the distant rumble filled the room again the walls began their inwardmarch only this time neither sound nor movement showed any sign of stopping 
 just stand there gaping at each other the princess urged them try tobrace them with something 
 even with the thick poles and old metal beams chewbacca could handle theywere unable to find anything capable of slowing the walls advance it seemed as ifthe stronger the object was that they placed against the walls the easier it wassnapped luke pulled out his comlink simultaneously trying to talk and will thewalls to retreat threepiocome in threepio a decent paused produced noresponse causing luke to look worriedly at his companions 
 i know why he answer he tried again see threepio comein do you read 
 see threepio the muted voice continued to call come in see threepio itwas voice and it issued softly in between buzzings from the small handcomlink resting on the deserted computer console save for the intermittent gantry office was silent 
 a tremendous explosion drowned out the muffled pleadings it blew the officedoor clean across the room sending metal fragments flying in all directions severalof them struck the comlink sending it flying to the floor and cutting off voicein midtransmission 
 in the wake of the minor cataclysm four armed and ready troopers enteredthrough the blown portal initial study indicated the office was adim frightened voice was heard coming from one of the tall supply cabinets near theback of the room 
 help help let us out 
 several of the troopers bent to inspect the immobile bodies of the gantry officerand his aide while others opened the noisy cabinet two robots one tall andhumanoid the other purely mechanical and stepped out into the taller one gave the impression of being half unbalanced with fear 
 madmen i tell you madmen he gestured urgently toward thedoorway i think they said something about heading for the prison level theyjust left if you hurry you might catch them that way that way 
 two of the troopers inside joined those waiting in the hallway in hustling offdown the corridor that left two guards to watch over the office they totallyignored the robots as they discussed what might have taken place 
 all the excitement has overloaded the circuitry in my companion explained carefully if you mind like to take him down tomaintenance 
 hmmm one of the guards looked up indifferently and nodded to the and artoo hurried out the door without looking back as they departed itoccurred to the guard that the taller of the two droids was of a type he had never seenbefore he shrugged that was not surprising on a station of this size 
 that was too close threepio muttered as they scurried down an emptycorridor now have to find another console and plug youback in or everything is lost 
 the garbage chamber grew remorselessly smaller the smoothly fitting metalwalls moving toward one another with stolid precision larger pieces of refuseperformed a concerto of snapping and popping that was rising toward a finalshuddering crescendo 
 chewbacca whined pitifully as he fought with all his incredible strength andweight to hold back one of the walls looking like a hirsute tantalus approaching hisfinal summit 
 one for sure solo noted unhappily all going to be muchthinner this could prove popular for slimming the only trouble is itspermanence 
 luke paused for breath shaking the innocent comlink angrily what couldhave happened to threepio 
 try the hatch again advised leia our only hope 
 solo shielded his eyes and did so the ineffectual blast echoed mockinglythrough the narrowing chamber 
 the service bay was unoccupied everyone apparently having been drawn awayby the commotion elsewhere after a cautious survey of the room threepiobeckoned for artoo to follow together they commenced a hurried search of themany service panels artoo let out a beep and threepio rushed to him he waitedimpatiently as the smaller unit plugged the receptive arm carefully into the opensocket 
 a superfast flurry of electronics spewed in undisciplined fashion from the grid ofthe little droid threepio made cautioning motions 
 wait a minute slow down the sounds dropped to a crawl where they what oh no only come out of there as liquid 
 less than a meter of life was left to the trapped occupants of the garbage and solo had been forced to turn sideways had ended up facing each other forthe first time the haughtiness was gone from the face reaching out shetook hand clutching it convulsively as she felt the first touch of the closingwalls 
 luke had fallen and was lying on his side fighting to keep his head above therising ooze he nearly choked on a mouthful of compressed sludge when hiscomlink began buzzing for attention 
 threepio 
 are you there sir the droid replied had some minor would not believe 
 shut up threepio luke screamed into the unit and shut down all therefuse units on the detention level or immediately below it do you copy shutdown the refuse 
 moments later threepio grabbed at his head in pain as a terrific screeching andyelling sounded over the comlink 
 no shut them all down he implored artoo hurry oh listen to dying artoo i curse this metal body of mine i was not fast enough itwas my fault my poor of themno no no 
 the screaming and yelling however continued far beyond what seemed like areasonable interval in fact they were shouts of relief the chamber walls hadreversed direction automatically with shutdown and were moving apart again 
 artoo threepio luke hollered into the comlink all right all you read me did just fine 
 brushing distastefully at the clinging slime he made his way as rapidly aspossible toward the hatchcover bending he scraped accumulated detritus the number thus revealing 
 open the hatch on unit 
 yes sir came acknowledgment 
 they may have been the happiest words luke had ever heard

 chapter x 
 
 prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception made and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment to staff despite all anna endeavors and entreaties soon after anna reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations the rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town and where and where her darling bory who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to radzivilov 
 it was st day and the name day of two of the rostovs the mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly ever since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the countess big house on the povarskaya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the with the visitors who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays 
 the countess was a woman of about with a thin oriental type of face evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw them off inviting them all to dinner 
 i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chere he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chere on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same expression on his full cheerful face the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he would call dmitri vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say well dmitri see that things are all as they should be right the great thing is the serving it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room 
 marya lvovna karagina and her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her portrait on it 
 quite worn out by these callers however see her and no more she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying very well finish me off 
 a tall stout and woman with a smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling 
 dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child at the ball and countess apraksina i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i am so delighted health and countess apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of day count bezukhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at anna reception 
 i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him 
 what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of count distress some fifteen times 
 what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police 
 you say so replied the countess 
 he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince son he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and son sent back to moscow anatole father managed somehow to get his affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg 
 but what have they been up to asked the countess 
 they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back 
 what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughter 
 oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count 
 yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing 
 it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich son who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider 
 why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate 
 the visitor made a gesture with her hand 
 i should think he has a score of them 
 princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society 
 the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows count reputation he has lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite 
 how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess i have never seen a handsomer man 
 he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is my second cousin also my godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact 
 prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor 
 yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is 
 but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut 
 and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he said

 chapter 
 
 a charming introduction to a life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring 
 mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a calls about seven days ago he sent me a brace of last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married ring be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came 
 it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced 
 away away with it i replied i desire to have 
 the doctor says you must drop the powders 
 with all my heart interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your will continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways 
 he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i give my word for any i stated before that i know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning 
 much 
 good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared expect she seemed almost over fond of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness 
 it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say 
 nelly is that you 
 it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his 
 i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death i dared not enter you do not know me look not a stranger 
 a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deep set and singular i remembered the eyes 
 what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement what you come back is it really you is it 
 yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with mistress go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her 
 how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay no comprehending it have you been for a soldier 
 go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently in hell till you do 
 he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door 
 they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and person from gimmerton wishes to see you 
 what does he want asked mrs linton 
 i did not question him i answered 
 well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea be back again directly 
 she quitted the apartment mr edgar inquired carelessly who it was 
 someone mistress does not expect i replied that recollect him used to live at mr 
 what the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine 
 hush you must not call him by those names master i said be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off i guess his return will make a jubilee to her 
 mr linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity 
 oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh edgar darling come is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze 
 well well cried her husband crossly strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic 
 i know you like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now shall i tell him to come up 
 here he said into the parlour 
 where else she asked 
 he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him mrs linton eyed him with a droll angry half laughing at his fastidiousness 
 no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions run down and secure my guest afraid the joy is too great to be real 
 she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her 
 you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother 
 i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking but the glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized reluctant fingers and crushed them into his now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff he had grown a tall athletic man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation a ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace my surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak 
 sit down sir he said at length mrs linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her 
 and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly 
 he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment not so mr edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized hands again and laughed like one beside herself 
 i shall think it a dream tomorrow she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more and yet cruel heathcliff you deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me 
 a little more than you have thought of me he murmured i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you 
 catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness mr heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge tonight and thirsty 
 she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room the meal hardly endured ten minutes cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton 
 no to wuthering heights he answered mr earnshaw invited me when i called this morning 
 mr earnshaw invited him and he called on mr earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away 
 about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me 
 i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him 
 what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised human nature let mr linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them 
 but does it not show great weakness pursued she not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same 
 mistaken mrs linton said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you 
 and then we shall fight to the death we nelly she returned laughing no i tell you i have such faith in love that i believe i might kill him and he wish to retaliate 
 i advised her to value him the more for his affection 
 i do she answered but he resort to whining for trifles it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him sure he behaved excellently 
 what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around 
 he explained it she replied i wondered as much as you he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other 
 a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs linton 
 none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence oh endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as l however over and take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek not only turn the other but ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof go make my peace with edgar instantly good night an angel 
 in this conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine 
 heathcliff i should say in the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling my uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space 
 his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a power he had sense to comprehend disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to his keeping he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on deliberate designing 
 we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of she was dwindling and fading before our eyes but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only harshness which made her unhappy 
 how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me 
 yesterday sobbed isabella and now 
 yesterday said her on what occasion 
 in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr heathcliff 
 and your notion of harshness said catherine laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous we care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears 
 oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there 
 is she sane asked mrs linton appealing to me repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you 
 i mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with 
 well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence 
 with him and i be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself 
 you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs linton in surprise but not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella 
 no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him 
 i be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly help me to convince her of her madness tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone as soon put that little canary into the park on a day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head pray imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior not a rough oyster of a rustic a fierce pitiless wolfish man i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and crush you like a egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge i know he love a linton and yet be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin my picture and his much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap 
 miss linton regarded her with indignation 
 for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend 
 ah you believe me then said catherine you think i speak from wicked selfishness 
 certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you 
 good cried the other try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence 
 and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs linton left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods she mr heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her 
 banish him from your thoughts miss i said a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs linton spoke strongly and yet i contradict her she is better acquainted with his heart than i or anyone besides and she would never represent him as worse than he is honest people hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr earnshaw is worse and worse since he came they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week was joseph who told met him at gimmerton nelly he said hae a quest enah at ahr folks one on getten his finger cut off wi hauding froo sticking hisseln loike a cawlf maister yah knaw soa up uh going tuh t grand sizes noan feard uh t bench uh judges norther paul nur peter nur john nur matthew nor noan on em nut he he fair langs to set his brazened face agean em and yon bonny lad heathcliff yah mind a rare un he can girn a laugh as onybody at a raight jest does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us when he goas tuh t grange this is t way at sundahn dice brandy cloised shutters und till next day at nooin then t fooil gangs banning un raving to his makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shaume un the knave wah he carn cahnt his brass un ate un sleep un off to his tuh gossip wi t wife i course he tells dame catherine hah hor goold runs intuh his pocket and her son gallops dahn t broad road while he flees afore to oppen t pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you 
 you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world 
 whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect the day after there was a at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable 
 come in right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose heathcliff proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself i expect you to feel flattered nay not nelly look at her my poor little is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty it lies in your own power to be brother no no isabella you run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion 
 catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression 
 as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor 
 by no means cried mrs linton in answer i be named a dog in the manger again you shall stay now then heathcliff why you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before walk from sorrow and rage that i dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable 
 i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises the poor thing bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the with crescents of red 
 a tigress exclaimed mrs linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain begone for sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him you fancy the conclusions draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do must beware of your eyes 
 wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you 
 i assure you i was she returned she has been pining for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration but notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness all i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up 
 and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble 
 delectably observed catherine they are 
 her heir is she not he asked after a brief silence 
 i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your goods remember this goods are mine 
 if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short dismiss the matter as you advise 
 from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i saw him smile to lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment 
 i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the in preference to side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy

 chapter ten 
 
 as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed aunt and her family of chicks beth had fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there 
 gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original one of these was the for as secret societies were the was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor at seven the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they reminded each other of their faults and short comings on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read

 anniversary ode 
 again we meet to celebrate 
 with badge and solemn rite 
 our anniversary 
 in pickwick hall tonight 
 we all are here in perfect health 
 none gone from our small band 
 again we see each face 
 and press each friendly hand 
 our pickwick always at his post 
 with reverence we greet 
 as spectacles on nose he reads 
 our weekly sheet 
 although he suffers from a cold 
 we joy to hear him speak 
 for words of wisdom from him fall 
 in spite of croak or squeak 
 old snodgrass looms on high 
 with elephantine grace 
 and beams upon the company 
 with brown and jovial face 
 poetic fire lights up his eye 
 he struggles gainst his lot 
 behold ambition on his brow 
 and on his nose a blot 
 next our peaceful tupman comes 
 so rosy plump and sweet 
 who chokes with laughter at the puns 
 and tumbles off his seat 
 prim little winkle too is here 
 with every hair in place 
 a model of propriety 
 though he hates to wash his face 
 the year is gone we still unite 
 to joke and laugh and read 
 and tread the path of literature 
 that doth to glory lead 
 long may our paper prosper well 
 our club unbroken be 
 and coming years their blessings pour 
 on the useful gay p c

 the masked marriage 
 a tale of venice 
 gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance 
 sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm 
 yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates 
 by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour 
 tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus 
 my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation 
 
 gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing 
 but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty 
 my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife 
 the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage

 a sad accident 
 
 on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well 
 ed 
 the public bereavement 
 it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend mrs snowball pat paw this lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community 
 when last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms basely stole her weeks have passed but no trace of her has been discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us forever 
 
 a sympathizing friend sends the following gem 
 
 a lament 
 for s b pat paw 
 we mourn the loss of our little pet 
 and sigh her hapless fate 
 for never more by the fire sit 
 nor play by the old green gate 
 the little grave where her infant sleeps 
 is neath the chestnut tree 
 but her grave we may not weep 
 we know not where it may be 
 her empty bed her idle ball 
 will never see her more 
 no gentle tap no loving purr 
 is heard at the parlor door 
 another cat comes after her mice 
 a cat with a dirty face 
 but she does not hunt as our darling did 
 nor play with her airy grace 
 her stealthy paws tread the very hall 
 where snowball used to play 
 but she only spits at the dogs our pet 
 so gallantly drove away 
 she is useful and mild and does her best 
 but she is not fair to see 
 and we cannot give her your place dear 
 nor worship her as we worship thee

 as the president finished reading the paper which i beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr snodgrass rose to make a proposition 
 mr president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice i propose mr theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p c come now do have him 
 sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat 
 put it to a vote said the president all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying aye 
 say no 
 meg and amy were and mr winkle rose to say with great elegance we wish any boys they only joke and bounce about this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper 
 afraid laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful 
 up rose snodgrass very much in earnest sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie do anything of the sort he likes to write and give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes 
 this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind 
 yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes 
 this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly now then vote again everybody remember our laurie and say aye cried snodgrass excitedly 
 aye aye aye replied three voices at once 
 good bless you now as nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter 
 you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy 
 the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr president and beg pardon me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club 
 good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned 
 my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing 
 come now lay it all on yourself you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly 
 never mind what she says the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr pickwick but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club 
 hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal 
 go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly 
 i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if i may be allowed the expression the old martin house but stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat 
 great applause as mr weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored a long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted and jovial member no club could have he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought 
 the p o was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with charms actually sent a love letter to care how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come

 runs up to door and rattles the knob 
 still locked he bends down and looks in through the keyhole 
 room night 
 imhotep leans down towards evelyn about to kiss her as she 
 sleeps the door starts to crash and bang from 
 imhotep ignores it and kisses evelyn his lips and mouth 
 instantly start to degenerate and decay right down to the 
 bone the door bursts open evelyn sees 
 rotted mouth kissing her she screams and shoves him away 
 putrid mouth grimaces in sadness

 sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
 imhotep licks his fetid lips smirks 
 
 nice lips 
 imhotep starts to move for 
 
 i figured you might be here 
 so i brought a friend 
 he throws the white cat at imhotep imhotep instinctively 
 catches it he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back 
 towards the window which suddenly blows open imhotep 
 spins like a dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand 
 everybody covers their eyes the explodes 
 out the window and vanishes over the compound 
 jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly 
 hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust 
 daniels walks in looks at shriveled body on 
 the floor and drops the martini glasses 
 int convertible dussenberg night 
 jonathan races his big convertible through the streets 
 honking constantly evelyn sits between him and 
 looking scared and nervous then she gives a look 
 evelyn 
 you called me your girl 
 
 what oh yeah that was just 
 um you know figure a speech 
 evelyn 
 i think you were jealous 
 
 jealous you kiddin me did 
 you see that face 
 daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear 
 daniels 
 just we gotta 
 do somethin we gotta do somethin 
 now before too late 
 they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities 
 ext cairo bazaar night 
 a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling 
 with activity suddenly a breeze green mist begins 
 to swirl down the street and through the stalls the people 
 begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a 
 severe sickness already too late 
 imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half 
 rotted off his deformed mouth grinning happily beni is 
 at his side looking very nervous and then 
 the people silently begin to follow imhotep their skin 
 now covered in disgustingly hideous boils and sores 
 int museum of antiquities night 
 jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth bay 
 evelyn as she strides through the museum 
 evelyn 
 last month i came across an 
 inscription that mentioned 
 the book of the dead 
 daniels 
 that book we found at hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes i dismissed it because it 
 talked about bringing people 
 back from the dead a notion 
 i was unwilling to believe 
 
 believe it sister what 
 brought our buddy back to life 
 jonathan 
 and now going to use it 
 to bring his girlfriend back 
 ardeth bay 
 and if he succeeds the two of 
 them together will bring about 
 the apocalypse 
 the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
 stairs everyone else in hot pursuit 
 the curator 
 the plagues we have seen so far 
 are merely imhotep flexing his 
 muscles only at the moment of 
 resurrection 
 will he be truly invincible 
 they reach the display cases evelyn quickly opens them 
 evelyn 
 thinking that if the black 
 book of the dead can bring people 
 back to life 
 curator 
 then perhaps the golden book 
 of the living can return them 
 to the underworld 
 evelyn 
 exactly 
 
 so your sayin if we find the 
 book made outta gold 
 curator 
 and read the sacred incantations 
 contained inside it 
 
 you think send this guy 
 back to hell 
 curator 
 correct 
 and when loud chanting is heard coming from outside 
 they all rush over to the upper windows and look down 
 outside a large crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores 
 comes chanting up the driveway 
 ardeth bay 
 it has begun the beginning of 
 the end 
 evelyn 
 not quite yet it 
 evelyn dashes back to the display cases everyone follows 
 ext museum night 
 the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are 
 locked they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while 
 chanting constantly imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway 
 int museum of antiquities upper balcony night 
 the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
 curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets 
 the others watch evelyn pulls out a large piece 
 evelyn 
 got it 
 
 got what 
 the banging gets louder multiple windows shatter evelyn 
 talks while quickly translating the tablet 
 evelyn 
 since the black book of the dead 
 was found inside the statue of 
 anubis then according to this 
 the golden book of the living 
 should be inside 
 evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles 
 
 what 
 jonathan 
 what 
 daniels 
 what 
 evelyn 
 the golden book of the living 
 is inside the statue of 
 curator 
 which would be located not far to 
 the east of the anubis statue 
 
 tell me we gotta go back 
 out there 
 curator 
 if we want to kill the creature yes 
 two hideous boil men charge out of a doorway 
 screaming and ardeth bay grab them and chuck them 
 over the railing the men fly through the air and crash into 
 the lower display cases the front doors suddenly burst open 
 the crazed mob pours into the museum our heroes 
 across the balcony and down the staircase 
 ext museum of antiquity night 
 jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
 convertible suddenly a splinter group of the diseased mob 
 comes around the side of the museum jonathan instantly bugs 
 his eyes out starts drooling and begins chanting 
 jonathan 
 
 the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
 of the museum jonathan leaps into the convertible fires it 
 up and s it back over to the bushes 
 evelyn daniels ardeth bay and the curator jump 
 inside the car beni steps out of the museum and sees them 
 beni 
 imhotep imhotep 
 imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
 windows just as the convertible peels out points a 
 finger at beni as they race past him 
 
 gonna get yours pal 
 imhotep unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
 size he lets out one of his horrific primordial shrieks 
 his disciples immediately begin pouring out 
 of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car 
 ext bazaar night 
 the convertible down the narrow bazaar street 
 crazies start jumping out of stalls and leaping onto the 
 car and the others fight them off throwing them 
 overboard more people jump on jonathan swerves the car 
 crashes through some stalls knocking them off but not 
 before they manage to open the back door and yank daniels 
 out he tumbles across the pavement gets up shooting backs 
 into a corner firing his pistol into the hideous rabble 
 killing several keeping them at bay his gun goes empty 
 click click click but the mob stays back looking at him 
 like rabid vultures daniels eyes them filled with fear 
 the mob parts like the red sea as imhotep walks through them 
 and up to daniels daniels whimpers in fear tears pour down 
 his cheeks then he gets an idea reaches into his pocket 
 and pulls out his jewel encrusted sacred canopic jar he 
 holds it out for imhotep imhotep takes it and grins through 
 his tears daniels grins back hopeful that be spared 
 we cut wide somewhere in the middle of the crazed diseased 
 mob we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream 
 convertible streets night 
 the convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys we 
 dolly across the hood of the car from jonathan to evelyn to 
 ardeth bay and the curator are still in the back 
 all of them staring out the front windshield 
 then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls crashes through the 
 windshield everybody screams jonathan hits the gas loses 
 control the car slams into a wall grabs evelyn 
 
 go go 
 
 they all leap out of the car but the angry festering mob 
 quickly surrounds them quickly reaches into his 
 pulls out a stick of dynamite then reaches into 
 his pocket and pulls out a match he looks around for a way 
 to light it then reaches over and strikes it across ardeth 
 stubbly face ardeth bay yelps holds the lit 
 match near the fuse 
 the crazed chanting mob gives a wide berth 
 staring at him and the others with insane bloodshot eyes 
 and then imhotep steps through having fully regenerated 
 he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the 
 day he was buried alive evelyn stares at him 
 evelyn 
 gorgeous 
 gives her a look the match burns his fingers he 
 yelps and throws it down grabs another match and strikes it 
 across ardeth face again ardeth bay yelps and gives 
 a look to kill the curator shakes his head 
 the curator 
 he has consummated the curse 
 now all he need do is raise 
 from the dead 
 then it will be the end of us 
 and the beginning for them 
 imhotep moves forward heading right for them 
 lights the fuse imhotep steps up to and stops 
 watching the fuse burn down a game of chicken the 
 tension mounts the lit fuse is about to vanish inside the 
 stick of dynamite blowing it up when evelyn leans forward 
 and blows it out exhales but keeps his eyes on 
 imhotep who extends his hand to evelyn 
 imhotep 
 koontash dai na 
 beni steps through the swarming mass translating 
 beni 
 take his hand and he will 
 spare the others 
 evelyn hesitates looks around at the huge bloodthirsty 
 crowd surrounding them holding axes picks and scimitars 
 waiting to pounce then she looks at imhotep confident 
 powerful invincible then she looks at 
 evelyn 
 any bright ideas 
 
 talks through angry grit teeth 
 
 sorry fresh out 
 evelyn looks back at imhotep then starts to reach out to 
 take his hand both and jonathan move to stop her 
 but ardeth bay grabs them both and holds them tight

 evelyn

 trembling hand touches his hand closes 
 around hers nothing happens imhotep smiles 
 imhotep 
 keetah mi pharos aja nilo isirlan 
 beni

 time to make you mine forever 
 evelyn gives beni a nasty look correcting him 
 evelyn

 evelyn

 because if he turns me into a 
 mummy your the first one

 rips the out of upper jacket pocket

 int burnham house family room moments later 
 close on the tv screen the flintstones theme song plays and fred flintstone bangs on the door of his prehistoric home yelling wilma as the closing credits scroll past 
 lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear drinking abeer and watching tv his working out is beginning to produce results carolyn enters through the kitchen she stands there staring at lester after a moment he looks up at her

 carolyn regards him through narrow eyes filled with hate 
 not as helpless as you think i am 
 he looks up at her carolyn holds his gaze for a beat thenturns and walks out of the room 
 int fitts house bedroom continuous 
 we hear atomic soda 
 on video outside in a wooded area looking up at the sun through tree branches then we pan down to see a path through the trees in front of us something out of focus crosses by in front us obscuring our view we slowly zoom back and see that jane or rather just a corner of her face as she looks at us her eyes shining her hand brushes the hair off her face and we stay on her hand it swings back and forth gracefully she walks ahead in front of us we jump cut to 
 on video close on naked calves her jeans rolled up as she dangles her feet in a pond the water ripples in concentric circles every time she dips her toes in not unlike the water in the jail cell sink at the beginning we jump cut to 
 on video moving in a circle as jane runs around us in the opposite direction so that we see only flashes of her running by laughing jump cut to 
 on video jane in profile looking toward the sky her yesshut enjoying the sun on her face 
 ricky beautiful 
 she looks at us and smiles her guard down her face empty ofits usual vaguely contemptuous expression and indeed she is beautiful young happy hopeful we linger on her face for a moment she brings her hand up to caress her cheek and then still smiling she slowly flips us the bird we jump cut to 
 on video looking at shadow clearly delineated by the bright sun against a textured carpet of fallen leaves on the forest floor we hear her giggle as she makes shadow puppets with her hand then we move around so that looking up at her silhouetted against the bun even though we make out her features this image seems transcendent almost religious 
 on video jane in bed naked she quickly pulls a sheet up over her breasts 
 t 
 pulling back we see been watching the tv in room 
 a cord leads from the tv to video camera ricky holds the camera sitting naked in his desk chair been almost a month since he was beaten up by his father and there are a couple of slight scars on his face focusing his camera on jane lying in his bed we see her image on the tv atomic soda plays on the stereo

 int room 
 neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better he is 
 wearing a black tank top and shorts 
 he begins to examine himself there is a futuristic iv 
 plugged into the jack in his forearm he pulls it out 
 staring at the grafted outlet 
 he feels his bald head his fingers find and explore the 
 large outlet in the base of his skull 
 just as he starts to come unglued morpheus opens the 
 door 
 neo 
 morpheus happened to me 
 what is this place 
 morpheus 
 more important than what is when 
 neo 
 when 
 morpheus 
 you believe the year is when in fact it is much closer to 
 i say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not 
 know 
 the wind is knocked from chest 
 neo 
 not possible 
 morpheus 
 i promised you the truth neo and the truth is that the world you 
 were living in was a lie 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 show you 
 
 int hovercraft 
 like a sleepwalker neo follows morpheus through the ship 
 morpheus 
 this is my ship the nebuchadnezzar a hovercraft small like a 
 submarine dark cramped and cold but home 
 they climb a ladder up to the main deck 
 
 int main deck 
 everyone is there 
 morpheus 
 this is the main deck you know most of my crew 
 trinity smiles and nods 
 morpheus 
 the ones you know mouse and switch the two big 
 guys are tank and dozer 
 the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo 
 morpheus 
 and this this is the core this is where we broadcast our pirate 
 signal and hack into the matrix 
 it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment vines of 
 coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic 
 battery slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks 
 of little systems and computer monitors 
 at the center of the web there are six ectoskeleton 
 chairs made of a frame and suspension harness 
 near the circle of chairs is the control console and 
 station where the network is monitored 
 morpheus 
 help him trinity 
 neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs 
 morpheus 
 do you remember when i asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality 
 neo nods 
 morpheus 
 right here 
 he touches head 
 morpheus 
 and accessed here 
 neo feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack 
 at the back of his neck the cable has the same kind of 
 cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant 
 morpheus 
 this will feel a little weird 
 there are several disturbing noises as he works the 
 needle in 
 we move in as shoulders bunch and his face tightens 
 into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop 
 like when you equalize them underwater 
 he relaxes opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling 
 of weightlessness inside another place 
 
 int construct 
 neo is standing in an empty space 
 morpheus 
 this is the construct 
 startled neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the 
 room with him 
 morpheus 
 it is our loading program we can load anything from clothes to 
 weapons to training simulations anything we need 
 morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the 
 two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a 
 television 
 morpheus 
 sit down 
 neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits 
 neo 
 right now inside a computer program 
 morpheus 
 wild it 
 hands run over the cracked leather 
 neo 
 this real 
 morpheus 
 what is real how do you define real if talking about 
 your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all 
 talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain 
 he picks up a remote control and clicks on the 
 television we drift through the windy city circa 
 morpheus 
 this is the chicago you know chicago as it was at the end of 
 the twentieth century this chicago exists only as part of a 
 simulation that we call the matrix 
 we glide at the television as he changes the channel 
 morpheus 
 you have been living inside vision inside the 
 map not the territory this is chicago as it exists today 
 the sky is an endless sea of black and green bile the 
 earth scorched and split like burnt flesh spreads out 
 beneath us as we enter the television 
 morpheus 
 the desert of the real 
 in the distance we see the ruins of a future chicago 
 protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of 
 a corpse 
 morpheus 
 we are right now miles below the surface the only place 
 humans can survive outside the matrix is underground 
 still moving we turn and find neo and morpheus the 
 chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert 
 dizzy neo holds onto the chair 
 neo 
 what happened 
 morpheus 
 it started early in the twenty first century with the birth of 
 artificial intelligence a singular consciousness that 
 spawned an entire race of machines 
 in his sunglasses we see storm clouds gather 
 morpheus 
 at first all they wanted was to be treated as equals entitled to the 
 same human inalienable rights whatever they were given it was not enough 
 in the circular window of the glasses explosions light 
 up a bloody battle field 
 morpheus 
 we know who struck first us or them but sometime at the 
 end of the century the battle was joined 
 we move into his glasses and the war surrounds us 
 morpheus 
 the war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red 
 at last we see the sentinels killing machines that are 
 at once terrifying and beautiful they have an organic 
 architecture like a microbiotic organism that is 
 perpetually in motion 
 the sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier 
 splitting open the soft stearing meat inside 
 morpheus 
 it scorched and burned the sky without the sun the machines 
 sought out a new energy source to survive 
 the sentinel locks up as heat lightning of black ink 
 bursts against the sky spreading into a permanent cloud 
 of stain 
 morpheus 
 they discovered a new form of fusion all that was required to 
 initiate the reaction was a small electric charge throughout human 
 history we have been dependent on machines to survive fate it 
 seems is not without a sense of irony 
 we return to the power plant that neo escaped from where 
 we see human beings looking almost blissful in their 
 gelatin cocoons 
 morpheus 
 the human body generates more bio electricity than a volt 
 battery and over of body heat 
 outside spreading all around the power plant beneath a 
 breathing greenhouse are the growing fields 
 morpheus 
 we are as an energy source easily renewable and completely 
 recyclable the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living 
 huge reapers are harvesting the crop 
 morpheus 
 all they needed to control this new battery was something to 
 occupy our mind 
 we see inside a clear tubular husk floating in viscous 
 fluid there is a human fetus its soft skull already 
 growing around the 
 morpheus 
 and so they built a prison out of our past wired it to our brains 
 and turned us into slaves 
 we pull back to find the image is now on the television 
 and we are again inside the white space of the construct 
 neo 
 no i believe it not possible 
 morpheus 
 i say that it would be easy neo i just said that it 
 would be the truth 
 the room without walls begins to spin 
 neo 
 stop let me out i want out

lionfish nov chapter ten the rogue bludgercontents prev chapter next chapter 
 since the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class instead he read passages from his books to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructions so far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a head cold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since lockhart had dealt with him 
 
 harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next defense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf if he had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a good mood he would have refused to do it 
 
 nice loud howl harry exactly and then if believe it i pounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand i managed to hold him down with my other i put my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he let out a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the fur vanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simple yet effective and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks 
 
 the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet 
 
 homework compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of the best one 
 
 the class began to leave harry returned to the back of the room where ron and hermione were waiting 
 
 ready harry muttered 
 
 wait till gone said hermione nervously all right 
 
 she approached desk a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand harry and ron right behind her 
 
 er professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to to get this book out of the library just for background reading she held out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thing is in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher to sign for it sure it would help me understand what you say in gadding with ghouls about venoms 
 
 ah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note from hermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favorite book you enjoyed it 
 
 oh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped that last one with the 
 
 well sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill yes nice it he said misreading the revolted look on face i usually save it for 
 
 he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to hermione 
 
 so harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag the first quidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherin is it not i hear a useful player i was a seeker too i was asked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the need for a little private training hesitate to ask always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players 
 
 harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after ron and hermione 
 
 i believe it he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note he even look at the book we wanted 
 
 because a brainless git said ron but who cares got what we needed 
 
 he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library 
 
 just because he said you were the best student of the year 
 
 they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture 
 
 moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take the note from hermione but hermione let go 
 
 i was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlessly 
 
 oh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at madam pince get you another autograph sign anything if it stands still long enough 
 
 madam pince held the note up to the light as though determined to detect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and book hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty 
 
 five minutes later they were barricaded in moaning bathroom once again hermione had overridden objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtle was crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and she them 
 
 hermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three of them bent over the pages it was clear from a glance why it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some very unpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head 
 
 here it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed the polyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces 
 
 this is the most complicated potion ever seen said hermione as they scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed and knotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list of ingredients well easy enough in the student we can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of a bicorn know where going to get that shredded skin of a boomslang be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into 
 
 excuse me said ron sharply what mean a bit of whoever changing into drinking nothing with toenails in it 
 
 hermione continued as though she heard him 
 
 we have to worry about that yet though because we add those bits last 
 
 ron turned speechless to harry who had another worry 
 
 realize how much going to have to steal hermione shredded skin of a boomslang definitely not in the we going to do break into private stores i know if this is a good idea 
 
 hermione shut the book with a snap 
 
 well if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual i want to break rules you know i think threatening is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but if you want to find out if malfoy go straight to madam pince now and hand the book back in 
 
 
 i never thought id see the day when be persuading us to break rules said ron all right do it but not toenails okay 
 
 how long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermione looking happier opened the book again 
 
 well since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for days say be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredients 
 
 a month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the in the school by then but eyes narrowed dangerously again and he added swiftly but the best plan got so full steam ahead i say 
 
 however while hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry be a lot less hassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow 
 
 harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at the thought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly after half an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got up dressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the rest of the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all looking uptight and not speaking much 
 
 as eleven approached the whole school started to make its way down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurrying over to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to usual pep talk 
 
 slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but got better people on our brooms trained harder than they have been flying in all weathers too true muttered george weasley i been properly dry since august and going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime malfoy buy his way onto their team 
 
 chest heaving with emotion wood turned to harry 
 
 be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to have something more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because got to win today got to 
 
 so no pressure harry said fred winking at him 
 
 as they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to see slytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flint and wood to shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary 
 
 on my whistle said madam hooch three two one 
 
 with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any of them squinting around for the snitch 
 
 all right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom 
 
 harry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed 
 
 close one harry said george streaking past him with his club in his hand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry saw george give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrian pucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for harry again 
 
 harry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hard toward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at head 
 
 harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible 
 
 fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harry ducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludger was knocked off course 
 
 gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him once more and harry was forced to fly off at full speed 
 
 it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero 
 
 
 the brooms were clearly doing their jobs and meanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harry out of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch it 
 
 tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on harry 
 
 we need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stop the bludger breaking nose at the same time 
 
 wood had obviously got the message madam whistle rang out and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying to avoid the mad bludger 
 
 going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins in the crowd jeered being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring 
 
 we were twenty feet above her stopping the other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily fixed it it leave harry alone it gone for anyone else all game the slytherins must have done something to it 
 
 but the bludgers have been locked in madam office since our last practice and there was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction 
 
 listen said harry as she came nearer and nearer with you two flying around me all the time the only way going to catch the snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one 
 
 be thick said fred take your head off 
 
 wood was looking from harry to the weasleys 
 
 oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you let harry deal with that thing on his own ask for an inquiry 
 
 if we stop now have to forfeit the match said harry and not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger come on oliver tell them to leave me alone 
 
 this is all your fault george said angrily to wood get the snitch or die a stupid thing to tell him 
 
 madam hooch had joined them 
 
 ready to resume play she asked wood 
 
 wood looked at the determined look on face 
 
 all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone and let him deal with the bludger on his own 
 
 the rain was falling more heavily now on madam whistle harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the bludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped and swooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from the bludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he must look very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and change direction as quickly as harry could he began a kind of ride around the edges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get past wood 
 
 a whistling in ear told him the bludger had just missed him again he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction 
 
 training for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled the bludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back at malfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inches above left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry seen it 
 
 for an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speed toward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch 
 
 wham 
 
 he had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by the searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this time zooming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain get to malfoy 
 
 through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him 
 
 what the he gasped careening out of way 
 
 harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch he felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to pass out 
 
 with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting he focused on the snitch clutched in his good hand 
 
 aha he said vaguely won 
 
 and he fainted 
 
 he came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field with someone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teeth 
 
 oh no not you he moaned 
 
 know what saying said lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of gryffindors pressing around them not to worry harry about to fix your arm 
 
 no said harry keep it like this thanks 
 
 he tried to sit up but the pain was terrible he heard a familiar clicking noise nearby 
 
 i want a photo of this colin he said loudly 
 
 lie back harry said lockhart soothingly a simple charm used countless times 
 
 why i just go to the hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he should really professor said a muddy wood who help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet say 
 
 through the thicket of legs around him harry spotted fred and george weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was still putting up a terrific fight 
 
 stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his sleeves 
 
 no said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at arm 
 
 a strange and unpleasant sensation started at shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm 
 
 ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is the bones are no longer broken the thing to bear in mind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will be able to er tidy you up a bit 
 
 as harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again 
 
 poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick rubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happened 
 
 lockhart mended bones he had removed them 
 
 madam pomfrey at all pleased 
 
 you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back 
 
 you will be able to you said harry desperately 
 
 be able to certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry a pair of pajamas have to stay the night 
 
 hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took a while to stuff the rubbery boneless arm into a sleeve 
 
 how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through the curtain as he pulled limp fingers through the cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked 
 
 anyone can make a mistake said hermione and it hurt anymore does it harry 
 
 no said harry getting into bed but it do anything else either 
 
 as he swung himself onto the bed his arm flapped pointlessly 
 
 hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain madam pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled 
 
 in for a rough night she said pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him regrowing bones is a nasty business 
 
 so was taking the it burned mouth and throat as it went down making him cough and splutter still about dangerous sports and inept teachers madam pomfrey retreated leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron a grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made face he looked ready to kill 
 
 i want to know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that to the list of questions ask him when taken the polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows i hope it tastes better than this stuff 
 
 if got bits of slytherins in it got to be joking said ron 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy and soaking wet the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to see harry unbelievable flying harry said george just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy something about having the snitch on top of his head and not noticing malfoy seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest got bones to regrow out out and harry was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm 
 
 hours and hours later harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full of large splinters for a second he thought that was what had woken him then with a thrill of horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark 
 
 get off he said loudly and then dobby 
 
 the goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through the darkness a single tear was running down his long pointed nose 
 
 harry potter came back to school he whispered miserably dobby warned and warned harry potter ah sir why you heed dobby why harry potter go back home when he missed the train 
 
 harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed sponge away 
 
 you doing here he said and how did you know i missed the train 
 
 lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion 
 
 it was you he said slowly you stopped the barrier from letting us through 
 
 indeed yes sir said dobby nodding his head vigorously ears flapping dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed the gateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward he showed harry ten long bandaged fingers but dobby care sir for he thought harry potter was safe and never did dobby dream that harry potter would get to school another way 
 
 he was rocking backward and forward shaking his ugly head 
 
 dobby was so shocked when he heard harry potter was back at hogwarts he let his dinner burn such a flogging dobby never had sir 
 
 harry slumped back onto his pillows 
 
 you nearly got ron and me expelled he said fiercely better get lost before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you 
 
 dobby smiled weakly 
 
 dobby is used to death threats sir dobby gets them five times a day at home 
 
 he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore looking so pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself 
 
 why wear that thing dobby he asked curiously 
 
 this sir said dobby plucking at the pillowcase tis a mark of the enslavement sir dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes sir the family is careful not to pass dobby even a sock sir for then he would be free to leave their house forever 
 
 dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly harry potter must go home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make 
 
 your bludger said harry anger rising once more what mean your bludger you made that bludger try and kill me 
 
 not kill you sir never kill you said dobby shocked dobby wants to save harry life better sent home grievously injured than remain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to be sent home 
 
 oh is that all said harry angrily i suppose going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces 
 
 ah if harry potter only knew dobby groaned more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase if he knew what he means to us to the lowly the enslaved we dregs of the magical world dobby remembers how it was when was at the height of his powers sir we were treated like vermin sir of course dobby is still treated like that sir he admitted drying his face on the pillowcase but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over harry potter survived and the dark power was broken and it was a new dawn sir and harry potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end sit and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more 
 
 dobby froze horrorstruck then grabbed water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight a second later he crawled back onto the bed muttering bad dobby very bad dobby 
 
 so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered and did you say been opened before tell me dobby 
 
 he seized the bony wrist as hand inched toward the water jug but not how can i be in danger from the chamber 
 
 ah sir ask no more ask no more of poor dobby stammered the elf his eyes huge in the dark dark deeds are planned in this place but harry potter must not be here when they happen go home harry potter go home harry potter must not meddle in this sir tis too dangerous 
 
 who is it dobby harry said keeping a firm hold on wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again opened it who opened it last time 
 
 dobby sir dobby dobby tell squealed the elf go home harry potter go home 
 
 not going anywhere said harry fiercely one of my best friends is be first in line if the chamber really has been opened 
 
 harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy so noble so valiant but he must save himself he must harry potter must not 
 
 dobby suddenly froze his bat ears quivering harry heard it too there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside 
 
 dobby must go breathed the elf terrified there was a loud crack and fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer 
 
 next moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one end of what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared a second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bed 
 
 get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall hurried past the end of bed out of sight harry lay quite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress he heard a sharp intake of breath 
 
 what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore bending over the statue on the bed 
 
 another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairs 
 
 there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter 
 
 stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a ray of moonlight lay across its staring face 
 
 it was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him holding his camera
