lionfish nov chapter occlumencycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic sirius said he had found him up there covered in dust no doubt looking for more relics of the black family to hide in his cupboard though sirius seemed satisfied with this story it made harry uneasy kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual though once or twice harry caught the staring at him avidly but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that harry had noticed 
 
 harry did not mention his vague suspicions to sirius whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that christmas was over as the date of their departure back to hogwarts drew nearer he became more and more prone to what mrs weasley called fits of the sullens in which he would become taciturn and grumpy often withdrawing to room for hours at a time his gloom seeped through the house oozing under doorways like some noxious gas so that all of them became infected by it 
 
 harry want to leave sirius again with only kreacher for company in fact for the first time in his life he was not looking forward to returning to hogwarts going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of dolores umbridge who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence there was no quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer and dumbledore remained as remote as ever in fact if it been for the da harry thought he might have begged sirius to let him leave hogwarts and remain in grimmauld place 
 
 then on the very last day of the holidays something happened that made harry positively dread his return to school 
 
 harry dear said mrs weasley poking her head into his and bedroom where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by hermione ginny and crookshanks could you come down to the kitchen professor snape would like a word with you 
 
 harry did not immediately register what she had said one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of and he was egging it on enthusiastically 
 
 squash him squash him only a pawn you idiot sorry mrs weasley what did you say 
 
 professor snape dear in the kitchen like a word 
 
 mouth fell open in horror he looked around at ron hermione and ginny all of whom were gaping back at him crookshanks whom hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover squealing at the top of their voices 
 
 snape said harry blankly 
 
 professor snape dear said mrs weasley reprovingly now come on quickly he says he stay long 
 
 he want with you said ron looking unnerved as mrs weasley withdrew from the room you done anything have you 
 
 no said harry indignantly racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make snape pursue him to grimmauld place had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a t 
 
 a minute or two later he pushed open the kitchen door to find sirius and snape both seated at the long kitchen table glaring in opposite directions the silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike a letter lay open on the table in front of sirius 
 
 er said harry to announce his presence 
 
 snape looked around at him his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair 
 
 sit down potter 
 
 you know said sirius loudly leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling i think prefer it if you give orders here snape my house you see 
 
 an ugly flush suffused pallid face harry sat down in a chair beside sirius facing snape across the table 
 
 i was supposed to see you alone potter said snape the familiar sneer curling his mouth but black 
 
 his godfather said sirius louder than ever 
 
 i am here on orders said snape whose voice by contrast was becoming more and more quietly waspish but by all means stay black i know you like to feel involved 
 
 that supposed to mean said sirius letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang 
 
 merely that i am sure you must feelahfrustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful snape laid a delicate stress on the word for the order 
 
 it was turn to flush lip curled in triumph as he turned to harry 
 
 the headmaster has sent me to tell you potter that it is his wish for you to study occlumency this term 
 
 study what said harry blankly 
 
 sneer became more pronounced 
 
 occlumency potter the magical defence of the mind against external penetration an obscure branch of magic but a highly useful one 
 
 heart began to pump very fast indeed defence against external penetration but he was not being possessed they had all agreed on that 
 
 why do i have to study occluthing he blurted out 
 
 because the headmaster thinks it a good idea said snape smoothly you will receive private lessons once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all dolores umbridge you understand 
 
 yes said harry going to be teaching me 
 
 snape raised an eyebrow 
 
 i am he said 
 
 harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting 
 
 extra lessons with snapewhat on earth had he done to deserve this he looked quickly round at sirius for support 
 
 why dumbledore teach harry asked sirius aggressively why you 
 
 i suppose because it is a privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks said snape silkily i assure you i did not beg for the job he got to his feet i will expect you at six on monday evening potter my office if anybody asks you are taking remedial potions nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them 
 
 he turned to leave his black travelling cloak billowing behind him 
 
 wait a moment said sirius sitting up straighter in his chair 
 
 snape turned back to face them sneering 
 
 i am in rather a hurry black unlike you i do not have unlimited leisure time 
 
 get to the point then said sirius standing up he was rather taller than snape who harry noticed balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what harry was sure was the handle of his wand if i hear using these occlumency lessons to give harry a hard time have me to answer to 
 
 how touching snape sneered but surely you have noticed that potter is very like his father 
 
 yes i have said sirius proudly 
 
 well then know so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him snape said sleekly 
 
 sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards snape pulling out his wand as he went snape whipped out his own they were squaring up to each other sirius looking livid snape calculating his eyes darting from to his face 
 
 sirius said harry loudly but sirius appeared not to hear him 
 
 warned you snivelus said sirius his face barely a foot from i care if dumbledore thinks reformed i know better 
 
 oh but why you tell him so whispered snape or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his house for six months 
 
 tell me how is lucius malfoy these days i expect delighted his working at hogwarts he 
 
 speaking of dogs said snape softly did you know that lucius malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside clever idea black getting yourself seen on a safe station platform gave you a excuse not to leave your in future it 
 
 sirius raised his wand 
 
 no harry yelled vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them sirius 
 
 are you calling me a coward roared sirius trying to push harry out of the way but harry would not budge 
 
 why yes i suppose i am said snape 
 
 harryget outofit snarled sirius pushing him aside with his free hand 
 
 the kitchen door opened and the entire weasley family plus hermione came inside all looking very happy with mr weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh 
 
 cured he announced brightly to the kitchen at large completely cured 
 
 he and all the other weasleys froze on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which was also suspended in both sirius and snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each faces and harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each trying to force them apart 
 
 beard said mr weasley the smile sliding off his face going on here 
 
 both sirius and snape lowered their wands harry looked from one to the other each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses snape pocketed his wand turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen passing the weasleys without comment at the door he looked back 
 
 six monday evening potter 
 
 and he was gone sirius glared after him his wand at his side 
 
 been going on asked mr weasley again 
 
 nothing arthur said sirius who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance just a friendly little chat between two old school friends with what looked like an enormous effort he smiled so cured great news really great 
 
 yes it said mrs weasley leading her husband forward to a chair healer smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that got in its fangs and learned his lesson about dabbling in muggle medicine you dear she added rather menacingly 
 
 yes molly dear said mr weasley meekly 
 
 that meal should have been a cheerful one with mr weasley back amongst them harry could tell sirius was trying to make it so yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at fred and jokes or offering everyone more food his face fell back into a moody brooding expression harry was separated from him by mundungus and who had dropped in to offer mr weasley their congratulations he wanted to talk to sirius to tell him he listen to a word snape said that snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them think sirius was a coward for doing as dumbledore told him and remaining in grimmauld place but he had no opportunity to do so and eyeing the ugly look on face harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance instead he told ron and hermione under his voice about having to take occlumency lessons with snape 
 
 dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about voldemort said hermione at once well you be sorry not to have them any more will you 
 
 extra lessons with snape said ron sounding aghast rather have the nightmares 
 
 they were to return to hogwarts on the knight bus the following day escorted once again by tonks and lupin both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when harry ron and hermione came down next morning the adults seemed to have been through a whispered conversation as harry opened the door all of them looked round hastily and fell silent 
 
 after a hurried breakfast they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey january morning harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest he did not want to say goodbye to sirius he had a bad feeling about this parting he know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to sirius to stop him doing anything stupidharry was worried that accusation of cowardice had stung sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond grimmauld place before he could think of what to say however sirius had beckoned him to his side 
 
 i want you to take this he said quietly thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into hands 
 
 what is it harry asked 
 
 a way of letting me know if giving you a hard time no open it in here said sirius with a wary look at mrs weasley who was trying to persuade the twins to wear mittens i doubt molly would approvebut i want you to use it if you need me all right 
 
 ok said harry stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it was it would not be he harry who lured sirius from his place of safety no matter how foully snape treated him in their forthcoming occlumency classes 
 
 go then said sirius clapping harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly and before harry could say anything else they were heading upstairs stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door surrounded by weasleys 
 
 goodbye harry take care said mrs weasley hugging him 
 
 see you harry and keep an eye out for snakes for me said mr weasley genially shaking his hand 
 
 rightyeah said harry distractedly it was his last chance to tell sirius to be careful he turned looked into his face and opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so sirius was giving him a brief hug and saying gruffly look after yourself harry next moment harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air with tonks today heavily disguised as a tall tweedy woman with hair chivvying him down the steps 
 
 the door of number twelve slammed shut behind them they followed lupin down the front steps as he reached the pavement harry looked round number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone 
 
 come on the quicker we get on the bus the better said tonks and harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square lupin flung out his right arm 
 
 bang 
 
 a violently purple bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost which jumped backwards out of its way 
 
 a thin pimply youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said welcome to the 
 
 yes yes we know thank you said tonks swiftly on on get on 
 
 and she shoved harry forwards towards the steps past the conductor who goggled at harry as he passed 
 
 arry 
 
 if you shout his name i will curse you into oblivion muttered tonks menacingly now shunting ginny and hermione forwards 
 
 always wanted to go on this thing said ron happily joining harry on board and looking around 
 
 it had been evening the last time harry had travelled by knight bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads now in the early morning it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in grimmauld place a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet grumbling and shopping bag had slid the length of the bus an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor 
 
 looks like have to split up said tonks briskly looking for empty chairs fred george and ginny if you just take those seats at the back remus can stay with you 
 
 she harry ron and hermione proceeded up to the very top deck where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back stan shunpike the conductor followed harry and ron eagerly to the back heads turned as harry passed and when he sat down he saw all the faces flick back to the front again 
 
 as harry and ron handed stan eleven sickles each the bus set off again swaying ominously it rumbled around grimmauld place weaving on and off the pavement then with another tremendous bang they were all flung backwards chair toppled right over and pigwidgeon who had been on his lap burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to shoulder instead harry who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket looked out of the window they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway 
 
 just outside birmingham said stan happily answering unasked question as ron struggled up from the floor you keepin well then arry i seen your name in the paper loads over the summer but it never nuffink very nice i said to ern i said e seem like a nutter when we met im just goes to show dunnit 
 
 he handed over their tickets and continued to gaze enthralled at harry apparently stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they were famous enough to be in the paper the knight bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of cars on the inside looking towards the front of the bus harry saw hermione cover her eyes with her hands pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder 
 
 bang 
 
 chairs slid backwards again as the knight bus jumped from the birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges from here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills then to a windswept road between flats each time with a loud bang 
 
 changed my mind muttered ron picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time i never want to ride on this thing again 
 
 listen ogwarts stop after this said stan brightly swaying towards them that bossy woman up front oo got on with you given us a little tip to move you up the queue just gonna let madam marsh off first thoughthere was a retching sound from downstairs followed by a horrible spattering noise not feeling er best 
 
 a few minutes later the knight bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision they could hear stan ushering the unfortunate madam marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck the bus moved on again gathering speed until 
 
 bang 
 
 they were rolling through a snowy hogsmeade harry caught a glimpse of the head down its side street the severed head sign creaking in the wintry wind flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus at last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to hogwarts 
 
 lupin and tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage then got off to say goodbye harry glanced up at the three decks of the knight bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them noses flat against the windows 
 
 be safe once in the grounds said tonks casting a careful eye around at the deserted road have a good term ok 
 
 look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round and reaching harry last and listen he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged goodbyes with tonks harry i know you like snape but he is a superb occlumens and we allsirius includedwant you to learn to protect yourself so work hard all right 
 
 yeah all right said harry heavily looking up into prematurely lined face see you then 
 
 the six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle dragging their trunks hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors the knight bus had already gone and he given what was coming the following evening that he was still on board 
 
 harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening his morning lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation as snape was as unpleasant as ever his mood was further lowered by the da members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night 
 
 let you know in the usual way when the next one is harry said over and over again but i do it tonight got to go toerremedial potions 
 
 you take remedial potions asked zacharias smith superciliously having cornered harry in the entrance hall after lunch good lord you must be terrible snape usually give extra lessons does he 
 
 as smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion ron glared after him 
 
 shall i jinx him i can still get him from here he said raising his wand and taking aim between shoulder blades 
 
 forget it said harry dismally what going to think it that really stup 
 
 hi harry said a voice behind him he turned round and found cho standing there 
 
 oh said harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably hi 
 
 be in the library harry said hermione firmly as she seized ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase 
 
 had a good christmas asked cho 
 
 yeah not bad said harry 
 
 mine was pretty quiet said cho for some reason she was looking rather embarrassed erm another hogsmeade trip next month did you see the notice 
 
 what oh no i checked the noticeboard since i got back 
 
 yes on valentines day 
 
 right said harry wondering why she was telling him this well i suppose you want to 
 
 only if you do she said eagerly 
 
 harry stared he had been about to say i suppose you want to know when the next da meeting is but her response did not seem to fit 
 
 ier he said 
 
 oh ok if you she said looking mortified worry see you around 
 
 she walked away harry stood staring after her his brain working frantically then something clunked into place 
 
 cho heycho 
 
 he ran after her catching her halfway up the marble staircase 
 
 want to come into hogsmeade with me on day 
 
 oooh yes she said blushing crimson and beaming at him 
 
 right well settled then said harry and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up ron and hermione before their afternoon lessons 
 
 by six that evening however even the glow of having successfully asked out cho chang could not lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step harry took towards office 
 
 he paused outside the door when he reached it wishing he were almost anywhere else then taking a deep breath he knocked and entered 
 
 the shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions in one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that snape had once accused harrynot without reasonof robbing attention was drawn towards the desk however where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight harry recognised it at onceit was pensieve wondering what on earth it was doing there he jumped when cold voice came out of the shadows 
 
 shut the door behind you potter 
 
 harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself when he turned back into the room snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk harry sat down and so did snape his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon harry dislike etched in every line of his face 
 
 well potter you know why you are here he said the headmaster has asked me to teach you occlumency i can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at potions 
 
 right said harry tersely 
 
 this may not be an ordinary class potter said snape his eyes narrowed malevolently but i am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or professor at all times 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment then said now occlumency as i told you back in your dear kitchen this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence 
 
 and why does professor dumbledore think i need it sir said harry looking directly into eyes and wondering whether snape would answer 
 
 snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously surely even you could have worked that out by now potter the dark lord is highly skilled at legilimency 
 
 that sir 
 
 it is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another mind 
 
 he can read minds said harry quickly his worst fears confirmed 
 
 you have no subtlety potter said snape his dark eyes glittering you do not understand fine distinctions it is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable 
 
 snape paused for a moment apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting harry before continuing 
 
 only muggles talk of the mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls to be perused by any invader the mind is a complex and thing potter or at least most minds are he smirked it is true however that those who have mastered legilimency are able under certain conditions to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly the dark lord for instance almost always knows when somebody is lying to him only those skilled at occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection 
 
 whatever snape said legilimency sounded like to harry and he like the sound of it at all 
 
 so he could know what thinking right now sir 
 
 the dark lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them said snape time and space matter in magic potter eye contact is often essential to legilimency 
 
 well then why do i have to learn occlumency 
 
 snape eyed harry tracing his mouth with one long thin finger as he did so 
 
 the usual rules do not seem to apply with you potter the curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the dark lord the evidence suggests that at times when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable when you are asleep for instanceyou are sharing the dark thoughts and emotions the headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue he wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the dark lord 
 
 heart was pumping fast again none of this added up 
 
 but why does professor dumbledore want to stop it he asked abruptly i like it much but been useful it i mean i saw that snake attack mr weasley and if i professor dumbledore have been able to save him would he sir 
 
 snape stared at harry for a few moments still tracing his mouth with his finger when he spoke again it was slowly and deliberately as though he weighed every word 
 
 it appears that the dark lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser however the vision you had shortly before christmas 
 
 the one with the snake and mr weasley 
 
 do not interrupt me potter said snape in a dangerous voice as i was saying the vision you had shortly before christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the dark thoughts 
 
 i saw inside the head not his 
 
 i thought i just told you not to interrupt me potter 
 
 but harry did not care if snape was angry at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business he had moved forwards in his chair so that without realising it he was perched on the very edge tense as though poised for flight 
 
 how come i saw through the eyes if thoughts sharing 
 
 do not say the dark name spat snape 
 
 there was a nasty silence they glared at each other across the pensieve 
 
 professor dumbledore says his name said harry quietly 
 
 dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard snape muttered while he may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of us he rubbed his left forearm apparently unconsciously on the spot where harry knew the dark mark was burned into his skin 
 
 i just wanted to know harry began again forcing his voice back to politeness why 
 
 you seem to have visited the mind because that was where the dark lord was at that particular moment snarled snape he was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too 
 
 and volhe realised i was there 
 
 it seems so said snape coolly 
 
 how do you know said harry urgently is this just professor dumbledore guessing or 
 
 i told you said snape rigid in his chair his eyes slits to call me sir 
 
 yes sir said harry impatiently but how do you know 
 
 it is enough that we know said snape repressively the important point is that the dark lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings he has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse that is to say he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return 
 
 and he might try and make me do things asked harry sir he added hurriedly 
 
 he might said snape sounding cold and unconcerned which brings us back to occlumency 
 
 snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and harry tensed in his chair but snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair when he withdrew it some silvery substance came away stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the pensieve where it swirled neither gas nor liquid twice more snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin then without offering any explanation of his behaviour he picked up the pensieve carefully removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face harry with his wand held at the ready 
 
 stand up and take out your wand potter 
 
 harry got to his feet feeling nervous they faced each other with the desk between them 
 
 you may use your wand to attempt to disarm me or defend yourself in any other way you can think of said snape 
 
 and what are you going to do harry asked eyeing wand apprehensively 
 
 i am about to attempt to break into your mind said snape softly we are going to see how well you resist i have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the imperius curse you will find that similar powers are needed for this brace yourself now legilimens 
 
 snape had struck before harry was ready before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance the office swam in front of his eyes and vanished image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings 
 
 he was five watching dudley riding a new red bicycle and his heart was bursting with jealousy he was nine and ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the dursleys were laughing below on the lawn he was sitting under the sorting hat and it was telling him he would do well in slytherin hermione was lying in the hospital wing her face covered with thick black hair a hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake cho chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe 
 
 no said a voice inside head as the memory of cho drew nearer not watching that not watching it private 
 
 he felt a sharp pain in his knee office had come back into view and he realised that he had fallen to the floor one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of desk he looked up at snape who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist there was an angry weal there like a scorch mark 
 
 did you mean to produce a stinging hex asked snape coolly 
 
 no said harry bitterly getting up from the floor 
 
 i thought not said snape watching him closely you let me get in too far you lost control 
 
 did you see everything i saw harry asked unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer 
 
 flashes of it said snape his lip curling to whom did the dog belong 
 
 my aunt marge harry muttered hating snape 
 
 well for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been said snape raising his wand once more you managed to stop me eventually though you wasted time and energy shouting you must remain focused repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand 
 
 trying said harry angrily but not telling me how 
 
 manners potter said snape dangerously now i want you to close your eyes 
 
 harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told he did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while snape faced him carrying a wand 
 
 clear your mind potter said cold voice let go of all emotion 
 
 but anger at snape continued to pound through his veins like venom let go of his anger he could as easily detach his legs 
 
 not doing it potter you will need more discipline than this focus now 
 
 harry tried to empty his mind tried not to think or remember or feel 
 
 go again on the count of three onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a great black dragon was rearing in front of him his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror cedric diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 harry was on his knees again his face buried in his hands his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull 
 
 get up said snape sharply get up you are not trying you are making no effort you are allowing me access to memories you fear handing me weapons 
 
 harry stood up again his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen cedric dead in the graveyard snape looked paler than usual and angrier though not nearly as angry as harry was 
 
 iammaking aneffort he said through clenched teeth 
 
 i told you to empty yourself of emotion 
 
 yeah well finding that hard at the moment harry snarled 
 
 then you will find yourself easy prey for the dark lord said snape savagely fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves who cannot control their emotions who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easilyweak people in other wordsthey stand no chance against his powers he will penetrate your mind with absurd ease potter 
 
 i am not weak said harry in a low voice fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack snape in a moment 
 
 then prove it master yourself spat snape control your anger discipline your mind we shall try again get ready now legilimens 
 
 he was watching uncle vernon hammering the letterbox shut a hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him he was running along a windowless passage with mr weasley they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor harry expected to go through it but mr weasley led him off to the left down a flight of stone steps 
 
 i know i know 
 
 he was on all fours again on office floor his scar was prickling unpleasantly but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant he pushed himself up again to find snape storing at him his wand raised it looked as though this time snape had lifted the spell before harry had even tried to fight back 
 
 what happened then potter he asked eyeing harry intently 
 
 i sawi remembered harry panted just realised 
 
 realised what asked snape sharply 
 
 harry did not answer at once he was still savouring the moment of blinding realisation as he rubbed his forehead 
 
 he had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months without once realising that it was a real place now seeing the memory again he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with mr weasley on the twelfth of august as they hurried to the courtrooms in the ministry it was the corridor leading to the department of mysteries and mr weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by snake 
 
 he looked up at snape 
 
 in the department of mysteries 
 
 what did you say snape asked quietly and harry saw with deep satisfaction that snape was unnerved 
 
 i said in the department of mysteries sir harry said 
 
 and why said snape slowly would you ask such a thing 
 
 because said harry watching face closely that corridor just been dreaming about it for just recognised itit leads to the department of mysteries and i think voldemort wants something from 
 
 i have told you not to say the dark name 
 
 they glared at each other scar seared again but he did not care snape looked agitated but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned 
 
 there are many things in the department of mysteries potter few of which you would understand and none of which concern you do i make myself plain 
 
 yes harry said still rubbing his prickling scar which was becoming more painful 
 
 i want you back here same time on wednesday we will continue work then 
 
 fine said harry he was desperate to get out of office and find ron and hermione 
 
 you are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep empty it make it blank and calm you understand 
 
 yes said harry who was barely listening 
 
 and be warned potter i shall know if you have not practised 
 
 right harry mumbled he picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door as he opened it he glanced back at snape who had his back to harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head harry left without another word closing the door carefully behind him his scar still throbbing painfully 
 
 harry found ron and hermione in the library where they were working on most recent ream of homework other students nearly all of them sat at tables nearby noses close to books quills scratching feverishly while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker the only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of madam shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books 
 
 harry felt shivery his scar was still aching he felt almost feverish 
 
 when he sat down opposite ron and hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual 
 
 how did it go hermione whispered and then looking concerned are you all right harry 
 
 yeah fine i dunno said harry impatiently wincing as pain shot through his scar again listen just realised something 
 
 and he told them what he had just seen and deduced 
 
 so so are you saying whispered ron as madam pince swept past squeaking slightly that the weaponthe thing afteris in the ministry of magic 
 
 in the department of mysteries got to be harry whispered i saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him 
 
 hermione let out a long slow sigh 
 
 of course she breathed 
 
 of course what said ron rather impatiently 
 
 ron think about it sturgis podmore was trying to get through a door at the ministry of magic it must have been that one too much of a coincidence 
 
 how come sturgis was trying to break in when on our side said ron 
 
 well i know hermione admitted that is a bit odd 
 
 so in the department of mysteries harry asked ron has your dad ever mentioned anything about it 
 
 i know they call the people who work in there unspeakables said ron frowning because no one really seems to know what they doweird place to have a weapon 
 
 not weird at all it makes perfect sense said hermione it will be something top secret that the ministry has been developing i expect harry are you sure all right 
 
 for harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it 
 
 yeah fine he said lowering his hands which were trembling i just feel a bit i like occlumency much 
 
 i expect anyone would feel snaky if had their mind attacked over and over again said hermione sympathetically look get back to the common room be a bit more comfortable there 
 
 but the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement fred and george were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise 
 
 headless hats shouted george as fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students two galleons each watch fred now 
 
 fred swept the hat on to his head beaming for a second he merely looked rather stupid then both hat and head vanished 
 
 several girls screamed but everyone else was roaring with laughter 
 
 and off again shouted george and hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder then his head reappeared as he swept the hat from it 
 
 how do those hats work then said hermione distracted from her homework and watching fred and george closely i mean obviously some kind of invisibility spell but rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object imagine the charm have a very long life though 
 
 harry did not answer he was feeling ill 
 
 going to have to do this tomorrow he muttered pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it 
 
 well write it in your homework planner then said hermione encouragingly so you forget 
 
 harry and ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively 
 
 leave it till later you big chided the book as harry scribbled down homework hermione beamed at it 
 
 i think go to bed said harry stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got 
 
 he walked across the common room dodging george who tried to put a headless hat on him and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys dormitories he was feeling sick again just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right 
 
 he opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head he did not know where be was whether he was standing or lying down he did not even know his own name 
 
 maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears he was happier than he had been in a very long time jubilant ecstatic triumphant a wonderful wonderful thing had happened 
 
 harry harry 
 
 someone had hit him around the face the insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain the happiness was draining out of him but the laughter continued 
 
 he opened his eyes and as he did so he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth the moment he realised this it died away harry lay panting on the floor staring up at the ceiling the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly ron was bending over him looking very worried 
 
 what happened he said 
 
 i dunno harry gasped sitting up again really happy really happy 
 
 is 
 
 something happened mumbled harry he was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack mr weasley and felt very sick something been hoping for 
 
 the words came just as they had back in the gryffindor changing room as though a stranger was speaking them through mouth yet he knew they were true he took deep breaths willing himself not to vomit all over ron he was very glad that dean and seamus were not here to watch this time 
 
 hermione told me to come and check on you said ron in a low voice helping harry to his feet she says your defences will be low at the moment after been fiddling around with your mind still i suppose help in the long run it he looked doubtfully at harry as he helped him towards his bed harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening his scar still prickling painfully he could not help feeling that his first foray into occlumency had weakened his resistance rather than strengthening it and he wondered with a feeling of great trepidation what had happened to make lord voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years
