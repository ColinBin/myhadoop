 but why you got occlumency lessons any more said hermione frowning 
 
 told you harry muttered snape reckons i can carry on by myself now got the basics 
 
 so stopped having funny dreams said hermione sceptically 
 
 pretty much said harry not looking at her 
 
 well i think snape should stop until absolutely sure you can control them said hermione indignantly harry i think you should go back to him and ask 
 
 no said harry forcefully just drop it hermione ok 
 
 it was the first day of the easter holidays and hermione as was her custom had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them harry and ron had let her do it it was easier than arguing with her and in any case they might come in useful 
 
 ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams 
 
 how can that come as a shock hermione demanded as she tapped each little square on timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject 
 
 i dunno said ron been a lot going on 
 
 well there you are she said handing him his timetable if you follow that you should do fine 
 
 ron looked down it gloomily but then brightened 
 
 given me an evening off every week 
 
 for quidditch practice said hermione 
 
 the smile faded from face 
 
 the point he said dully got about as much chance of winning the quidditch cup this year as got of becoming minister for magic 
 
 hermione said nothing she was looking at harry who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while crookshanks pawed at his hand trying to get his ears scratched 
 
 wrong harry 
 
 what he said quickly nothing 
 
 he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under chair 
 
 i saw cho earlier said hermione tentatively she looked really miserable too have you two had a row again 
 
 whaoh yeah we have said harry seizing gratefully on the excuse 
 
 what about 
 
 that sneak friend of hers marietta said harry 
 
 yeah well i blame you said ron angrily setting down his revision timetable if it been for her 
 
 ron went into a rant about marietta edgecombe which harry found helpful all he had to do was look angry nod and say yeah and right whenever ron drew breath leaving his mind free to dwell ever more miserably on what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 he felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside he had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions snape cast on his character people like hagrid and sirius told harry how wonderful his father had been yeah well look what sirius was like himself said a nagging voice inside head he was as bad he yes he had once overheard professor mcgonagall saying that his father and sirius had been troublemakers at school but she had described them as forerunners of the weasley twins and harry could not imagine fred and george dangling someone for the fun of it not unless they really loathed them perhaps malfoy or somebody who really deserved it 
 
 harry tried to make a case for snape having deserved what he had suffered at hands but lily asked he done to you and james replied more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean james started it all simply because sirius had said he was bored harry remembered lupin saying back in grimmauld place that dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over james and sirius but in the pensieve he had sat there and let it all happen 
 
 harry kept reminding himself that lily had intervened his mother had been decent yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at james disturbed him quite as much as anything else she had clearly loathed james and harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married once or twice he even wondered whether james had forced her into it 
 
 for nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration whenever someone had told him he was like james he had glowed with pride inside and now now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him 
 
 the weather grew breezier brighter and warmer as the easter holidays passed but harry along with the rest of the fifth and was trapped inside revising traipsing back and forth to the library harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams and as his fellow gryffindors were sick of studying themselves his excuse went unchallenged 
 
 harry talking to you can you hear me 
 
 huh 
 
 he looked round ginny weasley looking very windswept had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone it was late on sunday evening hermione had gone back to gryffindor tower to revise ancient runes and ron had quidditch practice 
 
 oh hi said harry pulling his books towards him how come not at practice 
 
 over said ginny ron had to take jack sloper up to the hospital wing 
 
 why 
 
 well not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat she sighed heavily anyway a package just arrived only just got through new screening process 
 
 she hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly there was a scribbled note across it in red ink reading inspected and passed by the hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 easter eggs from mum said ginny one for you there you go 
 
 she handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small iced snitches and according to the packaging containing a bag of fizzing whizzbees harry looked at it for a moment then to his horror felt a lump rise in his throat 
 
 are you ok harry ginny asked quietly 
 
 yeah fine said harry gruffly the lump in his throat was painful he did not understand why an easter egg should have made him feel like this 
 
 you seem really down lately ginny persisted you know sure if you just talked to cho 
 
 not cho i want to talk to said harry brusquely 
 
 who is it then asked ginny watching him closely 
 
 i 
 
 he glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening madam pince was several shelves away stamping out a pile cf books for a hannah abbott 
 
 i wish i could talk to sirius he muttered but i know i 
 
 ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully more to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any harry unwrapped his easter egg broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth 
 
 well said ginny slowly helping herself to a bit of egg too if you really want to talk to sirius i expect we could think of a way to do it 
 
 come on said harry dully with umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail 
 
 the thing about growing up with fred and george said ginny thoughtfully is that you sort of start thinking possible if got enough nerve 
 
 harry looked at her perhaps it was the effect of the chocolatelupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementorsor simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week but he felt a bit more hopeful 
 
 what do you think you are doing 
 
 oh damn whispered ginny jumping to her feet i forgot 
 
 madam pince was swooping down on them her shrivelled face contorted with rage 
 
 chocolate in the library she screamed outoutout and whipping out her wand she caused books bag and ink bottle to chase him and ginny from the library whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran 
 
 as though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations a batch of pamphlets leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in gryffindor tower shortly before the end of the holidays along with yet another notice on the board which read 
 
 careers advice 
 
 all are required to attend a short meeting with their 
 
 head of house during the first week of the summer term to discuss 
 
 their future careers times of individual appointments are listed below 
 
 
 
 harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in professor office at half past two on monday which would mean missing most of divination he and the other spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal 
 
 well i fancy healing said ron on the last evening of the holidays he was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed emblem of st on its front it says here you need at least e at newt level in potions herbology transfiguration charms and defence against the dark arts i mean blimey want much do they 
 
 well a very responsible job it said hermione absently 
 
 she was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet that was headed so you think like to work in muggle relations you seem to need many qualifications to liaise with muggles all they want is an owl in muggle studies much more important is your enthusiasm patience and a good sense of fun 
 
 need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle said harry darkly good sense of when to duck more like he was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking listen to this are you seeking a challenging career involving travel adventure and substantial treasure bonuses then consider a position with gringotts wizarding bank who are currently recruiting for thrilling opportunities abroad they want arithmancy though you could do it hermione 
 
 i much fancy banking said hermione vaguely now immersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls 
 
 hey said a voice in ear he looked round fred and george had come to join them had a word with us about you said fred stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the ministry of magic to slide off on to the floor she says you need to talk to sirius 
 
 what said hermione sharply freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up make a bang at the department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 yeah said harry trying to sound casual yeah i thought like 
 
 be so ridiculous said hermione straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes with umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls 
 
 well we think we can find a way around that said george stretching and smiling a simple matter of causing a diversion now you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the easter holidays 
 
 what was the point we asked ourselves of disrupting leisure time continued fred no point at all we answered ourselves and of course have messed up revision too which would be the very last thing want to do 
 
 he gave hermione a sanctimonious little nod she looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness 
 
 but business as usual from tomorrow fred continued briskly and if going to be causing a bit of uproar why not do it so that harry can have his chat with sirius 
 
 yes but still said hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse even if you do cause a diversion how is harry supposed to talk to him 
 
 office said harry quietly 
 
 he had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own 
 
 areyou insane said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily 
 
 i think so said harry shrugging 
 
 and how are you going to get in there in the first place 
 
 harry was ready for this question 
 
 knife he said 
 
 excuse me 
 
 christmas before last sirius gave me a knife open any lock said harry so even if bewitched the door so alahomora work which i bet she has 
 
 what do you think about this hermione demanded of ron and harry was reminded irresistibly of mrs weasley appealing to her husband during first dinner in grimmauld place 
 
 i dunno said ron looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion if harry wants to do it up to him it 
 
 spoken like a true friend and weasley said fred clapping ron hard on the back right then thinking of doing it tomorrow just after lessons because it should cause maximum impact in in the corridorsharry set it off in the east wing somewhere draw her right away from her own officei reckon we should be able to guarantee you what twenty minutes he said looking at george 
 
 easy said george 
 
 what sort of diversion is it asked ron 
 
 see little bro said fred as he and george got up again at least you will if you trot along to gregory the corridor round about five tomorrow 
 
 harry awoke very early the next day feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic it was not only the prospect of breaking into office and using her fire to speak to sirius that was making him feel nervous though that was certainly bad enough today also happened to be the first time harry would be in close proximity to snape since snape had thrown him out of his office 
 
 after lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside bed and stared out on a truly glorious morning the sky was a clear misty opalescent blue directly ahead of him harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented snape he was not sure what sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the pensieve but he was desperate to hear own account of what had happened to know of any mitigating factors there might have been any excuse at all for his behaviour 
 
 something caught attention movement on the edge of the forbidden forest harry squinted into the sun and saw hagrid emerging from between the trees he seemed to be limping as harry watched hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it harry watched the cabin for several minutes hagrid did not emerge again but smoke furled from the chimney so hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire 
 
 harry turned away from the window headed back to his trunk and started to dress 
 
 with the prospect of forcing entry into office ahead harry had never expected the day to be a restful one but he had not reckoned on almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five for the first time ever she was at least as inattentive to professor binns in history of magic as harry and ron were keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that harry tried very hard to ignore 
 
 and if she does catch you there apart from being expelled be able to guess been talking to snuffles and this time i expect force you to drink veritaserum and answer her questions 
 
 hermione said ron in a low and indignant voice are you going to stop telling harry off and listen to binns or am i going to have to take my own notes 
 
 you take notes for a change it kill you 
 
 by the time they reached the dungeons neither harry nor ron was speaking to hermione undeterred she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks 
 
 snape meanwhile seemed to have decided to act as though harry were invisible harry was of course to this tactic as it was one of uncle favourites and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse in fact compared to what he usually had to endure from snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone he was able to concoct an invigoration draught quite easily at the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an e 
 
 he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter harry whipped around his potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure 
 
 whoops he said softly another zero then potter 
 
 harry was too incensed to speak he strode back to his cauldron intending to fill another flask and force snape to mark it but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished 
 
 sorry said hermione with her hands over her mouth really sorry harry i thought finished so i cleared up 
 
 harry could not bring himself to answer when the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between neville and seamus for lunch so that hermione could not start nagging him again about using office 
 
 he was in such a bad mood by the time he got to divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with professor mcgonagall remembering it only when ron asked him why he in her office he hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath only a few minutes late 
 
 sorry professor he panted as he closed the door i forgot 
 
 no matter potter she said briskly but as she spoke somebody else sniffed from the corner harry looked round 
 
 professor umbridge was sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face 
 
 sit down potter said professor mcgonagall tersely her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk 
 
 harry sat down with his back to umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard 
 
 well potter this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years said professor mcgonagall have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave hogwarts 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting 
 
 yes professor mcgonagall prompted harry 
 
 well i thought of maybe being an auror harry mumbled 
 
 need top grades for that said professor mcgonagall extracting a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it they ask for a minimum of five newts and nothing under exceeds expectations grade i see then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the auror office a difficult career path potter they only take the best in fact i think anybody has been taken on in the last three years 
 
 at this moment professor umbridge gave a very tiny cough as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it professor mcgonagall ignored her 
 
 want to know which subjects you ought to take i suppose she went on talking a little louder than before 
 
 yes said harry defence against the dark arts i suppose 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall crisply i would also advise 
 
 professor umbridge gave another cough a little more audible this time professor mcgonagall closed her eyes for a moment opened them again and continued as though nothing had happened 
 
 i would also advise transfiguration because aurors frequently need to transfigure or untransfigure in their work and i ought to tell you now potter that i do not accept students into my newt classes unless they have achieved exceeds expectations or higher at ordinary wizarding level say averaging acceptable at the moment so need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing then you ought to do charms always useful and potions yes potter potions she added with the merest flicker of a smile poisons and antidotes are essential study for aurors and i must tell you that professor snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than outstanding in their owls so 
 
 professor umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet 
 
 may i offer you a cough drop dolores professor mcgonagall asked curtly without looking at professor umbridge 
 
 oh no thank you very much said umbridge with that simpering laugh harry hated so much i just wondered whether i could make the teensiest interruption minerva 
 
 i daresay find you can said professor mcgonagall through tightly gritted teeth 
 
 i was just wondering whether mr potter has quite the temperament for an auror said professor umbridge sweetly 
 
 were you said professor mcgonagall haughtily well potter she continued as though there had been no interruption if you are serious in this ambition i would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your transfiguration and potions up to scratch i see professor flitwick has graded you between acceptable and exceeds expectations for the last two years so your charmwork seems satisfactory as for defence against the dark arts your marks have been generally high professor lupin in particular thought youare you quite sure you like a cough drop dolores 
 
 oh no need thank you minerva simpered professor umbridge who had just coughed her loudest yet i was just concerned that you might not have most recent defence against the dark arts marks in front of you quite sure i slipped in a note 
 
 what this thing said professor mcgonagall in a tone of revulsion as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of folder she glanced down it her eyebrows slightly raised then placed it back into the folder without comment 
 
 yes as i was saying potter professor lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject and obviously for an auror 
 
 did you not understand my note minerva asked professor umbndge in honeyed tones quite forgetting to cough 
 
 of course i understood it said professor mcgonagall her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled 
 
 well then i am confused afraid i quite understand how you can give mr potter false hope that 
 
 false hope repeated professor mcgonagall still refusing to look round at professor umbridge he has achieved high marks in all his defence against the dark arts tests 
 
 terribly sorry to have to contradict you minerva but as you will see from my note harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me 
 
 i should have made my meaning plainer said professor mcgonagall turning at last to look umbridge directly in the eyes he has achieved high marks in all defence against the dark arts tests set by a competent teacher 
 
 professor smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing she sat back in her chair turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed her bulging eyes rolling from side to side professor mcgonagall turned back to harry her thin nostrils flared her eyes burning 
 
 any questions potter 
 
 yes said harry what sort of character and aptitude tests do the ministry do on you if you get enough newts 
 
 well need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth said professor mcgonagall perseverance and dedication because auror training takes a further three years not to mention very high skills in practical defence it will mean a lot more study even after left school so unless prepared to 
 
 i think also find said umbridge her voice very cold now that the ministry looks into the records of those applying to be aurors their criminal records 
 
 unless prepared to take even more exams after hogwarts you should really look at another 
 
 which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an auror as dumbledore has of ever returning to this school 
 
 a very good chance then said professor mcgonagall 
 
 potter has a criminal record said umbridge loudly 
 
 potter has been cleared of all charges said mcgonagall even more loudly 
 
 professor umbridge stood up she was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference but her fussy simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad flabby face look oddly sinister 
 
 potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an auror 
 
 professor mcgonagall got to her feet too and in her case this was a much more impressive move she towered over professor umbridge 
 
 potter she said in ringing tones i will assist you to become an auror if it is the last thing i do if i have to coach you nightly i will make sure you achieve the required results 
 
 the minister for magic will never employ harry potter said umbridge her voice rising furiously 
 
 there may well be a new minister for magic by the time potter is ready to join shouted professor mcgonagall 
 
 aha shrieked professor umbridge pointing a stubby linger at mcgonagall yes yes yes yes of course what you want it minerva mcgonagall you want cornelius fudge replaced by albus dumbledore you think be where i am you senior undersecretary to the minister and headmistress to boot 
 
 you are raving said professor mcgonagall superbly disdainful potter that concludes our careers consultation 
 
 harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at professor umbridge he could hear her and professor mcgonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor 
 
 professor umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their defence against the dark arts lesson that afternoon 
 
 i hope thought better of what you were planning to do harry hermione whispered the moment they had opened their books to chapter and negotiation umbridge looks like in a really bad mood already 
 
 every now and then umbridge shot glowering looks at harry who kept his head down staring at defensive magical theory his eyes unfocused thinking 
 
 he could just imagine professor reaction if he was caught trespassing in professor office mere hours after she had vouched for him there was nothing to stop him simply going back to gryffindor tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the pensieve nothing except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach and then there was the matter of fred and george whose diversion was already planned not to mention the knife sirius had given him which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his old invisibility cloak 
 
 but the fact remained that if he was caught 
 
 dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school harry whispered hermione raising her book to hide her face from umbridge and if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing 
 
 he could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a day more than twenty years ago 
 
 and then he remembered sirius in the fire upstairs in the gryffindor common room 
 
 less like your father than i thought the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 but did he want to be like his father any more 
 
 harry do it please do it hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class 
 
 he did not answer he did not know what to do 
 
 ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice he would not look at harry though when hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading harry some more he said in a low voice give it a rest ok he can make up his own mind 
 
 heart beat very fast as he left the classroom he was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance there were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them people exiting the classrooms all around harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully 
 
 umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction it was now or never 
 
 harryplease hermione pleaded weakly 
 
 but he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing 
 
 harry reached the corridor to office and found it deserted dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized knife and donned the invisibility cloak he then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached door 
 
 he inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it there was a tiny click and the door swung open he ducked inside the office closed the door quickly behind him and looked around 
 
 nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks 
 
 harry pulled off his cloak and striding over to the fireplace found what he was looking for within seconds a small box containing glittering floo powder 
 
 he crouched down in front of the empty grate his hands shaking he had never done this before though he thought he knew how it must work sticking his head into the fireplace he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him they exploded at once into emerald green flames 
 
 number twelve grimmauld place harry said loudly and clearly 
 
 it was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced he had travelled by floo powder before of course but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country this time his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of office and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire 
 
 and then as abruptly as it had begun the spinning stopped feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long wooden table where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment 
 
 sirius 
 
 the man jumped and looked around it was not sirius but lupin 
 
 harry he said looking thoroughly shocked what are happened is everything all right 
 
 yeah said harry i just wonderedi mean i just fancied aa chat with sirius 
 
 call him said lupin getting to his feet still looking perplexed he went upstairs to look for kreacher he seems to be hiding in the attic again 
 
 and harry saw lupin hurry out of the kitchen now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs he wondered why sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with hard stone floor 
 
 lupin returned with sirius at his heels moments later 
 
 what is it said sirius urgently sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire so that he and harry were on a level lupin knelt down too looking very concerned are you all right do you need help 
 
 no said harry nothing like that i just wanted to talk about my dad 
 
 they exchanged a look of great surprise but harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion george had only guaranteed him twenty he therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 when he had finished neither sirius nor lupin spoke for a moment then lupin said quietly i like you to judge your father on what you saw there harry he was only fifteen 
 
 fifteen said harry heatedly 
 
 look harry said sirius placatingly james and snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other it was just one of those things you can understand that you i think james was everything snape wanted to behe was popular he was good at quidditchgood at pretty much everything and snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the dark arts and jameswhatever else he may have appeared to you harryalways hated the dark arts 
 
 yeah said harry but he just attacked snape for no good reason just becausewell just because you said you were bored he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice 
 
 i m not proud of it said sirius quickly 
 
 lupin looked sideways at sirius then said look harry what got to understand is that your father and sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did everyone thought they were the height of coolif they sometimes got a bit carried away 
 
 if we were sometimes arrogant little berks you mean said sirius 
 
 lupin smiled 
 
 he kept messing up his hair said harry in a pained voice 
 
 sirius and lupin laughed 
 
 forgotten he used to do that said sirius affectionately 
 
 was he playing with the snitch said lupin eagerly 
 
 yeah said harry watching uncomprehendingly as sirius and lupin beamed reminiscently well i thought he was a bit of an idiot 
 
 of course he was a bit of an idiot said sirius bracingly we were all idiots well not moony so much he said fairly looking at lupin 
 
 but lupin shook his head did i ever tell you to lay off snape he said did i ever have the guts to tell you i thought you were out of order 
 
 yeah well said sirius you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes that was something 
 
 and said harry doggedly determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here he kept looking over at the girls by the lake hoping they were watching him 
 
 oh well he always made a fool of himself whenever lily was around said sirius shrugging he stop himself showing off whenever he got near her 
 
 how come she married him harry asked miserably she hated him 
 
 nah she said sirius 
 
 she started going out with him in seventh year said lupin 
 
 once james had deflated his head a bit said sirius 
 
 and stopped hexing people just for the fun of it said lupin 
 
 even snape said harry 
 
 well said lupin slowly snape was a special case i mean he never lost an opportunity to curse james so you really expect james to take that lying down could you 
 
 and my mum was ok with that 
 
 she know too much about it to tell you the truth said sirius i mean james take snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her did he 
 
 sirius frowned at harry who was still looking unconvinced 
 
 look he said your father was the best friend i ever had and he was a good person a lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen he grew out of it 
 
 yeah ok said harry heavily i just never thought feel sorry for snape 
 
 now you mention it said lupin a faint crease between his eyebrows how did snape react when he found seen all this 
 
 he told me never teach me occlumency again said harry indifferently like a big disappoint 
 
 he what shouted sirius causing harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes 
 
 are you serious harry said lupin quickly stopped giving you lessons 
 
 yeah said harry surprised at what he considered a great but ok i care a bit of a relief to tell you the 
 
 coming up there to have a word with snape said sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up but lupin wrenched him back down again 
 
 if going to tell snape it will be me he said firmly but harry first of all to go back to snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessonswhen dumbledore hears 
 
 i tell him that kill me said harry outraged you see him when we got out of the pensieve 
 
 harry there is nothing so important as you learning occlumency said lupin sternly do you understand me nothing 
 
 ok ok said harry thoroughly discomposed not to mention annoyed try and say something to him but it be 
 
 he fell silent he could hear distant footsteps 
 
 is that kreacher coming downstairs 
 
 no said sirius glancing behind him it must be somebody your end 
 
 heart skipped several beats 
 
 better go he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the grimmauld place fire for a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders then he found himself kneeling in front of fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die 
 
 quickly quickly he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door ah left it open 
 
 harry dived for the invisibility cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when filch burst into the office he looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room pulled open a drawer in desk and began rifling through the papers inside it 
 
 approval for whipping approval for whipping i can do it at last had it coming to them for years 
 
 he pulled out a piece of parchment kissed it then shuffled rapidly back out of the door clutching it to his chest 
 
 harry leapt to his feet and making sure he had his bag and that the invisibility cloak was completely covering him he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after filch who was hobbling along faster than harry had ever seen him go 
 
 one landing down from office harry thought it was safe to become visible again he pulled off the cloak shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards there was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall he ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there 
 
 it was just like the night when trelawney had been sacked students were standing all around the walls in a great ring some of them harry noticed covered in a substance that looked very like stinksap teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd prominent among the onlookers were members of the inquisitorial squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and peeves who was bobbing overhead gazed down at fred and george who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered 
 
 so said umbridge triumphantly harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him once more looking down upon her prey soyou think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you 
 
 pretty amusing yeah said fred looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear 
 
 filch elbowed his way closer to umbridge almost crying with happiness 
 
 got the form headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment harry had just seen him take from her desk got the form and got the whips waiting oh let me do it now 
 
 very good argus she said you two she went on gazing down at fred and george are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school 
 
 you know what said fred i think we are 
 
 he turned to his twin 
 
 george said fred i think outgrown education 
 
 yeah been feeling that way myself said george lightly 
 
 time to test our talents in the real world reckon asked fred 
 
 definitely said george 
 
 and before umbridge could say a word they raised their wands and said together 
 
 accio brooms 
 
 harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance looking to his left he ducked just in time fred and broomsticks one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which umbridge had fastened them to the wall were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners they turned left streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor 
 
 we be seeing you fred told professor umbridge swinging his leg over his broomstick 
 
 yeah bother to keep in touch said george mounting his own 
 
 fred looked around at the assembled students at the silent watchful crowd 
 
 it anyone fancies buying a portable swamp as demonstrated upstairs come to number diagon wizarding wheezes he said in a loud voice our new premises 
 
 special discounts to students who swear going to use our products to get rid of this old bat added george pointing at professor umbridge 
 
 stop them shrieked umbridge but it was too late as the inquisitorial squad closed in fred and george kicked off from the floor shooting fifteen feet into the air the iron peg swinging dangerously below fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd 
 
 give her hell from us peeves 
 
 and peeves who harry had never seen take an order from a student before swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as fred and george wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
