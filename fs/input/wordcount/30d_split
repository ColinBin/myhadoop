lionfish nov chapter thirty grawpcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the story of fred and flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of legend within a week even those who had been were they had seen the twins umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with dungbombs before zooming out of the doors in the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them harry frequently heard students saying things like honestly some days i just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley 
 
 fred and george had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon for one thing they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing umbridge and filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success eventually the area was roped off and filch gnashing his teeth furiously was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms harry was certain that teachers like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just as in the case of fred and wildfire they seemed to prefer to watch umbridge struggle 
 
 then there were the two large holes in office door through which fred and cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters filch fitted a new door and removed firebolt to the dungeons where it was rumoured umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it however her troubles were far from over 
 
 inspired by fred and example a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of in spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a niffler into office which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects leapt on umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers dungbombs and stink pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform charms on themselves before leaving lessons which ensured them a supply of fresh air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing goldfish bowls on their heads 
 
 filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands desperate to catch miscreants but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn the inquisitorial squad was attempting to help him but odd things kept happening to its members warrington of the slytherin quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes pansy parkinson to delight missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers 
 
 meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes fred and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from umbridgeitis after putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves 
 
 but not even the users of the snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos peeves who seemed to have taken parting words deeply to heart cackling madly he soared through the school upending tables bursting out of blackboards toppling statues and vases twice he shut mrs norris inside a suit of armour from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the great hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hours at a time floating along after umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke 
 
 none of the staff but filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her indeed a week after fred and departure harry witnessed professor mcgonagall walking right past peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth it unscrews the other way 
 
 to cap matters montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry 
 
 should we say something said hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the charms window so that she could see mr and mrs montague marching inside about what happened to him in case it helps madam pomfrey cure him 
 
 course not recover said ron indifferently 
 
 anyway more trouble for umbridge it said harry in a satisfied voice 
 
 he and ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few seconds then folded causing the cup to crack into two 
 
 reparo said hermione quickly mending cup with a wave of her wand all very well but what if permanently injured 
 
 who cares said ron irritably while his teacup stood up drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees montague have tried to take all those points from gryffindor should he if you want to worry about anyone hermione worry about me 
 
 you she said catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little legs and replacing it in front of her why should i be worried about you 
 
 when next letter finally gets through screening process said ron bitterly now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight going to be in deep trouble i be surprised if sent another howler 
 
 but 
 
 be my fault fred and george left you wait said ron darkly say i stopped them leaving i grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something yeah be all my fault 
 
 well if she say that be very unfair you have done anything but sure she i mean if really true got premises in diagon alley they must have been planning this for ages 
 
 yeah but another thing how did they get premises said ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him a bit dodgy it need loads of galleons to afford the rent on a place in diagon alley want to know what been up to to get their hands on that sort of gold 
 
 well yes that occurred to me too said hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop been wondering whether mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful 
 
 he said harry curtly 
 
 how do you know said ron and hermione together 
 
 because harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come there was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that fred and george were criminals because they got the gold from me i gave them my triwizard winnings last june 
 
 there was a shocked silence then teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor 
 
 oh harry you she said 
 
 yes i did said harry mutinously and i regret it either i need the gold and be great at running a joke shop 
 
 but this is excellent said ron looking thrilled all your fault harrymum blame me at all can i tell her 
 
 yeah i suppose better said harry dully specially if she thinks receiving stolen cauldrons or something 
 
 hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but harry had a shrewd suspicion that her was bound to crack before long sure enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak may sunshine she fixed harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air 
 
 harry interrupted her before she had even started 
 
 no good nagging me done he said firmly fred and george have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sounds of itand i get it back from them and i want to so save your breath hermione 
 
 i going to say anything about fred and george she said in an injured voice 
 
 ron snorted disbelievingly and hermione threw him a very dirty look 
 
 no i she said angrily as a matter of fact i was going to ask harry when going to go back to snape and ask for more occlumency lessons 
 
 heart sank once they had exhausted the subject of fred and dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hours ron and hermione had wanted to hear news of sirius as harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of what to tell them he had ended up saying truthfully that sirius wanted harry to resume occlumency lessons he had been regretting this ever since hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when harry least expected it 
 
 you tell me stopped having funny dreams hermione said now because ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night 
 
 harry threw ron a furious look ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself 
 
 you were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically something about just a bit further 
 
 i dreamed i was watching you lot play quidditch harry lied brutally i was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the quaffle 
 
 ears went red harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure he had not of course dreamed anything of the sort 
 
 last night he had once again made the journey along the department of mysteries corridor he had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres 
 
 he had hurried straight towards row number turned left and run along it it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud just a bit further for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his 
 
 you are trying to block your mind you said hermione looking beadily at harry you are keeping going with your occlumency 
 
 of course i am said harry trying to sound as though this question was insulting but not quite meeting her eye the truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue 
 
 the problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all and when he did his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams he also suspected that part of his mindthe part that often spoke in voicenow felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach the end 
 
 you know said ron whose ears were still flaming red if montague recover before slytherin play hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the cup 
 
 yeah i so said harry glad of a change of subject 
 
 i mean won one lost oneif slytherin lose to hufflepuff next saturday 
 
 yeah right said harry losing track of what he was agreeing to cho chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him 
 
 the final match of the quidditch season gryffindor versus ravenclaw was to take place on the last weekend of may although slytherin had been narrowly defeated by hufflepuff in their last match gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to abysmal record he however seemed to have found a new optimism 
 
 i mean i get any worse can i he told harry and hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match nothing to lose now is there 
 
 you know said hermione as she and harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd i think ron might do better without fred and george around they never exactly gave him a lot of confidence 
 
 luna lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head 
 
 oh gosh i forgot said hermione watching the eagle flapping its wings as luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing slytherins cho will be playing she 
 
 harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted 
 
 they found seats in the topmost row of the stands it was a fine ckar day ron could not wish for better and harry found himself hoping against hope that ron would not give the slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of weasley is our king 
 
 lee jordan who had been very dispirited since fred and george had left was commentating as usual as the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto 
 
 bradley davies chang he said and harry felt his stomach perform less of a back flip more a feeble lurch as cho walked out on to the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight was not sure what he wanted to happen any more except that he could not stand any more rows even the sight of her chatting animatedly to roger davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy 
 
 and off said lee and davies takes the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davies with the quaffle he dodges johnson he dodges bell he dodges spinnet as well going straight for goal going to shootandand lee swore very loudly and scored 
 
 harry and hermione groaned with the rest of the gryffindors predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 harry said a hoarse voice in ear hermione 
 
 harry looked round and saw enormous bearded face sticking between the seats apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them for some reason hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else 
 
 listen he whispered can yeh come with me now while watchin the match 
 
 er it wait hagrid asked harry till the match is over 
 
 no said hagrid no harry gotta be now while lookin the other way please 
 
 nose was gently dripping blood his eyes were both blackened harry had not seen him this since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone 
 
 course said harry at once course come 
 
 he and hermione edged back along their row of seats causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them the people in row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible 
 
 i ppreciate this you two i really do said hagrid as they reached the stairs he kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below i jus hope she doesn notice us goin 
 
 you mean umbridge said harry she got her whole inquisitorial squad sitting with her you see she must be expecting trouble at the match 
 
 yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted give us more time 
 
 what is it hagrid said hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the forest 
 
 see in a mo said hagrid looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them heydid someone jus score 
 
 be ravenclaw said harry heavily 
 
 good good said hagrid distractedly good 
 
 they had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step when they reached his cabin hermione turned automatically left towards the front door hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree when he realised they were no longer with him he turned 
 
 goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him 
 
 into the forest said hermione perplexed 
 
 yeah said hagrid now quick before spotted 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the trees behind hagrid who was already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm harry and hermione ran to catch up with him 
 
 hagrid why are you armed said harry 
 
 jus a precaution said hagrid shrugging his massive shoulders 
 
 you bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals said hermione timidly 
 
 nah well we weren goin in so far then said hagrid an anyway tha was before firenze left the forest wasn it 
 
 why does firenze leaving make a difference asked hermione curiously 
 
 cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me why said hagrid quietly glancing around they used ter bewell yeh couldn call em friendlybut we got on all righ kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if i wanted a word not any more 
 
 he sighed deeply 
 
 firenze said angry because he went to work for dumbledore harry said tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching profile 
 
 yeah said hagrid heavily well angry doesn cover it ruddy livid if i hadn stepped in i reckon kicked firenze ter death 
 
 they attacked him said hermione sounding shocked 
 
 yep said hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several branches he had half the herd on to him 
 
 and you stopped it said harry amazed and impressed by yourself 
 
 course i did stand by an watch em kill im could i said hagrid lucky i was passin really an thought firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid he added hotly and unexpectedly 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other startled but hagrid scowling did not elaborate 
 
 anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usud since then the other bin livid with me an the trouble is got a lot of influence in the forest cleverest creatures in here 
 
 is that why here hagrid asked hermione the centaurs 
 
 ah no said hagrid shaking his head dismissively no not them well o course they could complicate the problem yeah but see what i mean in a bit 
 
 on this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him 
 
 the path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the forest that it was as dark as dusk they were soon a long way past the clearing where hagrid had shown them the thestrals but harry felt no sense of unease until hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the forest 
 
 hagrid said harry fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which hagrid had stepped with ease and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the forest path where are we going 
 
 bit further said hagrid over his shoulder harry we need ter keep together now 
 
 it was a great struggle to keep up with hagrid what with branches and thickets of thorn through which hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs but which snagged harry and robes frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all harry could see of hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence the breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous 
 
 hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wands said hermione quietly 
 
 er all righ hagrid whispered back in fact 
 
 he stopped suddenly and turned around hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor 
 
 maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so i can fill yeh in said hagrid before we ge there like 
 
 good said hermione as harry set her back on her feet they both murmured lumos and their ignited face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad 
 
 righ said hagrid well see the thing is 
 
 he took a great breath 
 
 well a good chance goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then back at him 
 
 but lasted this long hermione said tentatively what makes you think 
 
 umbridge reckons it was me that put tha niffler in her office 
 
 and was it said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 no it ruddy well wasn said hagrid indignantly ter do with magical creatures an she thinks got somethin ter do with me yeh know bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since i got back i don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer well the special circumstances abou ter explain to yeh leave righ now before go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with trelawney 
 
 harry and hermione both made noises of protest but hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands 
 
 not the end o the world be able ter help dumbledore once outta here i can be useful ter the order an you have get through yer exams fine 
 
 his voice trembled and broke 
 
 don worry abou me he said hastily as hermione made to pat his arm he pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it look i wouldn be tellin yer this at all if i didn have ter see if i go well i can leave withou withou tellin someone because need yeh two ter help me an ron if willin 
 
 of course help you said harry at once what do you want us to do 
 
 hagrid gave a great sniff and patted harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force harry was knocked sideways into a tree 
 
 i knew say yes said hagrid into his handkerchief but i won never forget well jus a little bit further through here watch yerselves now nettles 
 
 they walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop 
 
 really easy he said softly very quiet now 
 
 they crept forwards and harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which harry hermione and hagrid now stood 
 
 sleepin breathed hagrid 
 
 sure enough harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work he glanced sideways at hermione who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open she looked utterly terrified 
 
 hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he 
 
 harry found this an odd question what is it was the one he had been planning on asking 
 
 hagrid you told us said hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told us none of them wanted to come 
 
 harry looked from her to hagrid and then as realisation hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror 
 
 the great mound of earth on which he hermione and hagrid could easily have stood was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing it was not a mound at all it was the curved back of what was clearly 
 
 wellnohe didn want ter come said hagrid sounding desperate but i had ter bring him hermione i had ter 
 
 but why asked hermione who sounded as though she wanted to cry whywhatoh hagrid 
 
 i knew if i jus got him back said hagrid sounding close to tears himself taught him a few be able ter take him outside an show harmless 
 
 harmless said hermione shrilly and hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep been hurting you all this time he why had all these injuries 
 
 he don know his own strength said hagrid earnestly an gettin better not fightin so much any more 
 
 so this is why it took you two months to get home said hermione distractedly oh hagrid why did you bring him back if he want to come he have been happier with his own people 
 
 they were all bullyin him hermione cause so small said hagrid 
 
 small said hermione small 
 
 hermione i couldn leave him said hagrid tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard my brother 
 
 hermione simply stared at him her mouth open 
 
 hagrid when you say brother said harry slowly do you mean 
 
 well amended hagrid turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had grawp here 
 
 grawp said harry 
 
 yeah well what it sounds like when he says his name said hagrid anxiously he don speak a lot of english bin tryin ter teach him anyway she don seem ter have liked him much she liked me see with giantesses what counts is producin good big kids and always been a bit on the runty side fer a sixteen foot 
 
 oh yes tiny said hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm absolutely minuscule 
 
 he was bein kicked aroun by all o themi jus couldn leave him 
 
 did madame maxime want to bring him back asked harry 
 
 shewell she could see it was right importan ter me said hagrid twisting his enormous hands she got a bit tired o him after a while i must admit so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though 
 
 how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing said harry 
 
 well why it took so long see said hagrid could travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff course he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter but he kep wantin ter go back 
 
 oh hagrid why on earth you let him said hermione flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands what do you think going to do with a violent giant who even want to be here 
 
 well now a bit harsh said hagrid still twisting his hands agitatedly admit he mighta taken a couple o swings at me when bin in a bad mood but gettin better loads better settlin down well 
 
 what are those ropes for then harry asked 
 
 he had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them 
 
 you have to keep him tied up said hermione faintly 
 
 well yeah said hagrid looking anxious like i sayhe doesn really know is own strength 
 
 harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest 
 
 so what is it you want harry and ron and me to do hermione asked apprehensively 
 
 look after him said hagrid croakily after gone 
 
 harry and hermione exchanged miserable looks harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised hagrid that he would do whatever he asked 
 
 whatwhat does that involve exactly hermione enquired 
 
 not food or anythin said hagrid eagerly he can get his own food no problem birds an deer an stuff no company he needs i xxjus knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit teachin him yeh know 
 
 harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them unlike hagrid who simply looked like an oversized human grawp looked strangely misshapen what harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as head it was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling hair the colour of bracken the rim of a single large fleshy ear was visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like uncle directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between the back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together was very broad and as grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins the legs were curled up under the body harry could see the soles of enormous filthy bare feet large as sledges resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor 
 
 you want us to teach him harry said in a hollow voice he now understood what warning had meant his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon course the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard fruitless attempts to teach grawp english 
 
 yeaheven if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said hagrid hopefully cause i reckon if he can talk ter people understand more that we all like im really an want im ter stay 
 
 harry looked at hermione who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face 
 
 kind of makes you wish we had norbert back it he said and she gave a very shaky laugh 
 
 do it then said hagrid who did not seem to have caugit what harry had just said 
 
 said harry already bound by his promise try hagrid 
 
 i knew i could count on yeh harry hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again an i don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like i know got exams if yeh could jus nip down here in yer invisibility cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with im wake im up thenintroduce yeh 
 
 whano said hermione jumping up hagrid no wake him really we need 
 
 but hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards grawp when he was about ten feet away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at harry and hermione then poked grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough 
 
 the giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away in front of harry and hermione meanwhile the gigantic grawp was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees he turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him 
 
 all righ grawpy said hagrid in a cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke grawp again had a nice sleep eh 
 
 harry and hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted they looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing it was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball the nose was stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of the eyes small by giant standards were a muddy and just now were together with sleep grawp raised dirty knuckles each as big as a cricket ball to his eyes rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility 
 
 oh my harry heard hermione squeal terrified beside him 
 
 the trees to which the other ends of the ropes around wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously he was as hagrid had said at least sixteen feet tall gazing blearily around grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself 
 
 anyway grawpy shouted hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs brought some friends ter meet yeh remember i told yeh i might remember when i said i might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit remember that grawpy 
 
 but grawp merely gave another low roar it was hard to say whether he was listening to hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds hagrid was making as speech he had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go 
 
 now grawpy don do that shouted hagrid how you ended up pullin up the others 
 
 and sure enough harry could see the earth around the roots beginning to crack 
 
 i got company for yeh hagrid shouted company see look down yeh big buffoon i brought yeh some friends 
 
 oh hagrid moaned hermione but hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave knee a sharp poke 
 
 the giant let go of the top of the tree which swayed alarmingly and deluged hagrid with a rain of pine needles and looked down 
 
 this said hagrid hastening over to where harry and herrmone stood is harry grawp harry potter he migh be comin ter visit yeh if i have ter go away understand 
 
 the giant had only just realised that harry and hermione were there they watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them 
 
 an this is hermione see her hagrid hesitated turning to hermione he said would yeh mind if he called yeh hermy hermione a difficult name fer him ter remember 
 
 no not at all squeaked hermione 
 
 this is hermy grawp an gonna be comin an all tha nice eh two friends fer yeh tergrawpy no 
 
 hand had shot out of nowhere towards hermione harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree so that fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air 
 
 bad boy grawpy they heard hagrid yelling as hermione clung to harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering very bad boy yeh don grabouch 
 
 harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go 
 
 righ said hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow well there yeh are met him an an now know yeh when yeh come back yeah well 
 
 he looked up at grawp who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground 
 
 well i reckon enough fer one day said hagrid go back now shall we 
 
 harry and hermione nodded hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the trees 
 
 nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last face was pale and set harry could not think of a single thing to say what on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that hagrid had hidden grawp in the forbidden forest and he had promised that he ron and hermione would continue totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant how could hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless fool himself that grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans 
 
 hold it said hagrid abruptly just as harry and hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him he pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow harry and hermione raised their wands now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by 
 
 oh blimey said hagrid quietly 
 
 i thought we told you hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here 
 
 a naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a chestnut body this centaur had a proud face and long black hair like hagrid he was armed a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders 
 
 how are yeh magorian said hagrid warily 
 
 the trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him harry recognised the and bearded bane whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met firenze bane gave no sign that he had ever seen harry before 
 
 so he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to magorian we agreed i think what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the forest again 
 
 this human now am i said hagrid testily jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder 
 
 you ought not to have meddled hagrid said magorian our ways are not yours nor are our laws firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us 
 
 i dunno how yeh work that out said hagrid impatiently done nothin except help albus dumbledore 
 
 firenze has entered into servitude to humans said a grey centaur with a hard deeply lined face 
 
 servitude said hagrid scathingly doin dumbledore a favour is all 
 
 he is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans said magorian quietly there can be no return from such disgrace 
 
 if yeh say so said hagrid shrugging but personally i think makin a big mistake 
 
 as are you human said bane coming back into our forest when we warned you 
 
 now yeh listen ter me said hagrid angrily have less of the our forest if all the same ter yeh not up ter yeh who comes an goes in here 
 
 no more is it up to you hagrid said magorian smoothly i shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young 
 
 not his interrupted bane contemptuously students magorian from up at the school they have probably already profited from the traitor teachings 
 
 nevertheless said magorian calmly the slaughter of foals is a terrible crimewe do not touch the innocent today hagrid you pass henceforth stay away from this place you forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor firenze escape us 
 
 i won be kept outta the fores by a bunch o old mules like yeh said hagrid loudly 
 
 hagrid said hermione in a and terrified voice as both bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground go please go 
 
 hagrid moved forwards but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon magorian 
 
 we know what you are keeping in the forest hagrid magorian called after them as the centaurs slipped out of sight and our tolerance is waning 
 
 hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to magorian 
 
 tolerate im as long as here as much his forest as yours he yelled as harry and hermione both pushed with all their might against moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him he seemed not to have felt it 
 
 calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they parted along behind him ruddy old mules though eh 
 
 hagrid said hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there if the centaurs want humans in the forest it really look as though harry and i will be able 
 
 ah you heard what they said said hagrid dismissively they hurt foalsi mean kids anyway we can let ourselves be pushed aroun by that lot 
 
 nice try harry murmured to hermione who looked crestfallen 
 
 at last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes the trees began to thin they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and in the distance the definite sounds of cheering and shouting 
 
 was that another goal asked hagrid pausing in the shelter of the trees as the quidditch stadium came into view or reckon the match is over 
 
 i know said hermione miserably harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair was full of twigs and leaves her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms he knew he must look little better 
 
 i reckon over yeh know said hagrid still squinting towards the stadium look people comin out alreadyif yeh two hurry be able ter blend in with the crowd an no know yeh there 
 
 good idea said harry well see you later then hagrid 
 
 i believe him said hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of hagrid i believe him i really believe him 
 
 calm down said harry 
 
 calm down she said feverishly a giant a giant in the forest and supposed to give him english lessons always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out him 
 
 we got to do anything yet harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice as they joined a stream of jabbering hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen 
 
 oh come off it harry said hermione angrily stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her of course going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what just seen who can blame umbridge 
 
 there was a pause in which harry glared at her and her eyes filled slowly with tears 
 
 you mean that said harry quietly 
 
 no well all right i she said wiping her eyes angrily but why does he have to make life so difficult for himselffor us 
 
 i dunno 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 and i wish stop singing that stupid song said hermione miserably they gloated enough 
 
 a great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch 
 
 oh get in before we have to meet the slytherins said hermione 
 
 weasley can save anything 
 
 he never leaves a single ring 
 
 why gryffindors all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 hermione said harry slowly 
 
 the song was growing louder but it was issuing not from a crowd of slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 no said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes said harry loudly 
 
 harry hermione yelled ron waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself we did it we won 
 
 they beamed up at him as he passed there was a scrum at the door of the castle and head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight harry and hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strains of weasley is our king died away then they turned to each other their smiles fading 
 
 save our news till tomorrow shall we said harry 
 
 yes all right said hermione wearily not in any hurry 
 
 they climbed the steps together at the front doors both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots
