 the surface of the question 
 of what is revolt composed 
 of nothing and of everything of an electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting forth of a wandering force of a passing breath this breath encounters heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away 
 whither 
 at random 
 athwart the state the laws athwart prosperity and the insolence of others 
 irritated convictions embittered enthusiasms agitated indignations instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love the whistle at the theatre the vague hatreds rancors disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it discomfort empty dreams ambitious that are hedged about whoever hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt 
 that which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants vagabonds of the those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who each day demand their bread from chance and not from toil the unknown of poverty and nothingness the the belong to revolt 
 whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state of life or of fate is ripe for riot and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind 
 revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as it eddies about mounts descends thunders tears razes crushes demolishes uproots bearing with it great natures and small the strong man and the feeble mind the tree trunk and the stalk of straw 
 woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes 
 it breaks the one against the other 
 it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power 
 it fills the with the force of events it converts everything into projectiles it makes a of a rough stone and a general of a porter 
 if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power 
 system revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow it puts the army to the test it consecrates the bourgeoisie it draws out the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force of the social framework 
 it is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene 
 power is in better health after a revolt as a man is after a good rubbing down 
 revolt thirty years ago was regarded from still other points of view 
 there is for everything a theory which proclaims itself good sense philintus against alcestis mediation offered between the false and the true explanation admonition rather haughty extenuation which because it is mingled with blame and excuse thinks itself wisdom and is often only pedantry 
 a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this 
 as between cold water and hot water it is the lukewarm water party 
 this school with its false depth all on the surface which dissects effects without going back to first causes chides from its height of a the agitation of the public square 
 if we listen to this school the riots which complicated the affair of deprived that great event of a portion of its purity 
 the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale abruptly followed by blue sky they made the cloudy sky reappear 
 they caused that revolution at first so remarkable for its unanimity to degenerate into a quarrel in the revolution of july as in all progress accomplished by fits and starts there had been secret fractures these riots rendered them perceptible 
 it might have been said 
 ah this is broken after the revolution of july one was sensible only of deliverance after the riots one was conscious of a catastrophe 
 all revolt closes the shops depresses the funds throws the exchange into consternation suspends commerce clogs business precipitates failures no more money private fortunes rendered uneasy public credit shaken industry disconcerted capital withdrawing work at a discount fear everywhere in every town hence gulfs 
 it has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs france twenty millions the second day forty the third sixty a three days uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions that is to say if only the financial result be taken into consideration it is equivalent to a disaster a shipwreck or a lost battle which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line 
 no doubt historically uprisings have their beauty the war of the pavements is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of thickets 
 in the one there is the soul of forests in the other the heart of cities the one has jean chouan the other has a jeanne revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character generosity devotion stormy gayety students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence the national guard invincible bivouacs of shopkeepers fortresses of street urchins contempt of death on the part of schools and legions clashed together 
 after all between the combatants there was only a difference of age the race is the same it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for their ideas at forty for their families 
 the army always a sad thing in civil wars opposed prudence to audacity 
 uprisings while proving popular intrepidity also educated the courage of the bourgeois 
 this is well 
 but is all this worth the bloodshed 
 and to the bloodshed add the future darkness progress compromised uneasiness among the best men honest liberals in despair foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand the vanquished of triumphing and saying we told you so 
 add paris enlarged possibly but france most assuredly diminished 
 add for all must needs be told the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad 
 to sum up all uprisings have been disastrous 
 thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie that approximation to the people so willingly contents itself 
 for our parts we reject this word uprisings as too large and consequently as too convenient 
 we make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement we do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle why a battle in the first place 
 here the question of war comes up is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity 
 and then are all uprisings calamities 
 and what if the revolt of july did cost a hundred and twenty millions 
 the establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards 
 even at the same price we should prefer the th of july 
 however we reject these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words 
 an uprising being given we examine it by itself 
 in all that is said by the doctrinarian objection above presented there is no question of anything but effect we seek the cause 
 we will be explicit

 book twelve 
 chapter vii 
 
 the dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our losses in killed and wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached voronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of her wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself to set off in search of prince andrew 
 when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster 
 a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the wife beckoned him to her 
 have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir 
 nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church 
 nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both her sorrow and her joy 
 there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel 
 the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face 
 and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure 
 princess mary interrupted him 
 oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully went out following her aunt 
 that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his life a thing he rarely did 
 princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her but that encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction 
 she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and he involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand her but simply loved her 
 reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening 
 how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure her prayer will be answered why i pray for what i want he suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sonya she was right he thought remembering what the wife had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides i love her not as i should o god release me from this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugar and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers 
 blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude 
 from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier has arrived and a letter for you 
 well all right thanks you can go 
 nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy 
 no not possible he cried aloud 
 unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence 
 this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate events the loss of almost the whole of the rostovs moscow property and the countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free 
 it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of everything no one can love you more than does 
 your sonya 
 both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess described their last days in moscow their departure the fire and the destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him 
 next day nicholas took his letter and went to see princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him might mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations 
 the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment

 the root of the matter 
 there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right 
 in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms 
 in all questions which result from collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt according as the tuileries contain a king or the convention they are justly or unjustly attacked the same cannon pointed against the populace is wrong on the th of august and right on the th of vendemiaire 
 alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true 
 that which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street it is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization the instinct of the masses may be troubled the same fury legitimate when directed against terray and absurd when directed against turgot 
 the destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of rails the demolition of docks the false routes of multitudes the refusal by the people of justice to progress ramus assassinated by students rousseau driven out of switzerland and is revolt 
 israel against moses athens against phocian rome against is an uprising paris against the is insurrection 
 the soldiers against alexander the sailors against christopher columbus this is the same revolt impious revolt why 
 because alexander is doing for asia with the sword that which christopher columbus is doing for america with the compass alexander like columbus is finding a world 
 these gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light that all resistance in that case is culpable sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself 
 the masses are traitors to the people 
 is there for example anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt a legitimate chronic revolt which at the decisive moment on the day of salvation at the very hour of popular victory espouses the throne turns into chouannerie and from having been an insurrection against becomes an uprising for sombre masterpieces of ignorance 
 the contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets and with a end round his neck mounts the white cockade death to the salt duties brings forth long live the king the assassins of the of september the manslaughterers of avignon the assassins of coligny the assassins of madam lamballe the assassins of brune miquelets verdets cadenettes the companions of jehu the chevaliers of brassard behold an uprising 
 la vendee is a grand catholic uprising the sound of right in movement is recognizable it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited masses there are mad rages there are cracked bells all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze 
 the brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress 
 show me in what direction you are going 
 rise if you will but let it be that you may grow great there is no insurrection except in a forward direction 
 any other sort of rising is bad every violent step towards the rear is a revolt to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right these pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud danton against louis xiv 
 is insurrection hebert against danton is revolt 
 hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be as lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes 
 there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw 
 revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power polignac is a rioter camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers 
 insurrection is sometimes resurrection 
 the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space of four thousand years filled with violated right and the suffering of peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it is capable 
 under the caesars there was no insurrection but there was juvenal 
 the facit indignatio replaces the gracchi 
 under the caesars there is the exile to syene there is also the man of the annales 
 we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on on on the flaming reflection of the apocalypse 
 john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him he is a jew and it is hebrew but the man who writes the annales is of the latin race let us rather say he is a roman 
 as the neros reign in a black way they should be painted to match the work of the alone would be too pale there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites 
 despots count for something in the question of philosophers a word that is chained is a terrible word 
 the writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master from this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze the compression of history produces conciseness in the historian the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant 
 tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force 
 the ciceronian period which hardly sufficed for verres would be blunted on caligula 
 the less spread of sail in the phrase the more intensity in the blow tacitus thinks with all his might 
 the honesty of a great heart condensed in justice and truth overwhelms as with lightning 
 be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed upon caesar 
 the tiberii were reserved for him caesar and tacitus are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the stage regulates the entrances and the exits caesar is great tacitus is great god spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another 
 the guardian of justice in striking caesar might strike too hard and be unjust god does not will it 
 the great wars of africa and spain the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization introduced into gaul into britanny into this glory covers the rubicon there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian sparing caesar tacitus and according extenuating circumstances to genius 
 certainly despotism remains despotism even under the despot of genius 
 there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants in such reigns nothing veils the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal slap this ignominy which cannot reply in the face more usefully in the presence of all humanity 
 rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla 
 under claudius and under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant 
 the villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small consciences are dull souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla thus it is under commodus thus it is under heliogabalus while from the roman senate under caesar there comes nothing but the odor of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles 
 hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacituses and the juvenals it is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his appearance 
 but juvenal and tacitus like isaiah in biblical times like dante in the middle ages is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong 
 in the majority of cases riot proceeds from a material fact insurrection is always a moral phenomenon 
 riot is masaniello insurrection spartacus 
 insurrection borders on mind riot on the stomach gaster grows irritated but gaster assuredly is not always in the wrong 
 in questions of famine riot buzancais for example holds a true pathetic and just point of departure nevertheless it remains a riot 
 why 
 it is because right at bottom it was wrong in form 
 shy although in the right violent although strong it struck at random it walked like a blind elephant it left behind it the corpses of old men of women and of children it wished the blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why 
 the nourishment of the people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means 
 all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the th of august even that of july th begin with the same troubles before the right gets set free there is foam and tumult in the beginning the insurrection is a riot just as a river is a torrent 
 ordinarily it ends in that ocean 
 revolution sometimes however coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire as the rhine is in a swamp 
 all this is of the past the future is another thing universal suffrage has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms 
 the disappearance of wars of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers such is the inevitable progression 
 whatever may be will be peace 
 however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former and the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such shades 
 in his mind all is sedition rebellion pure and simple the revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion 
 then the bourgeois shouts 
 long live the people 
 this explanation given what does the movement of june signify so far as history is concerned 
 is it a revolt 
 is it an insurrection 
 it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and insurrection the foundation 
 this movement of had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it is like a relic of 
 excited imaginations say they are not to be calmed in a day 
 a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain 
 there are no alps without their jura nor pyrenees without the asturias 
 this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter on the recital 
 the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space 
 there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor 
 petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history 
 the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history 
 we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we shall be able to say 
 we have seen this we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine 
 in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days the th and the th of june but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure 
 the root of the matter 
 there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right 
 in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms

 revolution sometimes however coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire as the rhine is in a swamp 
 all this is of the past the future is another thing universal suffrage has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms 
 the disappearance of wars of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers such is the inevitable progression 
 whatever may be will be peace 
 however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former and the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such shades 
 in his mind all is sedition rebellion pure and simple the revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion 
 then the bourgeois shouts 
 long live the people 
 this explanation given what does the movement of june signify so far as history is concerned 
 is it a revolt 
 is it an insurrection 
 it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and insurrection the foundation 
 this movement of had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it is like a relic of 
 excited imaginations say they are not to be calmed in a day 
 a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain 
 there are no alps without their jura nor pyrenees without the asturias 
 this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter on the recital 
 the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space 
 there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor 
 petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history 
 the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history 
 we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we shall be able to say 
 we have seen this we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine 
 in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days the th and the th of june but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure

 chapter viii 
 
 letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sonya 
 but a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all that was going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching and making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with nicholas 
 i shall not be at peace till you promise me this 
 sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was habit her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her former acts of she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her and the whole meaning of her life and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or religion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answered the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever 
 the bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity but when she heard of prince presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for natasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered sonya 
 at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a whole day 
 three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery sonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through the door that door opened and natasha came out looking excited not noticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sonya and took her hand 
 natasha what are you about come here said the countess 
 natasha went up to the monk for his blessing and advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint 
 as soon as the prior withdrew natasha took her friend by the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room 
 sonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how unhappy sonya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he lives he cannot because because of and natasha burst into tears 
 yes i knew it thank god murmured sonya he will live 
 sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she thought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two friends went together to prince door natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at the door 
 prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was calm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing 
 o natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching her arm and stepping back from the door 
 what what is it asked natasha 
 that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lips 
 natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window not yet understanding what the latter was telling her 
 you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression you remember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw 
 yes yes cried natasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen lying down 
 you remember sonya went on i saw it then and told everybody you and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror 
 she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had then said that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed 
 yes yes it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction 
 but what does it mean she added meditatively 
 oh i know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching at her head 
 a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him but sonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred 
 they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the countess was writing to her son 
 sonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed sonya you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal 
 sonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand 
 yes mamma i will write said she 
 sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision now that she knew that the renewal of relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas

 book th of june 
 chapter iii 
 
 a burial an occasion to be born again 
 in the spring of although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe for commotion 
 as we have said the great city resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the shot is discharged 
 in june the spark was the death of general lamarque 
 lamarque was a man of renown and of action 
 he had had in succession under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the and the bravery of the tribune 
 he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was discernible in his speech 
 like foy his predecessor after upholding the command he upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the emperor well he was in company with comtes gerard and drouet one of marshals in petto the treaties of removed him as a personal offence 
 he hated wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to intervening events in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of the hundred days napoleon had died uttering the word army lamarque uttering the word country 
 his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and by the government as an occasion 
 this death was an affliction like everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt this is what took place 
 on the preceding evening and on the morning of the th of june the day appointed for burial the faubourg which the procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors they armed themselves as best they might 
 joiners carried off of their establishment to break down doors 
 one of them had made himself a dagger of a hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump 
 another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed for three days 
 a carpenter named lombier met a comrade who asked him 
 whither are you going eh well i have no weapons 
 what then 
 going to my to get my compasses 
 what for 
 i know said lombier 
 a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted some passing artisans 
 come here you 
 he treated them to ten sous worth of wine and said 
 have you work 
 no go to filspierre between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil and you will find work 
 at they found cartridges and arms certain leaders were going the rounds that is to say running from one house to another to collect their men at near the barriere du trone at near the the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air they were heard to say 
 have you your pistol 
 under my blouse and you 
 under my shirt 
 in the rue traversiere in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of the in front of groups whispered together among them was observed a certain mavot who never remained more than a week in one shop as the masters always discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day 
 mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the rue menilmontant pretot who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavot and to the question 
 what is your object he replied 
 insurrection 
 workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de bercy waited for a certain lemarin the revolutionary agent for the faubourg watchwords were exchanged almost publicly 
 on the th of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general funeral procession traversed paris with official military pomp somewhat augmented through precaution 
 two battalions with draped drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords at their sides escorted the coffin the hearse was drawn by young men 
 the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel branches 
 then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the sectionaries of the friends of the people the law school the medical school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of banner children waving green boughs and carpenters who were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous rout again a column 
 squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated before him 
 on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety 
 an armed throng was passing and a terrified throng looked on 
 the government on its side was taking observations 
 it observed with its hand on its sword 
 four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the place louis xv 
 in their saddles with their trumpets at their head filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guard echelonned from street to street at the a squadron of dragoons at the greve half of the th light infantry the other half being at the bastille the th dragoons at the celestins and the courtyard of the louvre full of artillery 
 the remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks without reckoning the regiments of the environs of paris 
 power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing multitude thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue 
 divers reports were in circulation in the cortege 
 legitimist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reichstadt whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire 
 one personage whose name has remained unknown announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people that which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection here and there also in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said 
 let us plunder 
 there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water 
 a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers 
 the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille it rained from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng many incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at the duc de who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head the gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the porte an officer of the th light infantry saying aloud 
 i am a republican the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique 
 long live the republic marked the passage of the funeral train 
 at the bastille long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the faubourg effected a junction with the procession and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng 
 one man was heard to say to another 
 do you see that fellow with a red beard the one who will give the word when we are to fire it appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quenisset affair entrusted with this same function 
 the hearse passed the bastille traversed the small bridge and reached the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz 
 there it halted the crowd surveyed at that moment with a view would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread out over the quai bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the porte a circle was traced around the hearse 
 the vast rout held their peace lafayette spoke and bade lamarque farewell 
 this was a touching and august instant all heads uncovered all hearts beat high 
 all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with a pike surmounted with a red lafayette turned aside his head exelmans quitted the procession 
 this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it from the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude two prodigious shouts went up 
 lamarque to the pantheon lafayette to the some young men amid the declamations of the throng harnessed themselves and began to drag lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and lafayette in a along the quai morland 
 in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a centenarian afterwards who had also been in the war of and who had fought at trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette 
 in the meantime the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion and came to bar the bridge on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the celestins and deployed along the quai morland the men who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted 
 the dragoons the dragoons advanced at a walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air of gloomy expectation 
 they halted two hundred paces from the little bridge 
 the carriage in which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it to pass and then closed behind it 
 at that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched 
 the women fled in terror what took place during that fatal minute 
 no one can say it is the dark moment when two clouds come together 
 some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon 
 the fact is that three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed they are beginning too soon and all at once a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon sweeping all before them 
 then all is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and pass the small arm of the seine now filled in the of the isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants stakes are torn up fired a barricade begun the young men who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run and the municipal guard the carabineers rush up the dragoons ply their swords the crowd disperses in all directions a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of paris men shout 
 to arms they run tumble down flee resist 
 wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire

 the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him 
 but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only no of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer 
 all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him 
 that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object and so on 
 these questions like questions put at trials generally left the essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he knew he was in these power that only by force had they brought him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it 
 put that down bad very bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face 
 on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart 
 pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror 
 he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and rather mysterious power 
 these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre

 the ebullitions of former days 
 nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot everything bursts forth everywhere at once 
 was it foreseen yes 
 was it prepared 
 no whence comes it 
 from the pavements whence falls it 
 from the clouds 
 here insurrection assumes the character of a plot there of an improvisation 
 the first comer seizes a current of the throng and leads it whither he wills a beginning full of terror in which is mingled a sort of formidable gayety 
 first come clamors the shops are closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people flee blows from beat against portes cocheres servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying going to be a row 
 a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different spots in paris at once 
 in the rue twenty young men bearded and with long hair entered a and emerged a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape and having at their head three men armed one with a sword one with a gun and the third with a pike 
 in the rue des nonaindieres a very bourgeois who had a prominent belly a sonorous voice a bald head a lofty brow a black beard and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat offered cartridges publicly to 
 in the rue men with bare arms carried about a black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription republic or death 
 in the rue des jeuneurs rue du cadran rue montorgueil rue mandar groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number one of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between 
 they pillaged a factory of on the boulevard and three armorers shops the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the rue the other in the rue du temple in a few minutes the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns nearly all swords and pistols 
 in order to provide more arms one man took the gun the other the bayonet 
 opposite the quai de la greve young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing one of them had a they rang entered and set about making cartridges 
 one of these women relates 
 i did not know what cartridges were it was my husband who told me 
 one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vielles haudriettes and seized yataghans and turkish arms 
 the body of a mason who had been killed by a lay in the rue de la perle 
 and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and shouted 
 to arms broke street lanterns unharnessed carriages unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees rummaged cellars rolled out hogsheads heaped up rough slabs furniture and planks and made barricades 
 they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this 
 they entered the dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords and guns of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guns and swords and said 
 send for them at the office 
 they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in the streets on their way to the townhall 
 they tore the epaulets from officers 
 in the rue du an officer of the national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise 
 in the quartier the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the rue to the cafe du progress or descended to the cafe des in the rue des mathurins there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone distributed arms 
 they plundered the in the rue transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades on a single point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue and the rue where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands 
 at a single point the insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on a detachment of the national guard and fled through the rue de la corderie 
 the detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag a package of cartridges and three hundred the national guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets 
 all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder in less than an hour barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the halles alone 
 in the centre was that famous house no which was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which flanked on the one hand by a barricade at and on the other by a barricade of the rue maubuee commanded three streets the rue des arcis the rue and the rue which it faced 
 the barricades at right angles fell back the one of the rue montorgueil on the the other of the rue on the rue without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at one in the rue menilmontant where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of the made with an ecossais which had been unharnessed and overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police 
 at the barricade of the rue des menetriers a man distributed money to the workmen 
 at the barricade of the rue grenetat a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver 
 here said he this is to pay expenses wine et caetera 
 a young man without a cravat went from barricade to barricade carrying another with a naked sword a blue police cap on his head placed sentinels in the interior beyond the barricades the and porters lodges were converted into otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest 
 the society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to direct the insurrection in the quartier a man killed in the rue du ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of paris 
 that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air the insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison in less than three hours like a train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied on the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the whole of the marais the popincourt arms manufactory la galiote the and all the streets near the halles on the left bank the barracks of the veterans the place maubert the powder magazine of the and all the barriers at five in the evening they were masters of the bastille of the lingerie of the their scouts had reached the place des victoires and menaced the bank the barracks and the a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters 
 the conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points and as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits and armorers shops hastily invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with 
 about six in the evening the passage du saumon became the field of battle 
 the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other 
 they fired from one gate to the other 
 an observer a dreamer the author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano found himself in the passage between the two fires all that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two which separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour 
 meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in haste the legions emerged from the mayoralities the regiments from their barracks 
 opposite the passage de a drummer received a blow from a dagger 
 another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword 
 another was killed in the rue in the three officers fell dead one after the other 
 many of the municipal guards on being wounded in the rue des lombards retreated 
 in front of the a detachment of national guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription 
 republican revolution no 
 was this a revolution in fact 
 the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable tortuous colossal citadel 
 there was the hearth there evidently was the question all the rest was nothing but skirmishes 
 the proof that all would be decided there lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet 
 in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the fearful uncertainty of the crisis 
 they recalled the popular ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the d of the line in july 
 two intrepid men tried in great wars the marshal lobau and general bugeaud were in command bugeaud under lobau enormous patrols composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion

 on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the field it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french 
 it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well 
 he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent this was prince house where pierre had often been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout 
 they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant 
 davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes he said in a low voice 
 who are you 
 pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him 
 i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre 
 the chill that had been running down back now seized his head as in a vise 
 you cannot know me general i have never seen you 
 he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom pierre had not noticed 
 davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began 
 no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow 
 your name asked davout 
 bezukhov 
 what proof have i that you are not lying 
 monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading voice 
 davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war and law that look established human relations between the two men at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers 
 at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment 
 how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout coldly 
 pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was 
 you are not what you say returned davout 
 in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements 
 but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout 
 davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre 
 when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the field 
 he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout 
 yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did not know 
 pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to death not the men on the commission that had first examined him not one of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of life him pierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it was no one 
 it was a system a concurrence of circumstances 
 a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life of everything annihilating him

 originality of paris 
 during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more than one insurrection 
 nothing is generally more singularly calm than the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters 
 paris very speedily accustoms herself to is only a paris has so many affairs on hand that she does not put herself out for so small a matter 
 these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles these immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity 
 ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he contents himself with the remark 
 there appears to be a squabble in the rue 
 or 
 in the faubourg 
 often he adds carelessly 
 or somewhere in that direction 
 later on when the and mournful hubbub of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says 
 getting hot 
 hullo getting hot 
 a moment later the riot approaches and gains in force he shuts up his shop precipitately hastily dons his uniform that is to say he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person 
 men fire in a square in a passage in a blind alley they take and the barricade blood flows the riddles the fronts of the houses the balls kill people in their beds corpses encumber the streets 
 a few streets away the shock of can be heard in the cafes 
 the theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war 
 go their way are going to a dinner somewhere in town 
 sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on 
 in a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass 
 at the time of the insurrection of in the rue a little infirm old man pushing a surmounted by a tricolored rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering his glasses of cocoa to the government now to anarchy 
 nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings in paris which cannot be found in any other capital to this end two things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety the city of voltaire and napoleon is necessary 
 on this occasion however in the resort to arms of june th the great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself it was afraid 
 closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the most distant and most disinterested quarters 
 the courageous took to arms the poltroons hid 
 the busy and heedless disappeared 
 many streets were empty at four in the morning 
 alarming details were hawked about fatal news was disseminated that they were masters of the there were six hundred of them in the cloister of alone entrenched and embattled in the church that the line was not to be depended on that armand carrel had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said get a regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them nevertheless 
 i am with you 
 i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the first coming from the bastille the second from the porte the third from the greve the fourth from the halles that perhaps also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was serious 
 people busied themselves over marshal hesitations 
 why did not he attack at once 
 it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed the old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom 
 evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation were searched suspicious persons were arrested 
 by nine more than eight hundred persons had been arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the conciergerie so was la force 
 at the conciergerie in particular the long vault which is called the rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly 
 all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy shower 
 elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled on top of each other 
 anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris 
 people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was to be heard but this 
 ah my god he has not come home 
 there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard 
 people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were said 
 it is cavalry or 
 those are the caissons galloping to the trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable alarm peal from 
 they waited for the first men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared shouting 
 go home 
 and people made haste to bolt their doors 
 they said 
 how will all this end from moment to moment in proportion as the darkness descended paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt

 from prince house the prisoners were led straight down the field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of soldiers who were not on duty germans italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos 
 the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wish that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them 
 the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a domestic serf about years old with grizzled hair and a plump body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome man with a broad beard and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a thin lad of eighteen in a loose coat 
 pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task 
 a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french 
 then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and bound them to the post 
 twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them 
 again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his 
 on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through his mind 
 sharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led away alone pierre did not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution with horror and no sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes 
 pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other 
 when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head then when they propped him against the bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement 
 probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit 
 they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible 
 pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post and no one drove him away 
 when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by 
 pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they all went away silently and with drooping heads 
 that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen 
 pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away

 some explanations with regard to the origin of poetry the influence of an academician on this poetry 
 at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb 
 the rout was shaken their ranks were broken all ran fled made their escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose 
 at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old in the of a shop 
 mother going to borrow your machine 
 and off he ran with the pistol 
 two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the rue amelot and the rue basse encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing la nuit on ne voit rien 
 le jour on voit tres bien 
 ecrit apocrypha 
 le bourgeois 
 pratiquez la vertu 
 tutu chapeau pointu 
 at night one sees nothing by day one sees very well the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl practice virtue tutu pointed hat 
 it was little gavroche on his way to the wars 
 on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger 
 who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion we know not 
 who does know 
 himself perhaps 
 however gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation and he mingled with them his own chirpings 
 an observing urchin and a rogue he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of paris 
 he combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops he was acquainted with thieves a tribe contiguous to his own he had it appears been for three months apprenticed to a printer he had one day executed a commission for m one of the forty 
 gavroche was a gamin of letters 
 moreover gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of providence 
 his brothers in the evening his father in the morning that is what his night had been like on quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically extracted from it the two brats had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding them to that good mother the street who had brought him up almost entirely 
 on leaving them he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell 
 i break a cane otherwise expressed i cut my stick or as they say at the court i file off 
 if you find papa and mamma young uns come back here this evening 
 scramble you up some supper and give you a shakedown 
 the two children picked up by some policeman and placed in the refuge or stolen by some mountebank or having simply strayed off in that immense chinese puzzle of a paris did not return 
 the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces 
 gavroche did not see them again ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night 
 more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said 
 where the devil are my two children 
 in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du he noticed that there was but one shop open in that street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a shop 
 this presented a providential occasion to eat another before entering the unknown gavroche halted fumbled in his fob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even a sou and began to shout 
 help 
 it is hard to miss the last cake 
 nevertheless gavroche pursued his way 
 two minutes later he was in the rue while traversing the rue du he felt called upon to make good the loss of the which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight 
 a little further on on catching sight of a group of persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed 
 how fat those moneyed men are 
 drunk 
 they just wallow in good dinners 
 ask em what they do with their money they know 
 they eat it what they do 
 as much as their bellies will hold

 chapter xii 
 
 after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church 
 toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless 
 from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his life on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life 
 around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and asking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides 
 well then mates that very prince who some voice at the other end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who 
 sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad especially dreadful because of its simplicity and the faces of the murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him 
 beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it aroused interest 
 having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closed the knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himself comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and well rounded in these deft movements in the arrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him 
 seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said 
 and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betray his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones 
 eh lad fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ fret friend suffer an hour live for an age how it is my dear fellow and here we live thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men as well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees with a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part of the shed 
 eh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed so come you rascal she remembers now now do 
 and the soldier pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him returned to his place and sat down in his hands he had something wrapped in a rag 
 here eat a bit sir said he resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand 
 pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat 
 well are they all right said the soldier with a smile you should do like this 
 he took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from the rag and handed it to pierre 
 the potatoes are grand he said once more eat some like that 
 pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better 
 oh all right said he but why did they shoot those poor fellows the last one was hardly twenty 
 tss tt said the little man ah what a sin what a sin he added quickly and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that you stayed in moscow 
 i think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally replied pierre 
 and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house 
 no i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and tried me as an incendiary 
 where law injustice put in the little man 
 and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato 
 i it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow 
 why are you a soldier then 
 yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of fever we told anything there were some twenty of us lying there we had no idea never guessed at all 
 and do you feel sad here pierre inquired 
 how can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname is karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one to help feeling sad moscow the mother of cities how can one see all this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet dies first what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly 
 what what did you say asked pierre 
 who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as god judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said before and immediately continued 
 well and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they still living he asked 
 and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the lips as he put these questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that he had no mother 
 a wife for counsel a for welcome but none as dear as own mother said he well and have you little ones he went on asking 
 again negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened to add 
 never mind young folks yet and please god may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony 
 but all the same now pierre could not help saying 
 ah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or a sack 
 he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to tell a long story 
 well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had a homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so happened 
 and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into copse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had been tried flogged and sent to serve as a soldier 
 well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for my sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my younger brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife behind we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a soldier i come home on leave and tell you how it was i look and see that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle the women at home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the youngest at home father he says all my children are the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if platon been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go called us all to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons michael he says come here and bow down to his feet and you young woman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before him do you understand he says how it is dear fellow fate looks for a head but we are always judging not well not right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and it bulges but when drawn it out empty how it is 
 and platon shifted his seat on the straw 
 after a short silence he rose 
 well i think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating 
 lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ have mercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground got up sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw the way lay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a loaf he muttered as he lay down pulling his coat over him 
 what prayer was that you were saying asked pierre 
 eh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i saying i was praying you pray 
 yes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavra 
 well of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one must pity the animals too eh the rascal now curled up and got warm you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dog that lay at his feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediately 
 sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but inside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep but lay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring of platon who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations

 gavroche on the march 
 the brandishing of a triggerless pistol grasped in hand in the open street is so much of a public function that gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every moment 
 amid the scraps of the marseillaise which he was singing he shouted 
 all goes well 
 i suffer a great deal in my left paw all broken up with rheumatism but satisfied citizens 
 all that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well sneeze them out subversive couplets 
 what are the police spies 
 dogs 
 and just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol 
 just from the boulevard my friends 
 getting hot there getting into a little boil simmering 
 time to skim the pot forward march men 
 let an impure blood inundate the furrows i give my days to my country i shall never see my concubine more nini finished yes nini 
 but never mind 
 long live joy fight crebleu 
 had enough of despotism 
 at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having fallen gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement and picked up the man then he assisted in raising the horse 
 after which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way 
 in the rue de thorigny all was peace and silence 
 this apathy peculiar to the marais presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar 
 four gossips were chatting in a doorway 
 scotland has trios of witches paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags and the thou shalt be king could be quite as mournfully hurled at bonaparte in the carrefour baudoyer as at macbeth on the heath of armuyr 
 the croak would be almost identical 
 the gossips of the rue de thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns 
 three of them were portresses and the fourth was a with her basket on her back 
 all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age which are decrepitude decay ruin and sadness 
 the was humble 
 in this society it is the who salutes and the portress who patronizes this is caused by the corner for refuse which is fat or lean according to the will of the portresses and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap 
 there may be kindness in the broom 
 this was a grateful creature and she smiled with what a smile on the three portresses 
 things of this nature were said 
 ah by the way is your cat still cross 
 good gracious cats are naturally the enemies of dogs you know the dogs who complain 
 and people also 
 but the fleas from a cat go after people 
 not the trouble dogs are dangerous 
 i remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers 
 that was at the time when there were at the tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the king of rome do you remember the king of rome 
 i liked the duc de bordeau better 
 i knew louis xviii 
 i prefer louis xviii 
 meat is awfully dear it mother patagon 
 ah mention it the shop is a horror a horrible afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays 
 here the interposed 
 ladies business is dull 
 the refuse heaps are miserable no one throws anything away any more 
 they eat everything 
 there are poorer people than you la vargouleme 
 ah true replied the with deference i have a profession 
 a pause succeeded and the yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man added 
 in the morning on my return home i pick over my basket i sort my things 
 this makes heaps in my room 
 i put the rags in a basket the cores and stalks in a bucket the linen in my cupboard the woollen stuff in my commode the old papers in the corner of the window the things that are good to eat in my bowl the bits of glass in my fireplace the old shoes behind my door and the bones under my bed 
 gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening 
 old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics 
 he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple howl 
 another rascal 
 that got in his paddle 
 a pistol 
 well like to know what sort of a brat this is 
 that sort of animal is never easy unless overturning the authorities 
 gavroche disdainfully contented himself by way of reprisal with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide 
 the cried 
 you malicious little wretch 
 the one who answered to the name of patagon clapped her hands together in horror 
 going to be evil doings certain 
 the next door has a little pointed beard i have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm i saw him pass and he had a gun on his arm 
 mame bacheux says that last week there was a revolution the pontoise and then there you see him that horrid scamp with his pistol it seems that the celestins are full of pistols 
 what do you suppose the government can do with who know how to do anything but contrive ways of upsetting the world when we had just begun to get a little quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened good lord to that poor queen whom i saw pass in the tumbril and all this is going to make tobacco dearer 
 infamous and i shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine the wretch 
 got the sniffles old lady said gavroche blow your promontory 
 and he passed on 
 when he was in the rue pavee the occurred to his mind and he indulged in this soliloquy 
 in the wrong to insult the revolutionists mother this pistol is in your interests so that you may have more good things to eat in your basket 
 all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the portress patagon who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying 
 nothing but a bastard 
 oh 
 come now said gavroche i care a brass farthing for that 
 shortly afterwards he passed the hotel lamoignon 
 there he uttered this appeal 
 forward march to the battle 
 and he was seized with a fit of melancholy 
 he gazed at his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it 
 going off said he but you go off 
 one dog may distract the attention from another dog a very gaunt poodle came along at the moment 
 gavroche felt compassion for him 
 chien dog trigger 
 my poor doggy said he you must have gone and swallowed a cask for all the hoops are visible 
 then he directed his course towards

 soldiers three officers and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks 
 when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian kindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed whole figure in a french overcoat girdled with a cord a cap and bast shoes was round his head was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and his large gentle brown eyes were also round 
 platon karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed as he often did were all sound and good there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance 
 his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of innocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness 
 his physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on getting up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he only had to shake himself to be ready without a delay for some work just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could do everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewed planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed himself conversation of which he was fond and songs he did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birds evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds were always mournful delicate and almost feminine and his face at such times was very serious 
 having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits 
 a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches he would say 
 he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom 
 he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in a character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with man not any particular man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog his comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt that in spite of affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously gave spiritual life its due he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in the same way toward karataev 
 to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed him and sent him on errands but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth 
 platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude 
 sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him to repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a moment before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their context every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him which was his life but his life as he regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actions flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately

 just indignation of a 
 the worthy who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the empire they were talking 
 the had naturally spoken to the veteran of the riot then of general lamarque and from lamarque they had passed to the emperor 
 thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the razor and the sword 
 how did the emperor ride sir said the barber 
 badly 
 he did not know how to he never fell 
 did he have fine horses 
 he must have had fine horses 
 on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast it was a racing mare perfectly white 
 her ears were very wide apart her saddle deep a fine head marked with a black star a very long neck strongly articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper 
 a little more than fifteen hands in height 
 a pretty horse remarked the 
 it was his beast 
 the felt that after this observation a short silence would be fitting so he conformed himself to it and then went on 
 the emperor was never wounded but once was he sir 
 the old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there 
 in the heel 
 at ratisbon 
 i never saw him so well dressed as on that day 
 he was as neat as a new sou 
 and you mr veteran you must have been often wounded 
 i said the soldier ah not to amount to anything 
 at marengo i received two on the back of my neck a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz another in the left hip at jena at friedland a thrust from a bayonet the moskowa seven or eight no matter where at lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers 
 ah and then at waterloo a ball from a biscaien in the thigh all 
 how fine that is exclaimed the in pindaric accents to die on the field of battle 
 on my word of honor rather than die in bed of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs cataplasms syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a in my belly 
 not over fastidious said the soldier 
 he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop the had suddenly been fractured 
 the turned pale 
 ah good god he exclaimed one of them 
 what 
 a 
 here it is said the soldier 
 and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor it was a pebble 
 the ran to the broken window and beheld gavroche fleeing at the full speed towards the marche as he passed the shop gavroche who had the two brats still in his mind had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had flung a stone through his panes 
 you see shrieked the who from white had turned blue that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it what has any one done to that gamin

 chapter xiv 
 
 when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of her efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but to do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared to set off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son 
 in a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopen trap and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne little nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids tikhon and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her 
 the usual route through moscow could not be thought of and the roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk ryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as post horses were not everywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazan where the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous 
 during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and princess servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and no difficulties daunted her thanks to her activity and energy which infected her fellow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end of the second week 
 the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life her love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her it filled her whole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longer struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in words she had become convinced of it at her last interview with nicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the rostovs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that prince relations with natasha might if he recovered be renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this 
 yet in spite of that his relation to her considerate delicate and loving not only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved and was happy in regard to it 
 but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off as they looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fall ill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength 
 as always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of the journey itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there not after many days but that very evening again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit 
 the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the rostovs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrew was when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him from the window 
 i have found out everything your excellency the rostovs are staying at the merchant house in the square not far from here right above the volga said the courier 
 princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was her brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her 
 how is the prince she asked 
 his excellency is staying in the same house with them 
 then he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice how is he 
 the servants say he is still the same 
 what still the same might mean princess mary did not ask but with an unnoticed glance at little nicholas who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking and swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were let down 
 the carriage door was opened on the left there was water a great river and on the right a porch there were people at the entrance servants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this was sonya princess mary ran up the steps this way this way said the girl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced princess mary and kissed her 
 mon enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps 
 my child i love you and have known you a long time despite her excitement princess mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardly knowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her and asked how is he 
 the doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words 
 where is he can i see him can i asked the princess 
 one moment princess one moment my dear is this his son said the countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles there will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what a lovely boy 
 the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sonya was talking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy and the old count came in and welcomed the princess he had changed very much since princess mary had last seen him then he had been a brisk cheerful old man now he seemed a pitiful bewildered person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the destruction of moscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life 
 in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things which she had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people 
 this is my niece said the count introducing sonya you know her princess 
 princess mary turned to sonya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart 
 where is he she asked again addressing them all 
 he is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing we have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess 
 tears of vexation showed themselves in princess eyes she turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him when light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in almost running that natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long since 
 but hardly had the princess looked at face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friend she ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulder 
 as soon as natasha sitting at the head of prince bed heard of princess arrival she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary 
 there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room that of love boundless love for him for her and for all that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for others and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it was plain that at that moment there was in heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew 
 princess mary with her acute sensibility understood all this at the first glance at face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure 
 come come to him mary said natasha leading her into the other room 
 princess mary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to natasha she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything 
 how she began her question but stopped short 
 she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words face eyes would eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly 
 natasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw and suddenly lips twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs 
 princess mary understood 
 but she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust 
 but how is his wound what is his general condition 
 you you will see was all natasha could say 
 they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces 
 how has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse when did this happen princess mary inquired 
 natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had also passed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester natasha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course then fever set in but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious 
 but two days ago this suddenly happened said natasha struggling with her sobs i know why but you will see what he is like 
 is he weaker thinner asked the princess 
 no not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good he cannot cannot live because

 in the meantime in the marche where the post had already been disarmed gavroche had just effected a junction with a band led by enjolras courfeyrac combeferre and feuilly they were armed after a fashion 
 bahorel and jean prouvaire had found them and swelled the group 
 enjolras had a combeferre the gun of a national guard bearing the number of his legion and in his belt two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen jean prouvaire an old cavalry musket bahorel a rifle courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed feuilly with a naked sword in his hand marched at their head shouting long live poland 
 they reached the quai morland 
 cravatless hatless breathless soaked by the rain with lightning in their eyes 
 gavroche accosted them calmly 
 where are we going 
 come along said courfeyrac 
 behind feuilly marched or rather bounded bahorel who was like a fish in water in a riot 
 he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulged in the sort of words which break everything his waistcoat astounded a who cried in bewilderment 
 here are the reds 
 the reds the reds retorted bahorel 
 a queer kind of fear bourgeois 
 for my part i tremble before a poppy the little red hat inspires me with no alarm 
 take my advice bourgeois leave fear of the red to horned cattle 
 he caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world a permission to eat eggs a lenten admonition addressed by the archbishop of paris to his flock 
 bahorel exclaimed 
 flock a polite way of saying geese 
 and he tore the charge from the nail 
 this conquered gavroche from that instant gavroche set himself to study bahorel 
 bahorel observed enjolras you are wrong 
 you should have let that charge alone he is not the person with whom we have to deal you are wasting your wrath to no purpose 
 take care of your supply one does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun 
 each one in his own fashion enjolras retorted bahorel this prose shocks me i want to eat eggs without being permitted 
 your style is the hot and cold i am amusing myself 
 besides not wasting myself getting a start and if i tore down that charge hercle twas only to whet my appetite 
 this word hercle struck gavroche 
 he sought all occasions for learning and that of posters possessed his esteem he inquired of him 
 what does hercle mean 
 bahorel answered 
 it means cursed name of a dog in latin 
 here bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the a b c he shouted to him 
 quick cartridges para bellum 
 a fine man true said gavroche who now understood latin 
 a tumultuous retinue accompanied artists young men affiliated to the cougourde of aix artisans longshoremen armed with clubs and bayonets some like combeferre with pistols thrust into their trousers 
 an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band 
 he had no arms and he made great haste so that he might not be left behind although he had a thoughtful air 
 gavroche caught sight of him 
 keksekca said he to courfeyrac 
 an old duffer 
 it was m mabeuf

 chapter xv 
 
 when natasha opened prince door with a familiar movement and let princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt the sobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and now tried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears 
 the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words two days ago this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death as she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle mild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which therefore affected her very strongly she was sure he would speak soft tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence yet sooner or later it had to be and she went in the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features and then she saw his face and met his gaze 
 he was lying in a dressing gown on a divan surrounded by pillows he was thin and pale in one thin translucently white hand he held a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them as they entered 
 on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess pace suddenly slackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes 
 but in what am i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern look replied because you are alive and thinking of the living while i 
 in the deep the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and natasha 
 he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wont 
 how are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look 
 had he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horror into princess heart as the tone of his voice 
 and have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember 
 how are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she was saying 
 that my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again making an evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts 
 merci chere amie venue 
 thank you for coming my dear 
 princess mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince just perceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she now understood what had happened to him two days before in his words his tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else something the living did not and could not understand and which wholly occupied his mind 
 there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he breaking the silence and pointing to natasha she looks after me all the time 
 princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say that before her whom he loved and who loved him had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone if he had not known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence the only explanation was that he was indifferent because something else much more important had been revealed to him 
 the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off 
 mary came by way of ryazan said natasha 
 prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary and only after calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herself 
 really he asked 
 they told her that all moscow has been burned down and that 
 natasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was making an effort to listen but could not do so 
 yes they say burned he said a great pity and he gazed straight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingers 
 and so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he wrote here that he took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people if you liked him too it would be a good thing for you to get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking 
 princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living 
 why talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natasha 
 natasha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were again silent 
 andrew would you like princess mary suddenly said in a trembling voice would you like to see little nicholas he is always talking about you 
 prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but princess mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him 
 yes i shall be very glad to see him is he quite well 
 when little nicholas was brought into prince room he looked at his father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one else was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him 
 when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to her brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry 
 he looked at her attentively 
 is it about nicholas he asked 
 princess mary nodded her head weeping 
 mary you know the gosp but he broke off 
 what did you say 
 nothing you cry here he said looking at her with the same cold expression 
 when princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view 
 yes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it is 
 the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary but no they will take it their own way they understand they understand that all those feelings they prize so all our feelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he remained silent 
 prince little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father mary and natasha than he had then he understood it completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up to natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry 
 after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly and shyly 
 when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what face had told her she did not speak any more to natasha of hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now so evident

 chapter v 
 
 the old man 
 let us recount what had taken place 
 enjolras and his friends had been on the boulevard bourdon near the public storehouses at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge 
 enjolras courfeyrac and combeferre were among those who had taken to the rue bassompierre shouting 
 to the barricades in the rue lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along what had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a as though he were intoxicated 
 moreover he had his hat in his hand although it had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the very time 
 courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf 
 he knew him through having many times accompanied marius as far as his door 
 as he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charges almost in the midst of a fusillade hatless in the rain and strolling about among the bullets he had accosted him and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian 
 m mabeuf go to your home 
 why 
 going to be a row 
 well 
 thrusts with the sword and firing m mabeuf 
 that is well 
 firing from cannon 
 that is good 
 where are the rest of you going 
 we are going to fling the government to the earth 
 that is good 
 and he had set out to follow them 
 from that moment forth he had not uttered a word 
 his step had suddenly become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head 
 he advanced nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping 
 what a fierce old fellow muttered the students 
 the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old regicide 
 the mob had turned in through the rue de la verrerie 
 little gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of him a sort of trumpet 
 he sang 
 voici la lune qui paratt 
 quand dans la foret 
 demandait charlot a charlotte 
 tou tou tou 
 pour chatou 
 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 pour avoir bu de grand matin 
 la rosee a meme le thym 
 deux moineaux etaient en ribotte

 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 et ces deux pauvres petits loups

 they directed their course towards 
 here is the morn appearing 
 when shall we go to the forest charlot asked charlotte 
 tou tou tou for chatou i have but one god one king one and one boot 
 and these two poor little wolves were as tipsy as sparrows from having drunk dew and thyme very early in the morning 
 and these two poor little things were as drunk as thrushes in a vineyard a tiger laughed at them in his cave the one cursed the other swore 
 when shall we go to the forest charlot asked charlotte

 book twelve 
 chapter xvi 
 
 not only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and by the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable 
 formerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear 
 he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky and knew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it 
 during the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that principle of love the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love stands between life and death when during those first days he remembered that he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the better 
 but after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to his lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin he could not now regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive and he dared not inquire 
 his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natasha referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for natasha and a last though ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown 
 it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and his thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by the table he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him 
 ah she has come thought he 
 and so it was in place sat natasha who had just come in noiselessly 
 since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees she started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball and regained her former position 
 he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously 
 at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the future 
 can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groaned from a habit acquired during his sufferings 
 on hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking leaned nearer to him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him and bent over him 
 you are not asleep 
 no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light i want to weep for joy 
 natasha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy 
 natasha i love you too much more than anything in the world 
 and i she turned away for an instant why too much she asked 
 why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your whole soul shall i live what do you think 
 i am sure of it sure natasha almost shouted taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement 
 he remained silent awhile 
 how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it 
 natasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet 
 but you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleep please 
 he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked at him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished 
 soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration 
 as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind about life and death and chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it 
 love what is love he thought 
 love hinders death love is life all everything that i understand i understand only because i love everything is everything exists only because i love everything is united by it alone love is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall return to the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they were too personal and and there was the former agitation and obscurity he fell asleep 
 he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares but he continued to speak surprising them by empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began to disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything depended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in something not human death was breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized the door making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from behind by that terror opened and closed again 
 once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was death and prince andrew died 
 but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleep and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke 
 yes it was death i died and woke up yes death is an awakening and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and that strange lightness did not again leave him 
 when waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natasha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at her strangely not understanding 
 that was what had happened to him two days before princess arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest natasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing 
 from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream 
 there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening 
 his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess mary and natasha who did not leave him felt this they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had left them but on what reminded them most closely of him his body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in words what they understood 
 they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right 
 he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the and turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do 
 when the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leaving occurred princess mary and natasha were present 
 is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless growing cold before them natasha went up looked at the dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not kiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his body 
 where has he gone where is he now 
 when the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept 
 little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was no more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too must take the same terrible step 
 natasha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence

 of friendship 
 it had been hard for him that spake it to have put more truth and untruth together in few words than in that speech whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god for it is most true that a natural and secret hatred and aversion towards society in any man hath somewhat of the savage beast but it is most untrue that it should have any character at all of the divine nature except 
 it proceed not out of a pleasure in solitude but out of a love and desire to sequester a self or a higher conversation such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly in some of the heathen as epimenides the candian numa the roman empedocles the sicilian and apollonius of tyana and truly and really in divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of the church 
 but little do men perceive what solitude is and how far it extendeth for a crowd is not company and faces are but a gallery of pictures and talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love 
 
 the latin adage meeteth with it a little magna civitas magna solitude because in a great town friends are scattered so that there is not that fellowship for the most part which is in less neighbourhoods but we may go further and affirm most truly that it is a mean and miserable solitude to want true friends without which the world is but a wilderness and even in this sense also of solitude whosoever 
 in the frame of his nature and affections is unfit for friendship he taketh it of the beast and not from humanity 
 
 a principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the fullness and swellings of the heart which passions of all kinds do cause and induce we know diseases of stoppings and suffocations are the most dangerous in the body and it is not much otherwise in the mind you may take sarza to open the liver steel to open the spleen 
 flower of sulphur for the lungs castoreum for the brain but no receipt openeth the heart but a true friend to whom you may impart griefs joys fears hopes suspicions counsels and whatsoever lieth upon the heart to oppress it in a kind of civil shrift or confession 
 
 it is a strange thing to observe how high a rate great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of friendship whereof we spoke so great as they purchase it many times at the hazard of their own safety and greatness for princes in regard of the distance of their fortune from that of their subjects and servants cannot gather 
 this fruit except to make themselves capable thereof they raise some persons to be as it were companions and almost equals to themselves which many times sorteth to inconvenience 
 the modem languages give unto such persons the name of favourites or privadoes as if it were matter of grace or conversation 
 but the roman name attaineth the true use and cause thereof naming them participes durarum for it is that which tieth the knot and we see plainly that this hath been done not by weak and passionate princes only but by the wisest and most politic that ever reigned 
 who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants whom both themselves have called friends and allowed others likewise to call them in the same manner using the word which is received between private men 
 
 l sulla when he commanded rome raised pompey after surnamed the great to that height that pompey vaunted himself for overmatch for when he had carried the consulship for a friend of his against the pursuit of sulla and that sulla did a little resent thereat and began to speak great pompey turned upon him again and in effect bade him be quiet for that more men adored the sun rising than the sun setting with julius caesar decimus brutus had obtained that interest as he set him down in his testament for heir in remainder after his nephew 
 and this was the man that had power with him to draw him forth to his death for when caesar would have discharged the senate in regard of some ill presages and especially a dream of calpurnia this man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair telling him 
 
 he hoped he would not dismiss the senate till his wife had dreamt a better dream 
 
 and it seemeth his favour was so great as antonius in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of philippics callelh him veneftca witch as if he had enchanted caesar augustus raised 
 agrippa though of mean birth to that height as when he consulted with maecenas about the marriage of his daughter julia maecenas 
 took the liberty to tell him that he must either marry his daughter to agrippa or take away his life there was no third way he had made him so great with tiberius caesar seianus had ascended to that height as they two were termed and reckoned as a pair of friends 
 tiberius in a letter to him saith haecpro amicitia nostra non 
 occultavi and the whole senate dedicated an altar to friendship as to a goddess in respect of the great deamess of friendship between them two the like or more was between septimius severus and plautianus for he forced his eldest son to many the daughter of plaudainus and would often maintain plautianus in doing affronts to 
 his son and did write also in a letter to the senate by these words i love the man so well as i wish he may me now if these princes had been as a trajan or a marcus aurelius a man might have thought that this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of nature but being men so wise of such strength and severity of mind 
 and so extreme lovers of themselves as all these were it proveth most plainly that they found their own felicity though as great as ever happened to mortal men but as an half piece except they mought have a friend to make it entire and yet which is more they were princes that had wives sons nephews and yet all these could 
 not supply the comfort of friendship 
 
 it is not to be forgotten what commineus observeth of his first master duke charles the hardy namely mat he would communicate his secrets with none and least of all those secrets which troubled him most whereupon he goeth on and saith that towards his latter time that closeness did impair and a little perish his understanding 
 
 surely commineus mought have made the same judgement also if it had pleased him of his second master lewis the eleventh whose closeness was indeed his tormentor 
 
 the parable of pythagoras is dark but true cor ne edito eat not the heart certainly if a man would give it a hard phrase those that want friends to open themselves unto are cannibals of their own hearts but one thing is most admirable wherewith i will conclude this first fruit of friendship which is that this communicating of a 
 self to his friend works two contrary effects for it redoubleth joys and cutteth griefs in halves for there is no man that imparteth his joys to his friend but he joyeth the more and no man that imparteth his griefs to his friend but he grieveth the less so that it is in truth of operation upon a mind of like virtue as the alchemists use to attribute to their stone for body that it worketh all contrary effects but still to the good and benefit of nature but yet without 
 praying in aid of alchemists there is a manifest image of this in the ordinary course of nature for in bodies union strengtheneth and cherisheth any natural action and on the other side weakeneth and dulleth any violent impression and even so is it of minds 
 
 the second fruit of friendship is healthful and sovereign for the understanding as the first is for the affections for frendship maketh indeed a fair day in the affections from storm and tempests but it maketh daylight in the understanding out of darkness and confusion of thoughts neither is this to be understood only of faithful counsel which a man receiveth from his friend but before you come to that 
 certain it is that whosoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts his wits and understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with another he tosseth his thoughts more easily he marshalled them more orderly he seeth how they look when they are turned into words finally he waxeth wiser than 
 himself and that more by an discourse then by a meditation it was well said by themistocles to the king of persia 
 that speech was like cloth of arras opened and put abroad whereby the imagery doth appear in figure whereas in thoughts they lie but as in packs neither is this second fruit of friendship in opening the understanding restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man counsel they indeed are best but even without that 
 a man learneth of himself and bringeth his own thoughts to light and whetteth his wits as against a stone which itself cuts not in a word a man were better relate himself to a statue or picture then to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother 
 
 add now to make this second fruit of friendship complete that other point which lieth more open and falleth within vulgar observation which is faithful counsel from a friend heraclitus saith well in one of his enigmas dry light is ever the best and certain it is that the light that a man receiveth by counsel from another is drier and purer than that which cometh from his own understanding and judgement 
 which is ever infused and drenched in his affections and customs so as there is as much difference between the counsel that a friend giveth and that a man giveth himself as there is between the counsel of a friend and of a flatterer 
 for there is no such flatterer as is a self and there is no such remedy against flattery of a self as the liberty of a friend counsel is of two sorts the one concerning manners the other concerning business for the first the best preservative to keep 
 the mind in health is the faithful admonition of a friend the calling of a self to a strict account is a medicine sometime too piercing and corrosive reading good books of morality is a lime flat and dead observing our faults in others is sometimes improper for our case but the best receipt best i say to work and best 
 to take is the admonition of a friend it is a strange thing to behold what gross errors and extreme absurdities many especially of the greater sort do commit for want of a friend to tell them of them to the great damage both of their fame and fortune for as st james saith they are as men that look sometimes into a glass and presently forget their own shape and favour as for business a man may think 
 if he will that two eyes see no more than one or that a gamester seeth always more than a looker on or that a man in anger is as wise as he that hath said over the four and twenty letters or that a musket may be shot off as well upon the arm as upon a rest and such other fond and high imaginations to think himself all in all 
 
 but when all is done the help of good counsel is that which setteth business straight 
 and if any man think that he will take counsel but it shall be by pieces asking counsel in one business of one man and in another business of another man it is well that is to say better perhaps than if he asked none at all but he runneth two dangers one that he shall not be faithfully counselled for it is a rare thing except it be from a perfect and entire friend to have counsel given but such as 
 shall be bowed and crooked to some ends which he hath that giveth it the other that he shall have counsel given hurtful and unsafe though with good meaning and mixed partly of mischief and partly of remedy even as if you would call a physician that is thought good for the cure of the disease you complain of but is unacquainted with your body and therefore may put you in way for a present cure but overthroweth your health in some other kind 
 and so cure the disease and kill the patient but a friend that is wholly acquainted with a estate will beware by furthering any present business how he dasheth upon other inconvenience 
 and therefore rest not upon scattered counsel they will rather distract and mislead than seme and direct after these two noble fruits of frendship peace in the affections and support of the judgement followeth the last fruit which is like the pomegranate full of many kernels i mean aid and bearing a part in all actions and occasions here the best way to represent to life the manifold use of frendship is to cast and see how many things there are which a man 
 cannot do himself and then it will appear that it was a sparing speech of the ancients to say that a friend is another himself for that a friend is far more than himself 
 men have their time and die many times in desire of some things which they principally take to heart the bestowing of a child the finishing of a work or the like if a man have a true friend he may rest almost secure that the care of those things will continue after him so that a man hath as it were two lives in his desires 
 
 a man hath a body and that body is confined to a place but where friendship is all offices of life are as it were granted to him and his deputy for he may exercise them by his friend how many things are there which a man cannot with any face or comeliness say or do himself a man can scarce allege his own merits with modesty 
 much less extol them a man cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg and a number of the like but all these things are graceful in a mouth which are blushing in a own so again a person hath many proper relations which he cannot 
 put off a man cannot speak to his son but as a father to his wife but as a husband to his enemy but upon terms whereas a friend may speak as the case requires and not as it sorteth with the person but to enumerate these things were endless i have given the rule where a man cannot fitly play his own part if he have not a friend he may quit the stage

 book fall 
 chapter xii 
 
 the bishop works 
 the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden 
 madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation 
 monseigneur monseigneur she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is 
 yes replied the bishop 
 jesus the lord be blessed she resumed i did not know what had become of it 
 the bishop had just picked up the basket in a he presented it to madame magloire 
 here it is 
 well said she 
 nothing in it 
 and the silver 
 ah returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you i know where it is 
 great good god 
 it is stolen 
 that man who was here last night has stolen it 
 in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned to the bishop 
 the bishop had just bent down and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des guillons which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed 
 he rose up at madame cry 
 monseigneur the man is gone 
 the silver has been stolen 
 as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible the coping of the wall had been torn away 
 stay yonder is the way he went 
 he jumped over into cochefilet lane 
 ah the abomination 
 he has stolen our silver 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire 
 and in the first place was that silver ours 
 madame magloire was speechless 
 another silence ensued then the bishop went on 
 madame magloire i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully it belonged to the poor 
 who was that man 
 a poor man evidently 
 alas 
 jesus returned madame magloire 
 it is not for my sake nor for it makes no difference to us 
 but it is for the sake of monseigneur 
 what is monseigneur to eat with now 
 the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement 
 ah come 
 are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons 
 madame magloire shrugged her shoulders 
 pewter has an odor 
 iron forks and spoons then 
 madame magloire made an expressive grimace 
 iron has a taste 
 very well said the bishop wooden ones then 
 a few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening 
 as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really does not need either fork or spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk 
 a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that and to lodge him close to self 
 and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal ah mon dieu it makes one shudder to think of it 
 as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door 
 come in said the bishop 
 the door opened 
 a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold 
 three men were holding a fourth man by the collar the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean 
 a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was standing near the door 
 he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute 
 monseigneur said he 
 at this word jean valjean who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stupefaction 
 monseigneur he murmured 
 so he is not the cure 
 silence said the gendarme 
 he is monseigneur the bishop 
 in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted 
 ah here you are he exclaimed looking at jean valjean i am glad to see you 
 well but how is this 
 i gave you the candlesticks too which are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons 
 jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of 
 monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then 
 we came across him 
 he was walking like a man who is running away 
 we stopped him to look into the matter he had this silver 
 and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night 
 i see how the matter stands 
 and you have brought him back here 
 it is a mistake 
 in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go 
 certainly replied the bishop 
 the gendarmes released jean valjean who recoiled 
 is it true that i am to be released he said in an almost inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep 
 yes thou art released dost thou not understand said one of the gendarmes 
 my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your candlesticks 
 take them 
 he stepped to the took the two silver candlesticks and brought them to jean valjean 
 the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture without a look which could disconcert the bishop 
 jean valjean was trembling in every limb 
 he took the two candlesticks mechanically and with a bewildered air 
 now said the bishop go in peace 
 by the way when you return my friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden you can always enter and depart through the street door 
 it is never fastened with anything but a latch either by day or by night 
 then turning to the gendarmes 
 you may retire gentlemen 
 the gendarmes retired 
 jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting 
 the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice 
 do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man 
 jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless 
 the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them 
 he resumed with solemnity 
 jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good it is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god

 the empire strikes back 
 xiii 
 
 six imperial stormtroopers guarded lando leia and chewbacca as they marchedthrough the inner corridor of cloud city they reached an intersection when twelveof guards and his aide arrived to block their path 
 code force seven lando commanded as he stopped in front of his aide 
 at that moment the twelve guards aimed their laser weapons at the startledstormtroopers and aide calmly took the six troopers weapons from handed one of the guns to leia and one to lando then waited for the next order 
 hold them in the security tower the cloud city administrator said one must know 
 the guards and aide carrying the extra weapons marched thestormtroopers away to the tower 
 leia had watched this rapid turn of events in confusion but her confusionturned to astonishment when lando the man who had betrayed han solo beganremoving bonds 
 come on he urged getting out of here 
 the giant hands were freed at last not caring to wait forexplanations chewbacca turned toward the man who had freed him and with roar lunged at lando and began to throttle him 
 after what you did to han leia said i trust you to 
 lando desperately trying to free himself from ferocious grip triedto explain i had no choice he the wookiee interrupted him with anangry bark 
 still a chance to save han lando gasped at the eastplatform 
 chewie leia said at last go 
 still fuming chewbacca released lando and glared at him as calrissian foughtto regain his breath 
 keep your eyes on him chewie leia cautioned as the wookiee growledthreateningly 
 i have a feeling lando muttered under his breath that making anotherbig mistake 
 the stout little r unit meandered up and down the corridor sending hisscanners in every possible direction as he tried to detect some sign of his any kind of life he realized he was dreadfully turned around and had lost trackof how many meters he had traveled 
 as turned a corner he spotted a number of forms moving up thecorridor beeping and whistling droid greetings he hoped that these were friendlysorts 
 his tooting was detected by one of the creatures who began to call out to him 
 artooartoo it was threepio 
 chewbacca still carrying the semiassembled quickly turnedaround to see the stubby r droid rolling their way but as the wookiee was spun out of sight of his friend 
 wait the aggravated threepio demanded turn around you trying to save han from the bounty hunter 
 artoo scooted forward beeping all the way and threepio patiently replied to hisfrantic questions 
 i know but master luke can take care of himself at least that was kept telling himself as the group continued its search for han 
 on the east landing platform of cloud city two guards shoved the frozen bodyof han solo through a side hatchway of the slave boba fett climbed up a laddernext to the opening and boarded his ship ordering it sealed as soon as he entered thecockpit 
 fett ignited his engines and the craft began rolling across the platform fortakeoff 
 lando leia and chewbacca raced onto the platform in time only to see theslave lifting off and soaring into the orange and purple of the cloud city his blaster chewbacca howled and fired the weapon at the departingspaceship 
 no use lando told him out of range 
 all but threepio gazed at the departing craft still strapped to he saw something that the others had not yet noticed 
 oh my no he exclaimed 
 charging the group was a squad of imperial stormtroopers blasts already issuingfrom their drawn blasters the first bolt narrowly missed princess leia landoresponded quickly in returning the enemy fire and the air was ablaze with a of red and green bolts 
 artoo scooted over to the elevator and hid inside peeking out to seethe fury of the battle from a safe distance 
 lando shouted above the sounds of the blasters come on move hecalled breaking for the open elevator and blasting at the stormtroopers as he ran 
 but leia and chewbacca did not move they stood their ground and kept up asteady fire against the assault of the stormtroopers troopers groaned and droppedas their chests arms and stomachs erupted under the fatally accurate aim of this onefemale human and one male wookiee 
 lando sticking his head out of the elevator tried to get their attention motioningthem to run but the two seemed possessed as they blasted away getting retaliationfor all of their anger and captivity and the loss of one they both loved they weredetermined to extinguish the lives of these minions of the galactic empire 
 threepio would gladly have been anywhere else unable to get away all hecould do was frantically yell for help artoo help me he screamed how did iget into this what a fate worse than death it is to be strapped to the back of awookiee 
 get in here lando shouted again hurry up hurry up 
 leia and chewbacca began to move toward him evading the erupting rain oflaser fire as they rushed inside the waiting elevator as the elevator door glimpsed the remaining troopers racing at them 
 lightsaber clashed in luke skywalker and darth battle on the platformabove the chamber 
 luke felt the shaking platform shudder with every blow and parry and thrust oftheir weapons but he was undaunted for with every thrust of his sword he drovethe evil darth vader back 
 vader using his lightsaber to ward off aggressive lunges spoke calmly asthey fought the fear does not reach you you have learned more than ianticipated 
 find full of surprises the confident youth retorted threateningvader with yet another thrust 
 and i too was the calm portentous reply 
 with two graceful moves the dark lord hooked weapon out of his handsand sent it flying away a slash of energy blade at feet made theyouth jump back in an effort to protect himself but he stumbled backward andtumbled down the stairs 
 sprawled on the platform luke gazed up and saw the ominous dark figurelooming above him at the top of the stairs then the figure flew right at him itssable cloak billowing out in the air like the wings of a monstrous bat 
 quickly luke rolled to one side not taking his eyes off vader as the vast blackfigure landed soundlessly next to him 
 your future lies with me skywalker vader hissed looming over the crouchingyouth now you will embrace the dark side knew this to be true 
 no luke yelled trying to fight off the evil presence 
 there is much did not tell you vader continued come i willcomplete your training 
 influence was incredibly strong it seemed to luke like a thing alive 
 listen to him luke told himself he is trying to trick me to lead meastray to lead me to the dark side of the force just like ben warned me 
 luke began to back away from the advancing sith lord behind the youth thehydraulic elevator cover silently opened ready to receive him 
 die first luke proclaimed 
 that be necessary the dark lord suddenly lunged at luke with hislightsaber so forcefully that the youth lost his balance and tumbled into the gapingopening 
 vader turned away from the and casually deactivated his too easy he shrugged perhaps you are not as strong as the emperorthought 
 as he spoke molten metal began to pour into the opening behind him his back was still turned something rose in a blur upward 
 time will tell luke quietly replied to remark 
 the dark lord spun around at this point in the freezing process the subjectcertainly be able to speak vader glanced around the room and then turnedhis helmeted head up toward the ceiling 
 hanging from some hoses draped across the ceiling luke was leaped some five meters into the air to escape the carbonite 
 impressive vader admitted your agility is impressive 
 luke dropped back to the platform on the other side of the steaming pit hereached his hand out and his sword lying on another part of the platform flew backinto his grip immediately the lightsaber ignited 
 sword sprang to life at the very same moment ben has taught youwell you have controlled your fear now release your anger i destroyed yourfamily take your revenge 
 but this time luke was cautious and more controlled if he could subdue hisanger as he had finally controlled his fear he would not be swayed 
 remember the training luke cautioned himself remember what yoda out all hatred and anger and receive the force 
 gaining control over his negative feelings luke began to advance goading he lunged at vader and after a quick exchange began to forcehim back 
 your hatred can give you the power to destroy me vader tempted use it 
 luke began to realize just how awesomely powerful his dark enemy was andsoftly told himself i will not become a slave to the dark side of the force andmoved cautiously toward vader 
 as luke approached vader slowly moved backward in retreat luke lunged athim with a powerful swing but when vader blocked it he lost his balance and fellinto the outer rim of steaming pipes 
 knee nearly buckled with the exhaustion of battling his fearsomeopponent he gathered his strength and cautiously moved to the edge and lookeddown but he saw no sign of vader switching off his lightsaber and hooking itinto his belt luke lowered himself into the pit 
 he dropped to the floor of the pit and found himself in a large control andmaintenance room that overlooked the reactor powering the entire city lookingaround the chamber he noticed a large window standing silhouetted in front of it wasthe unmoving figure of darth vader 
 luke slowly moved closer to the window and reignited his lightsaber 
 but vader did not light his own sword nor did he make any effort to defendhimself as luke drew nearer the dark only weapon in fact was histempting voice attack he goaded the young jedi destroy me 
 confused by ploy luke hesitated 
 only by taking your revenge can you save yourself 
 luke stood locked in place should he act on words and thus used theforce as a tool of revenge or should he step away from this battle now hoping foranother chance to fight vader when he had gained better control 
 no how could he delay the opportunity to destroy this evil being here washis chance now and he must not delay 
 there might never again be such an opportunity 
 luke grasped his deadly lightsaber in both hands tightly gripping the smoothhandle like an ancient broadsword and raising the weapon to deliver the blow thatwould slay this masked horror 
 but before he could swing a large piece of machinery detached itself from thewall behind him and came hurtling at his back turning instantly luke flashed hislightsaber and cut the thing in half and the two massive pieces crashed to the floor 
 a second piece of machinery sped toward the youth and he again used the forceto deflect it the weighty object bounced away as if it had struck an unseen a large pipe came tumbling toward him through the air but even as lukerepelled that enormous object tools and pieces of machinery came flying at him fromall directions then wires that pulled themselves out of the walls came twisting andsparking and whipping at him 
 bombarded on all sides luke did what he could to deflect the assault but he wasbeginning to get bloodied and bruised in the attempt 
 another large piece of machinery glanced off body and crashed out thelarge window letting in the screaming wind suddenly everything in the room wasblown about and the fierce wind lashed body and filled the room with abansheelike howl 
 and in the very center of the room standing still and triumphant was darthvader 
 you are beaten the dark lord of the sith gloated it is useless to will join me or you will join in death 
 as vader spoke those words a final piece of heavy machinery soared through theair striking the young jedi and knocking him through the broken became a great blur as the wind carried him tossing and rolling until hemanaged to grab hold of a beam with one hand 
 when the wind subsided a bit and his vision cleared luke realized that he washanging from the gantry of the reactor shaft outside the control room when hegazed down he saw what appeared to be an endless abyss a wave of dizzinessswept over him and he squeezed his eyes closed in an effort to keep from panicking 
 compared to the podlike reactor from which he hung luke was no more than aspeck of squirming matter while the pod one of many jutting from thecircular inner no more than a speck itself in comparison withthe rest of the immense chamber 
 grasping the beam firmly with only one hand luke managed to hook hislightsaber on to his belt and then grab the beam with both hands hoisting on it justin time to see darth vader walking toward him down the shaft 
 as vader approached luke the public address system began to blare echoingthrough the cavernous rooms fugitives heading toward platform secure alltransports all security forces on alert 
 walking menacingly toward luke vader predicted your friends will neverescape and neither will you 
 vader took another step and luke immediately raised his sword ready to renewthe battle 
 you are beaten vader stated with horrifying certainty and finality it isuseless to resist 
 but luke did resist he lunged at the dark lord with a vicious blow bringinghis sizzling laser blade to crash onto armor and sear through to the staggered from the blow and it seemed to luke that he was in pain but onlyfor a moment then once again vader began to move toward him 
 taking another step the dark lord warned let yourself be destroyed was 
 luke was breathing hard cold sweat dropping from his forehead but thesound of name instilled a sudden resolve in him 
 calm he reminded himself be calm 
 but the grimly cloaked specter stalked toward him along the narrow gentry andit seemed he wanted the young life 
 or worse his fragile soul 
 lando leia chewbacca and the droids hurried down a corridor they turneda corner and saw the door to the landing platform standing open through it theyglimpsed the millennium falcon waiting for their escape but suddenly the doorslammed shut ducking into an alcove the group saw a squad of stormtrooperscharging them their laser guns blasting as they ran chunks of wall and floorshattered and flew into the air with the impact of the ricocheting energy beams 
 chewbacca growled returning the stormtroopers fire with savage wookiee covered leia who punched desperately at the control panel but the doorfailed to budge 
 artoo threepio called the control panel you can override the alertsystem 
 threepio gestured at the panel urging the little robot to hurry and pointing out acomputer socket on the control board 
 scooted toward the control panel beeping and whistling as hescurried to help 
 twisting his body to avoid the burning laser bolts lando feverishly worked toconnect this comlink to the intercom 
 this is calrissian he broadcast over the system the empire is takingcontrol of the city i advise you to leave before more imperial troops arrive 
 he switched off the communicator lando knew that he had done what hecould to warn his people his job now was to get his friends safely off the planet 
 meanwhile artoo removed a connector cover and inserted an extendedcomputer arm into the waiting socket the droid issued a short beep that suddenlyturned into a wild robot scream he began to quiver his circuits lighting up in a maddisplay of flashing brilliance and every orifice in his hull spewing smoke landoquickly pulled artoo away from the power socket as the droid began to cool off hedirected a few wilted beeps way 
 well next time you pay more attention threepio replied defensively supposed to know power sockets from computer feeds an interpreter 
 anybody else got any ideas leia shouted as she stood firing at the attackingstormtroopers 
 come on lando answered over the din of the battle try another way 
 the wind that shrieked through the reactor shaft entirely absorbed the sounds ofthe clashing lightsabers 
 luke moved agilely across the gantry and took refuge beneath a huge instrumentpanel to evade his pursuing foe but vader was there in an instant his lightsaberthrashing down like a pulsating guillotine blade cutting the instrument complex complex began to fall but was abruptly caught by the wind and blown upward 
 an instant of distraction was all vader needed as the instrument panel floatedaway luke involuntarily glanced at it at that second the dark laser bladecame slashing down across hand cutting it and sending the lightsaberflying 
 the pain was excruciating luke smelled the terrible odor of his own searedflesh and squeezed his forearm beneath his armpit to try to stop the agony hestepped backward along the gantry until he reached its extreme end stalked all thewhile by the apparition 
 abruptly ominously the wind subsided and luke realized he had nowhereelse to go 
 there is no escape the dark lord of the sith warned looming over luke likea black angel of death make me destroy you you are strong with theforce now you must learn to use the dark side join me and together we will bemore powerful than the emperor come i will complete your training and we willrule the galaxy together 
 luke refused to give in to taunts i will never join you 
 if you only knew the power of the dark side vader continued told you what happened to your father did he 
 mention of his father aroused anger he told me enough he told me you killed him 
 no vader replied calmly i am your father 
 stunned luke stared with disbelief at the warrior and then pulledaway at this revelation the two warriors stood staring at one another father andson 
 no no not true luke said refusing to believe what he had justheard impossible 
 search your feelings vader said sounding like an evil version of yoda youknow it to be true 
 then vader turned off the blade of his lightsaber and extended a steady andinviting hand 
 bewildered and at words luke shouted no no 
 vader continued persuasively luke you can destroy the emperor he hasforeseen this it is your destiny join me and together we can rule the galaxy asfather and son come with me it is the only way 
 mind whirled with those words everything was finally beginning tocoalesce in his brain or was it he wondered if vader were telling him the training of yoda the teaching of saintly old ben his own strivings forgood and his abhorrence of evil if everything he had fought for were no more than alie 
 he want to believe vader tried convincing himself that it was vader wholied to somehow he could feel the truth in the dark words but ifdarth vader did speak the truth why he wondered had ben kenobi lied to his mind screamed louder than any wind the dark lord could ever summonagainst him 
 the answers no longer seemed to matter 
 his father 
 with the calmness that ben himself and yoda the jedi master had taught skywalker made perhaps what might be his final decision of all shouted as he stepped out into the empty abyss beneath him for all itsunperceived depth luke might have been falling to another galaxy 
 darth vader moved to the end of the gantry to watch as luke tumbled away astrong wind began to blow billowing black cloak out behind him as he stoodlooking over the edge 
 body quickly plunged downward toppling head over foot thewounded jedi desperately reached out to grab at something to stop his fall 
 the dark lord watched until he saw the body sucked into a largeexhaust pipe in the side of the reactor shaft when luke vanished vader quicklyturned and hurried off the platform 
 luke sped through the exhaust shaft trying to grab the sides to slow his the smooth shiny sides of the pipe had no or ridges for luke to grasp 
 at last he came to the end of the tunnellike pipe his feet striking hard against acircular grill the grill which opened over an apparently bottomless drop wasknocked out by the impact of momentum and he felt his body starts to slideout through the opening frantically clawing at the smooth interior of the pipe lukebegan to call out for assistance 
 benben help me he pleaded desperately 
 even as he called out he felt his fingers slip along the inside of the pipe whilehis body inched ever closer to the yawning opening 
 cloud city was in chaos 
 as soon as lando broadcast was heard throughout the city itsresidents began to panic some of them packed a few belongings others just rushedout into the streets seeking escape soon the streets were filled with running humansand aliens rushing chaotically through the city imperial stormtroopers charged afterthe fleeing inhabitants exchanging laser fire with them in a raging clamorous battle 
 in one of the central corridors lando leia and chewbacca held off asquad of stormtroopers by blasting heavy rounds of laser bolts at the imperial was urgent that lando and the others hold their ground for they had come uponanother entrance that would lead them to the landing platform if only artoosucceeded in opening the door 
 artoo was trying to remove the plate from this control panel butbecause of the noise and distraction of the laser fire blasting around him it wasdifficult for the little droid to concentrate on his work he beeped to himself as heworked sounding a bit befuddled to threepio 
 what are you talking about threepio called to him not interested inthe hyperdrive on the millennium falcon fixed just tell the computer to openthe door 
 then as lando leia and the wookiee edged toward the door dodging heavyimperial laser fire artoo beeped triumphantly and the door snapped open 
 artoo you did it threepio exclaimed the droid would have applauded hadhis other arm been attached i never doubted you for a second 
 hurry lando shouted or never make it 
 the helpful r unit came through once again as the others dashed through theentrance the stout robot sprayed out a thick dense as the clouds surroundingthis obscured his friends from the encroaching stormtroopers beforethe cloud had cleared lando and the others were racing toward platform 
 the stormtroopers followed blasting at the small band of fugitive bolting towardthe millennium falcon chewbacca and the robots boarded the freighter whilelando and leia covered them with their blasters cutting down still more of warriors 
 when the roar of the engines started and then rose to whine lando and leia discharged a few more bolts of brilliant they sprinted up the ramp they entered the pirate ship and the main hatchwayclosed behind them and as the ship began to move they heard a barrage ofimperial laser fire that sounded as if the entire planet were splitting apart at itsfoundations 
 luke could no longer slow his inexorable slide out the exhaust pipe 
 he slid the final few centimeters and then dropped through the cloudyatmosphere his body spinning and his arms flailing to grip on to something solid 
 after what seemed like forever he caught hold of an electronic weather vane thatjutted out from the bowllike underside of cloud city winds buffeted him andclouds swirled around him as he held on tightly to the weather vane but hisstrength was beginning to fail he think he could hang like the gaseous very much longer 
 all was very quiet in the millennium falcon cockpit 
 leia just catching her breath from their close escape sat in han of him rushed to her mind but she tried not to worry about him tried not tomiss him 
 behind the princess looking over her shoulder out the front windscreen stood asilent and exhausted lando calrissian 
 slowly the ship began to move picking up speed as it coursed along the landingplatform 
 the giant wookiee in his old chair threw a series of switches thatbrought a dancing array of lights across the main control panel pulling thethrottle chewbacca began to guide the ship upward to freedom 
 clouds rushed by the cockpit windows and everyone finally breathed with reliefas the millennium falcon soared into a twilight sky 
 luke managed to hook one of his legs over the electronic weather vane whichcontinued to support his weight but air from the exhaust pipe rushed at it difficult for him to keep from slipping off the vane 
 ben he moaned in agony ben 
 darth vader strode onto the empty landing platform and watched the speck thatwas the millennium falcon disappears in the far distance 
 he turned to his two aides bring my ship in he commanded and then heleft black robes flowing behind him to prepare for his journey 
 somewhere near the supporting stalk of cloud city luke spoke his mind on one whom he thought cared for him and might somehowcome to his aid he called leia hear me pitifully he cried out once 
 just then a large piece of the weather vane broke off and went hurtling off intothe clouds far below luke tightened his grip on what remained of the vane andstrained to hold on in the blast of air rushing at him from the pipe above 
 it looks like three fighters lando said to chewbacca as they watched configurations we can outdistance them easily he the capabilities of the freighter as well as han solo at leia he mourned the passing of his administratorship i know thatsetup was too good to last he moaned going to miss it 
 but leia seemed to be in a daze she acknowledge stared straight ahead of her as if transfixed then out of her dreamlike spoke luke she said as if responding to something she heard 
 what lando asked 
 got to go back she said urgently chewie head for the bottom of thecity 
 lando looked at her in astonishment wait a minute not going backthere 
 the wookiee barked for once in agreement with lando 
 no argument leia said firmly assuming the dignity of one accustomed tohaving her orders obeyed just do it a command 
 what about those fighters lando argued as he pointed to three tie fightersclosing in on them he looked to chewbacca for support 
 but growling menacingly chewbacca conveyed that he knew who was incommand now 
 okay okay lando quietly acquiesced 
 with all the grace and speed for which the millennium falcon was famed theship banked through the clouds and turned back toward the city and as thefreighter continued on what could become a suicide run the three pursuing tiefighters matched its turn 
 luke skywalker was unaware of the millennium approach barelyconscious he somehow maintained his hold on the creaking and swaying weathervane the device bent under the weight of his body then completely broke off fromits foundation and sent luke tumbling helplessly through the sky and this time heknew there would be nothing for him to cling to as he fell 
 look lando exclaimed indicating a figure plunging in the falling 
 leia managed to remain calm she knew that panic would doom them all getunder him chewie she told the pilot luke 
 chewbacca immediately responded and carefully eased the millennium falconon a descent trajectory 
 lando leia called turning to him open the top hatch 
 as he rushed out of the cockpit lando thought it a strategy worthy of solohimself 
 chewbacca and leia could see plunging body more clearly and thewookiee guided the ship toward him as chewie retarded the speeddrastically the plummeting form skimmed the windscreen and then landed with athud against the outer hull 
 lando opened the upper hatch in the distance he glimpsed the three tiefighters approaching the falcon their laser guns brightening the twilight sky withstreaks of hot destruction lando stretched his body out of the hatch and reached tograsp the battered warrior and pull him inside the ship just then falcon lurched as abolt exploded near it and almost threw body overboard but lando caughthis hand and held on tightly 
 the millennium falcon veered away from cloud city and soared through thethick billowing cloud cover swerving to avoid the blinding flak from the tiefighters princess leia and the wookiee pilot struggled to keep their ship explosions burst all around the cockpit the din competing with as he frantically worked the controls 
 leia switched on the intercom lando is he all right she shouted over thenoise in the cockpit lando do you hear me 
 from the rear of the cockpit she heard a voice that luke replied faintly 
 leia and chewbacca turned to see luke bettered and bloodied and wrapped in ablanket being helped into the cockpit by lando the princess jumped up from herchair and hugged him ecstatically chewbacca still trying to guide the ship out ofthe tie fighter range of fire threw back his head and barked in jubilation 
 behind the millennium falcon the planet of clouds was receding farther in thedistance but the tie fighters kept up their close pursuit firing their laser weaponsand rocking the pirate craft with each hit 
 working diligently in the hold struggled against theconstant lunging and tossing to reassemble his golden friend meticulously trying toundo the mistakes of the wookiee the little droid beeped as heperformed the intricate task 
 very good the protocol droid praised his head was on properly and hissecond arm was nearly completely reattached good as new 
 artoo beeped apprehensively 
 no artoo worry sure make it this time 
 but in the cockpit lando was not so optimistic he saw the warning lights onthe control panel begin to flash suddenly alarms all over the ship went on thedeflector shields are going he reported to leia and chewbacca 
 leia looked over shoulder and noticed another blip ominously had appeared on radarscope another ship she said much to cut us off 
 luke quietly gazed out the cockpit window toward the starry void almost tohimself he said vader 
 admiral piett approached vader who stood on the bridge of this the greatest ofall imperial star destroyers and stared out the windows 
 be in range of the tractor beam in moments the admiral reportedconfidently 
 and their hyperdrive has been deactivated vader asked 
 right after they were captured sir 
 good the giant figure said prepare for the boarding and setyour weapons for stun 
 the millennium falcon so far had managed to evade its tie fighter could it escape attack from the ominous star destroyer that pressed toward closer 
 we have any room for mistakes leia said tensely watching the largeblip on the monitors 
 if my men said they fixed this baby they fixed it lando assured her nothing to worry about 
 sounds familiar leia mused to herself 
 the ship was rocked again by the concussion of another laser explosion but atthat moment a green light began flashing on the control panel 
 the coordinates are set chewie leia said now or never 
 the wookiee barked in agreement he was ready for the hyperdrive escape 
 punch it lando yelled 
 chewbacca shrugged as if to say it was worth a try he pulled back on throttle suddenly altering the sound of the ion engines all on boardwere praying in human and droid fashion that the system would work they had noother hope of escape but abruptly the sound choked and died and chewbaccaroared a howl of desperate frustration 
 again the hyperdrive system had failed them 
 and still the millennium falcon lurched with the tie fighters fire 
 from his imperial star destroyer darth vader watched in fascination as the tiefighters relentlessly fired at the millennium falcon ship was closing in onthe fleeing would not be long before the dark lord had skywalkercompletely in his power 
 and luke sensed it too quietly he gazed out knowing that vader was his victory over the weakened jedi would soon be complete his body wasbattered was exhausted his spirit was prepared to succumb to his fate there wasno reason to fight any was nothing left to believe in 
 ben he whispered in utter despair why you tell me 
 lando tried to adjust some controls and chewbacca leaped from his chair to racethe hold leia took seat and helped lando as they flew the falconthrough the exploding flak 
 as the wookiee ran into the hold he passed artoo who was still working onthreepio the r unit began to beep in great consternation as he scanned thewookiee frantically trying to fix the hyperdrive system 
 i said doomed the panicked threepio told artoo the are malfunctioning again 
 artoo beeped as he connected a leg 
 how could you know wrong the golden droid scoffed my foot and stop chattering on so 
 voice sounded in the hold through the intercom chewie check thesecondary deviation controls 
 chewbacca dropped into the pit he fought to loosen a section of thepaneling with an enormous wrench but it failed to budge roaring in gripped the tool like a club and bashed the panel with all his strength 
 suddenly the cockpit control panel sprayed lando and the princess with ashower of sparks they jumped back in their seats in surprise but luke to notice anything happening around him his head hung in discouragementand deep pain 
 i be able to resist him he muttered softly 
 again lando banked the millennium falcon trying to shed the pursuers butthe distance between the freighter and tie fighters was narrowing by the moment 
 in the millennium hold artoo raced to a control panel leaving anoutraged threepio to stand sputtering in place on his one attached leg artooworked swiftly relying only on mechanical instinct to reprogram the circuit flashed brightly with each of adjustments when suddenly from deepwithin the hyperspeed engines a new and powerful hum resonatedthroughout the ship 
 the freighter tilted suddenly sending the whistling r droid rolling across thefloor into the pit to land on the startled chewbacca 
 lando who had been standing near the control panel tumbled back against thecockpit wall but as he fell back he saw the stars outside become blinding infinitestreaks of light 
 we did it lando yelled triumphantly 
 the millennium falcon had shot victoriously into hyperdrive 
 darth vader stood silently he gazed at the black void where a moment millennium falcon had been his deep black silence brought terror to the twomen standing near him admiral piett and his captain waited chills of fear coursingthrough their bodies and wondered how soon they would feel the invisible viseliketalons around their throats 
 but the dark lord did not move he stood silently contemplative with hishands behind his back then he turned and slowly walked off the bridge his eboncloak billowing behind him

 book one 
 chapter xxvii 
 
 at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the dining room where his princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by a strange caprice of his was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michael ivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was not a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone else 
 in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmen one behind each chair stood waiting for the prince to enter the head butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate of a ruling prince in a crown an alleged descendant of rurik and ancestor of the bolkonskis prince andrew looking again at that genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing 
 how thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had come up to him 
 princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question 
 everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense 
 princess mary could not understand the boldness of her criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck 
 glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sit down sit down michael ianovich 
 he indicated a place beside him to his a footman moved the chair for her 
 ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure been in a hurry bad 
 he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only and not with his eyes 
 you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said 
 the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retailing the town gossip 
 countess apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out she said growing more and more lively 
 as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivanovich 
 well michael ivanovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me what forces are being collected against him while you and i never thought much of him 
 michael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i had said such things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow 
 he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the architect 
 and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any potemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure 
 the past always seems good said he but did not suvorov himself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to escape 
 who told you that who cried the prince suvorov and he jerked away his plate which tikhon briskly caught suvorov consider prince andrew two frederick and suvorov moreau moreau would have been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand but he had the on his hands it would have puzzled the devil himself when you get there find out what those are suvorov manage them so what chance has michael kutuzov no my dear boy he continued you and your generals get on against buonaparte have to call in the french so that birds of a feather may fight together the german pahlen has been sent to new york in america to fetch the frenchman moreau he said alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian service wonderful were the potemkins suvorovs and orlovs germans no lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or i have outlived mine may god help you but see what will happen buonaparte has become a great commander among them hm 
 i at all say that all the plans are good said prince andrew i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as you like but all the same bonaparte is a great generall 
 michael ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician here he says same thing 
 to be sure your excellency replied the architect 
 the prince again laughed his frigid laugh 
 buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has got splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and only idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody has beaten the germans they beat no one except one another he made his reputation fighting them 
 and the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to him bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his son made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion he listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and political events 
 you think an old man and understand the present state of affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i sleep at night come now where has this great commander of yours shown his skill he concluded 
 that would take too long to tell answered the son 
 well then go to your buonaparte mademoiselle bourienne another admirer of that emperor of yours he exclaimed in excellent french 
 you know prince i am not a bonapartist 
 dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a laugh still more so he quitted the table 
 the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her and now at princess mary when they left the table she took her arm and drew her into another room 
 what a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why i am afraid of him 
 oh he is so kind answered princess mary

 chapter 
 
 seven days glided away every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of edgar state the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours catherine we would fain have deluded yet but her own quick spirit refused to delude her it divined in secret and brooded on the dreadful probability gradually ripening into certainty she had not the heart to mention her ride when thursday came round i mentioned it for her and obtained permission to order her out of doors for the library where her father stopped a short time brief period he could bear to sit his chamber had become her whole world she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow or seated by his side her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death 
 he had a fixed idea i guessed by several observations he let fall that as his nephew resembled him in person he would resemble him in mind for letters bore few or no indications of his defective character and i through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account 
 we deferred our excursion till the afternoon a golden afternoon of august every breath from the hills so full of life that it seemed whoever respired it though dying might revive face was just like the and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares 
 we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before my young mistress alighted and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback but i dissented i risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute so we climbed the slope of heath together master heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion not the animation of high spirits though nor yet of joy it looked more like fear 
 it is late he said speaking short and with difficulty is not your father very ill i thought you come 
 why you be candid cried catherine swallowing her greeting why cannot you say at once you want me it is strange linton that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose apparently to distress us both and for no reason besides 
 linton shivered and glanced at her half supplicating half ashamed but his patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour 
 my father is very ill she said and why am i called from his bedside why you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished i keep it come i desire an explanation playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind and i dance attendance on your affectations now 
 my affectations he murmured what are they for sake catherine look so angry despise me as much as you please i am a worthless cowardly wretch i be scorned enough but too mean for your anger hate my father and spare me for contempt 
 nonsense cried catherine in a passion foolish silly boy and there he trembles as if i were really going to touch him you bespeak contempt linton anybody will have it spontaneously at your service get off i shall return home it is folly dragging you from the hearthstone and do we pretend let go my frock if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened you should spurn such pity ellen tell him how disgraceful this conduct is rise and degrade yourself into an abject 
 with streaming face and an expression of agony linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror 
 oh he sobbed i cannot bear it catherine catherine a traitor too and i dare not tell you but leave me and i shall be killed dear catherine my life is in your hands and you have said you loved me and if you did it harm you not go then kind sweet good catherine and perhaps you will let me die with you 
 my young lady on witnessing his intense anguish stooped to raise him the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed 
 consent to what she asked to stay tell me the meaning of this strange talk and i will you contradict your own words and distract me be calm and frank and confess at once all that weighs on your heart you injure me linton would you you let any enemy hurt me if you could prevent it believe you are a coward for yourself but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend 
 but my father threatened me gasped the boy clasping his attenuated fingers and i dread dread him i dare not tell 
 oh well said catherine with scornful compassion keep your secret no coward save yourself not afraid 
 her magnanimity provoked his tears he wept wildly kissing her supporting hands and yet could not summon courage to speak out i was cogitating what the mystery might be and determined catherine should never suffer to benefit him or anyone else by my goodwill when hearing a rustle among the ling i looked up and saw mr heathcliff almost close upon us descending the heights he cast a glance towards my companions though they were sufficiently near for sobs to be audible but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides and the sincerity of which i avoid doubting he said 
 it is something to see you so my house nelly how are you at the grange let us hear the rumour goes he added in a lower tone that edgar linton is on his deathbed perhaps they exaggerate his illness 
 no my master is dying i replied it is true enough a sad thing it will be for us all but a blessing for him 
 how long will he last do you think he asked 
 i know i said 
 because he continued looking at the two young people who were fixed under his appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head and catherine could not move on his that lad yonder seems determined to beat me and thank his uncle to be quick and go before him hallo has the whelp been playing that game long i did give him some lessons about snivelling is he pretty lively with miss linton generally 
 lively has shown the greatest distress i answered to see him i should say that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills he ought to be in bed under the hands of a doctor 
 he shall be in a day or two muttered heathcliff but up linton get up he shouted grovel on the ground there up this moment 
 linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear caused by his glance towards him i suppose there was nothing else to produce such humiliation he made several efforts to obey but his little strength was annihilated for the time and he fell back again with a moan mr heathcliff advanced and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf 
 now said he with curbed ferocity getting angry and if you command that paltry spirit of you get up directly 
 i will father he panted only let me alone or i shall faint done as you wished sure catherine will tell you that been cheerful ah keep by me catherine give me your hand 
 take mine said his father stand on your feet there lend you her arm right look at her you would imagine i was the devil himself miss linton to excite such horror be so kind as to walk home with him will you he shudders if i touch him 
 linton dear whispered catherine i go to wuthering heights papa has forbidden me not harm you why are you so afraid 
 i can never that house he answered not to it without you 
 stop cried his father respect filial scruples nelly take him in and follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay 
 do well replied i but i must remain with my mistress to mind your son is not my business 
 you are very stiff said heathcliff i know that but force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity come then my hero are you willing to return escorted by me 
 he approached once more and made as if he would seize the fragile being but shrinking back linton clung to his cousin and implored her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial however i disapproved i hinder her indeed how could she have refused him herself what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning but there he was powerless under its grip and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy we reached the threshold catherine walked in and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair expecting her out immediately when mr heathcliff pushing me forward exclaimed 
 my house is not stricken with the plague nelly and i have a mind to be hospitable today sit down and allow me to shut the door 
 he shut and locked it also i started 
 you shall have tea before you go home he added i am by myself hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure and though used to being alone rather have some interesting company if i can get it miss linton take your seat by him i give you what i have the present is hardly worth accepting but i have nothing else to offer it is linton i mean how she does stare odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty i should treat a slow vivisection of those two as an amusement 
 he drew in his breath struck the table and swore to himself by hell i hate them 
 not afraid of you exclaimed catherine who could not hear the latter part of his speech she stepped close up her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution give me that key i will have it she said i eat or drink here if i were starving 
 heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table he looked up seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness or possibly reminded by her voice and glance of the person from whom she inherited it she snatched at the instrument and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers but her action recalled him to the present he recovered it speedily 
 now catherine linton he said stand off or i shall knock you down and that will make mrs dean mad 
 regardless of this warning she captured his closed hand and its contents again we will go she repeated exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax and finding that her nails made no impression she applied her teeth pretty sharply heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face he opened them suddenly and resigned the object of dispute but ere she had well secured it he seized her with the liberated hand and pulling her on his knee administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on the side of the head each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat had she been able to fall 
 at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously you villain i began to cry you villain a touch on the chest silenced me i am stout and soon put out of breath and what with that and the rage i staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate or to burst a blood vessel the scene was over in two minutes catherine released put her two hands to her temples and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on she trembled like a reed poor thing and leant against the table perfectly bewildered 
 i know how to chastise children you see said the scoundrel grimly as he stooped to repossess himself of the key which had dropped to the floor go to linton now as i told you and cry at your ease i shall be your father the father have in a few you shall have plenty of that you can bear plenty no weakling you shall have a daily taste if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again 
 cathy ran to me instead of linton and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap weeping aloud her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle as quiet as a mouse congratulating himself i dare say that the correction had lighted on another than him mr heathcliff perceiving us all confounded rose and expeditiously made the tea himself the cups and saucers were laid ready he poured it out and handed me a cup 
 wash away your spleen he said and help your own naughty pet and mine it is not poisoned though i prepared it going out to seek your horses 
 our first thought on his departure was to force an exit somewhere we tried the kitchen door but that was fastened outside we looked at the were too narrow for even little figure 
 master into i cried seeing we were regularly imprisoned you know what your diabolical father is after and you shall tell us or box your ears as he has done your 
 yes linton you must tell said catherine it was for your sake i came and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse 
 give me some tea thirsty and then tell you he answered mrs dean go away i like you standing over me now catherine you are letting your tears fall into my cup i drink that give me another 
 catherine pushed another to him and wiped her face i felt disgusted at the little composure since he was no longer in terror for himself the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there and that accomplished he had no further immediate fears 
 papa wants us to be married he continued after sipping some of the liquid and he knows your papa let us marry now and afraid of my dying if we wait so we are to be married in the morning and you are to stay here all night and if you do as he wishes you shall return home next day and take me with you 
 take you with her pitiful changeling i exclaimed you marry why the man is mad or he thinks us fools every one and do you imagine that beautiful young lady that healthy hearty girl will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you are you cherishing the notion that anybody let alone miss catherine linton would have you for a husband you want whipping for bringing us in here at all with your dastardly puling tricks look so silly now a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery and your imbecile conceit 
 i did give him a slight shaking but it brought on the cough and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping and catherine rebuked me 
 stay all night no she said looking slowly round ellen burn that door down but get out 
 and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly but linton was up in alarm for his dear self again he clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing 
 you have me and save me not let me come to the grange oh darling catherine you go and leave me after all you must obey my must 
 i must obey my own she replied and relieve him from this cruel suspense the whole night what would he think be distressed already either break or burn a way out of the house be quiet in no danger but if you hinder i love papa better than you 
 the mortal terror he felt of mr anger restored to the boy his eloquence catherine was near distraught still she persisted that she must go home and tried entreaty in her turn persuading him to subdue his selfish agony while they were thus occupied our gaoler 
 your beasts have trotted off he said linton snivelling again what has she been doing to you come done and get to bed in a month or two my lad be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand pining for pure love are you not nothing else in the world and she shall have you there to bed zillah be here tonight you must undress yourself hush hold your noise once in your own room not come near you you fear by chance managed tolerably look to the rest 
 he spoke these words holding the door open for his son to pass and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze the lock was heathcliff approached the fire where my mistress and i stood silent catherine looked up and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness but he scowled on her and muttered 
 oh you are not afraid of me your courage is well disguised you seem damnably afraid 
 i am afraid now she replied because if i stay papa will be miserable and how can i endure making him heathcliff let me go home i promise to marry linton papa would like me to and i love should you wish to force me to do what willingly do of myself 
 let him dare to force you i cried law in the land thank god there is though we be in an place inform if he were my own son and felony without benefit of clergy 
 silence said the ruffian to the devil with your clamour i want you to speak miss linton i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable i shall not sleep for satisfaction you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next hours than informing me that such an event would follow as to your promise to marry linton take care you shall keep it for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled 
 send ellen then to let papa know safe exclaimed catherine weeping bitterly or marry me now poor papa ellen think lost what shall we do 
 not he think you are tired of waiting on him and run off for a little amusement answered heathcliff you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age arid that you would weary of nursing a sick man and that man only your father catherine his happiest days were over when your days began he cursed you i dare say for coming into the world i did at least and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it join him i love you how should i weep away as far as i can see it will be your chief diversion hereafter unless linton make amends for other losses and your provident parent appears to fancy he may his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his and kind to her when he got her careful and paternal but linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself linton can play the little tyrant well undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness when you get home again i assure you 
 right there i said explain your character show his resemblance to yourself and then i hope miss cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice 
 i much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now he answered because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner and you along with her till your master dies i can detain you both quite concealed here if you doubt encourage her to retract her word and have an opportunity of judging 
 not retract my word said catherine marry him within this hour if i may go to thrushcross grange afterwards mr heathcliff a cruel man but not a fiend and you from mere malice destroy irrevocably all my happiness if papa thought i had left him on purpose and if he died before i returned could i bear to live given over crying but going to kneel here at your knee and not get up and not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me no turn away do look see nothing to provoke you i hate you not angry that you struck me have you never loved anybody in all your life uncle never ah you must look once so wretched you help being sorry and pitying me 
 keep your fingers off and move or kick you cried heathcliff brutally repulsing her rather be hugged by a snake how the devil can you dream of fawning on me i detest you 
 he shrugged his shoulders shook himself indeed as if his flesh crept with aversion and thrust back his chair while i got up and opened my mouth to commence a downright torrent of abuse but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered it was growing heard a sound of voices at the garden gate our host hurried out instantly he had his wits about him we had not there was a talk of two or three minutes and he returned alone 
 i thought it had been your cousin hareton i observed to catherine i wish he would arrive who knows but he might take our part 
 it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange said heathcliff overhearing me you should have opened a lattice and called out but i could swear that chit is glad you glad to be obliged to stay certain 
 at learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without control and he allowed us to wail on till nine then he bid us go upstairs through the kitchen to chamber and i whispered my companion to obey perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there or into a garret and out by its skylight the window however was narrow like those below and the garret trap was safe from our attempts for we were fastened in as before we neither of us lay down catherine took her station by the lattice and watched anxiously for morning a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest i seated myself in a chair and rocked to and fro passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty from which it struck me then all the misfortunes of all my employers sprang it was not the case in reality i am aware but it was in my imagination that dismal night and i thought heathcliff himself less guilty than i 
 at seven he came and inquired if miss linton had risen 
 she ran to the door immediately and answered yes here then he said opening it and pulling her out i rose to follow but he turned the lock again i demanded my release 
 be patient he replied send up your breakfast in a while 
 i thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily and catherine asked why i was still shut up he answered i must try to endure it another hour and they went away i endured it two or three hours at length i heard a footstep not 
 brought you something to eat said a voice oppen t door 
 complying eagerly i beheld hareton laden with food enough to last me all day 
 tak it he added thrusting the tray into my hand 
 stay one minute i began 
 nay cried he and retired regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him 
 and there i remained enclosed the whole day and the whole of the next night and another and another five nights and four days i remained altogether seeing nobody but hareton once every morning and he was a model of a jailer surly and dumb and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion

 chapter 
 
 fortune suddenly smiled upon jo and dropped a good luck penny in her path not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise 
 every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room put on her scribbling suit and fall into a vortex as she expressed it writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul for till that was finished she could find no peace her scribbling suit consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will and a cap of the same material adorned with a cheerful red bow into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family who during these periods kept their distance merely popping in their heads to ask with interest does genius burn jo they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead it was a sign that hard work was going on in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off and cast upon the floor and cast upon the floor at such times the intruder silently withdrew and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow did anyone dare address jo 
 she did not think herself a genius by any means but when the writing fit came on she gave herself up to it with entire abandon and led a blissful life unconscious of want care or bad weather while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh sleep forsook her eyes meals stood untasted day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times and made these hours worth living even if they bore no other fruit the devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two and then she emerged from her vortex hungry sleepy cross or despondent 
 she was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort miss crocker to a lecture and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea it was a course the lecture on the pyramids and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx 
 they were early and while miss crocker set the heel of her stocking jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them on her left were two matrons with massive foreheads and bonnets to match discussing rights and making tatting beyond sat a pair of humble lovers artlessly holding each other by the hand a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna on her right her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper 
 it was a pictorial sheet and jo examined the work of art nearest her idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat while two infuriated young gentlemen with unnaturally small feet and big stabbing each other close by and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open pausing to turn a page the lad saw her looking and with boyish good nature offered half his paper saying bluntly want to read it a story 
 jo accepted it with a smile for she had never outgrown her liking for lads and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love mystery and murder for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday and when the invention fails a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae leaving the other half to exult over their downfall 
 prime it asked the boy as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion 
 i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried returned jo amused at his admiration of the trash 
 i should think i was a pretty lucky chap if i could she makes a good living out of such stories they say and he pointed to the name of mrs northbury under the title of the tale 
 do you know her asked jo with sudden interest 
 no but i read all her pieces and i know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page 
 guess she does she knows just what folks like and gets paid well for writing it 
 here the lecture began but jo heard very little of it for while professor sands was prosing away about belzoni cheops scarabei and hieroglyphics she was covertly taking down the address of the paper and boldly resolving to try for the prize offered in its columns for a sensational story by the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke she had built up a splendid fortune for herself not the first founded on paper and was already deep in the concoction of her story being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder 
 she said nothing of her plan at home but fell to work next day much to the disquiet of her mother who always looked a little anxious when genius took to burning jo had never tried this style before contenting herself with very mild romances for the spread eagle her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect and supplied plot language and costumes her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it and having located it in lisbon she wound up with an earthquake as a striking and appropriate denouement the manuscript was privately dispatched accompanied by a note modestly saying that if the tale get the prize which the writer hardly dared expect she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth 
 six weeks is a long time to wait and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret but jo did both and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away for on opening it a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry if the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature i think he would devote his leisure hours if he has any to that amusement for jo valued the letter more than the money because it was encouraging and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something though it was only to write a sensation story 
 a prouder young woman was seldom seen than she when havingcomposed herself she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand the check in the other announcing that she had won the prize of course there was a great jubilee and when the story came everyone read and praised it though after her father had told her that the language was good the romance fresh and hearty and the tragedy quite thrilling he shook his head and said in his unworldly way 
 you can do better than this jo aim at the highest and never mind the money 
 i think the money is the best part of it what will you do with such a fortune asked amy regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye 
 send beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two answered jo promptly 
 to the seaside they went after much discussion and though beth come home as plump and rosy as could be desired she was much better while mrs march declared she felt ten years younger so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money and fell to work with a cheery spirit bent on earning more of those delightful checks she did earn several that year and began to feel herself a power in the house for by the magic of a pen her rubbish turned into comforts for them all the daughter paid the bill a phantom hand put down a new carpet and the curse of the coventrys proved the blessing of the marches in the way of groceries and gowns 
 wealth is certainly a most desirable thing but poverty has its sunny side and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand and to the inspiration of necessity we owe half the wise beautiful and useful blessings of the world jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny 
 little notice was taken of her stories but they found a market and encouraged by this fact she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune having copied her novel for the fourth time read it to all her confidential friends and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers she at last disposed of it on condition that she would cut it down one third and omit all the parts which she particularly admired 
 now i must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold pay for printing it myself or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what i can for it fame is a very good thing to have in the house but cash is more convenient so i wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject said jo calling a family council 
 spoil your book my girl for there is more in it than you know and the idea is well worked out let it wait and ripen was her advice and he practiced what he preached having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow 
 it seems to me that jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting said mrs march criticism is the best test of such work for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults and help her to do better next time we are too partial but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful even if she gets but little money 
 yes said jo knitting her brows just it been fussing over the thing so long i really know whether good bad or indifferent it will be a great help to have cool impartial persons take a look at it and tell me what they think of it 
 i leave a word out of it spoil it if you do for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people and it will be all a muddle if you explain as you go on said meg who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written 
 but mr allen says leave out the explanations make it brief and dramatic and let the characters tell the story interrupted jo turning to the note 
 do as he tells you he knows what will sale and we make a good popular book and get as much money as you can when got a name you can afford to digress and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels said amy who took a strictly practical view of the subject 
 well said jo laughing if my people are philosophical and metaphysical it my fault for i know nothing about such things except what i hear father say sometimes if got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance so much the better for me now beth what do you say 
 i should so like to see it printed soon was all beth said and smiled in saying it but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor which chilled heart for a minute with a forboding fear and decided her to make her little venture soon 
 so with spartan firmness the young authoress laid her on her table and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre in the hope of pleasing everyone she took advice and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody 
 her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description out therefore it came and with it many necessary links in the story meg admired the tragedy so jo piled up the agony to suit her while amy objected to the fun and with the best intentions in life jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story then to complicate the ruin she cut it down one third and confidingly sent the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate 
 well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover 
 you said mother that criticism would help me but how can it when so contradictory that i know whether written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dismay the next this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness 
 all is sweet pure and healthy continued the perplexed authoress the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters now as i had no theory of any kind believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i see how this critic can be right another says one of the best american novels which has appeared for years i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it for the pleasure and the money i wish printed the whole or not at all for i do hate to be so misjudged 
 her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally yet it was a hard time for sensitive jo who meant so well and had apparently done so ill but it did her good for those whose opinion had real value gave her the critism which is an best education and when the first soreness was over she could laugh at her poor little book yet believe in it still and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received 
 not being a genius like keats it kill me she said stoutly and got the joke on my side after all for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced charmingly natural tender and true so comfort myself with that and when ready up again and take another

lionfish nov chapter padfoot returnscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 one of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake which meant that ron was getting to share limelight for once harry noticed that version of events changed subtly with every retelling at first he gave what seemed to be the truth it tallied with story anyway dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor office first assuring them that they would be quite safe and would awake when they were back above the water one week later however ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up 
 
 but i had my wand hidden up my sleeve he assured padma patil who seemed to be a lot keener on ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors i taken those any time i wanted 
 
 what were you going to do snore at them said hermione waspishly people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood 
 
 ears went red and thereafter he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events 
 
 as they entered march the weather became drier but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds there were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course the brown owl that harry had sent to sirius with the dates of the hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way harry had no sooner torn off reply than it took flight clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again 
 
 letter was almost as short as the previous one 
 
 be at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade past dervish and banges at two on saturday afternoon bring as much food as you can 
 he come back to hogsmeade said ron incredulously 
 
 it looks like it it said hermione 
 
 i believe him said harry tensely if caught 
 
 made it so far though he said ron and not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore 
 
 harry folded up the letter thinking if he was honest with himself he really wanted to see sirius again he therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon double potions feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy gang of slytherin girls all of them were looking at something harry see and sniggering heartily pansys face peered excitedly around broad back as harry ron and hermione approached 
 
 there they are there they are she giggled and the knot of slytherins broke apart harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands witch weekly the moving picture on the front showed a witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand 
 
 you might find something to interest you in there granger pansy said loudly and she threw the magazine at hermione who caught it looking startled at that moment the dungeon door opened and snape beckoned them all inside 
 
 hermione harry and ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual once snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk at last in the center pages hermione found what they were looking for harry and ron leaned in closer a color photograph of harry headed a short piece entitled 
 
 harry secret heartache 
 a boy like no other perhaps yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence writes rita skeeter deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts hermione granger little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss 
 miss granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to have a taste for famous wizards that harry alone cannot satisfy since the arrival at hogwarts of viktor krum bulgarian seeker and hero of the last world quidditch cup miss granger has been toying with both boys affections krum who is openly smitten with the devious miss granger has already invited her to visit him in bulgaria over the summer holidays and insists that he has never felt this way about any other girl 
 however it might not be miss doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys interest 
 really ugly says pansy parkinson a pretty and vivacious student but be well up to making a love potion quite brainy i think how doing it 
 love potions are of course banned at hogwarts and no doubt albus dumbledore will want to investigate these claims in the meantime harry potters must hope that next time he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate 
 i told you ron hissed at hermione as she stared down at the article i told you not to annoy rita skeeter made you out to be some sort of of scarlet woman 
 
 hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter scarlet woman she repeated shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ron 
 
 what my mum calls them ron muttered his ears going red 
 
 if the best rita can do losing her touch said hermione still giggling as she threw witch weekly onto the empty chair beside her what a pile of old rubbish 
 
 she looked over at the slytherins who were all watching her and harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave and she harry and ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their potion 
 
 something funny though said hermione ten minutes later holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles how could rita skeeter have known 
 
 known what said ron quickly you been mixing up love potions have you 
 
 be stupid hermione snapped starting to pound up her beetles again no justhow did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summer 
 
 hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided eyes 
 
 what said ron dropping his pestle with a loud clunk 
 
 he asked me right after pulled me out of the lake 
 
 hermione muttered after got rid of his head madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they hear and he said if i doing anything over the summer would i like to 
 
 and what did you say said ron who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk a good six inches from his bowl because he was looking at hermione 
 
 and he did say never felt the same way about anyone else hermione went on going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her but how could rita skeeter have heard him she thereor was she maybe she has got an invisibility cloak maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task 
 
 and what did you say ron repeated pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk 
 
 well i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were okay to 
 
 fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is miss granger said an icy voice right behind them and all three of them jumped i must ask you not to discuss it in my class ten points from gryffindor 
 
 snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking the whole class was now looking around at them malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harry 
 
 ahreading magazines under the table as well snape added snatching up the copy of witch weekly a further ten points from gryffindoroh but of course black eyes glittered as they fell on rita article potter has to keep up with his press cuttings 
 
 the dungeon rang with the slytherins laughter and an unpleasant smile curled thin mouth to fury he began to read the article aloud 
 
 harry secret heartachedear dear potter ailing you now a boy like no other perhaps 
 
 harry could feel his face burning snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the slytherins a hearty laugh the article sounded ten times worse when read by snape even hermione was blushing scarlet now 
 
 harry must hope that next time he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate how very touching sneered snape rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the slytherins well i think i had better separate the three of you so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives weasley you stay here miss granger over there beside miss parkinson potter that table in front of my desk move now 
 
 furious harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table snape followed sat down at his desk and watched harry unload his cauldron determined not to look at snape harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles imagining each one to have face 
 
 all this press attention seems to have inflated your already head potter said snape quietly once the rest of the class had settled down again 
 
 harry answer he knew snape was trying to provoke him he had done this before no doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from gryffindor before the end of the class 
 
 you might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you snape went on so quietly that no one else could hear him harry continued to pound his scarab beetles even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder but i care how many times your picture appears in the papers to me potter you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him 
 
 harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots his hands were shaking slightly out of anger but he kept his eyes down as though he hear what snape was saying to him 
 
 so i give you fair warning potter snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice celebrity or not if i catch you breaking into my office one more time 
 
 i been anywhere near your office said harry angrily forgetting his feigned deafness 
 
 lie to me snape hissed his fathomless black eyes boring into boomslang skin gillyweed both come from my private stores and i know who stole them 
 
 harry stared back at snape determined not to blink or to look guilty in truth he stolen either of these things from snape hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year they had needed it for the polyjuice potion and while snape had suspected harry at the time he had never been able to prove it dobby of course had stolen the gillyweed 
 
 i know what talking about harry lied coldly 
 
 you were out of bed on the night my office was broken into snape hissed i know it potter now moody might have joined your fan club but i will not tolerate your behavior one more nighttime stroll into my office potter and you will pay 
 
 right said harry coolly turning back to his ginger roots bear that in mind if i ever get the urge to go in there 
 
 eyes flashed he plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes for one wild moment harry thought snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him then he saw that snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion harry stared at it 
 
 do you know what this is potter snape said his eyes glittering dangerously again 
 
 no said harry with complete honesty this time 
 
 it is veritaserum a truth potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear said snape viciously now the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry guidelines but unless you watch your step you might just find that my hand slips he shook the crystal bottle slightly right over your evening pumpkin juice and then potterthen find out whether been in my office or not 
 
 harry said nothing he turned back to his ginger roots once more picked up his knife and started slicing them again he like the sound of that truth potion at all nor would he put it past snape to slip him some he repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if snape did itquite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble hermione and dobby for a start there were all the other things he was concealinglike the fact that he was in contact with siriusand his insides squirmed at the thought how he felt about tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of book and start drinking only from a private hip flask 
 
 there was a knock on the dungeon door 
 
 enter said snape in his usual voice 
 
 the class looked around as the door opened professor karkaroff came in everyone watched him as he walked up toward desk he was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated 
 
 we need to talk said karkaroff abruptly when he had reached snape he seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots listening hard 
 
 talk to you after my lesson karkaroff snape muttered but karkaroff interrupted him 
 
 i want to talk now while you slip off severus been avoiding me 
 
 after the lesson snape snapped 
 
 under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if poured out enough armadillo bile harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them karkaroff looked extremely worried and snape looked angry 
 
 karkaroff hovered behind desk for the rest of the double period he seemed intent on preventing snape from slipping away at the end of class keen to hear what karkaroff wanted to say harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door 
 
 so urgent he heard snape hiss at karkaroff 
 
 this said karkaroff and harry peering around the edge of his cauldron saw karkaroff pull up the sleeve of his robe and show snape something on his inner forearm 
 
 well said karkaroff still making every effort not to move his lips do you see never been this clear never since 
 
 put it away snarled snape his black eyes sweeping the classroom 
 
 but you must have noticed karkaroff began in an agitated voice 
 
 we can talk later karkaroff spat snape potter what are you doing 
 
 clearing up my armadillo bile professor said harry innocently straightening up and showing snape the sodden rag he was holding 
 
 karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon he looked both worried and angry not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry snape harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell ron and hermione what he had just witnessed 
 
 
 
 they left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds the weather was milder than it had been all year and by the time they arrived in hogsmeade all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders the food sirius had told them to bring was in bag they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs a loaf of bread and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table 
 
 they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for dobby where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly then at half past one they made their way up the high street past dervish and banges and out toward the edge of the village 
 
 harry had never been in this direction before the winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around hogsmeade the cottages were fewer here and their gardens larger they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow hogsmeade lay then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane waiting for them its front paws on the topmost bar was a very large shaggy black dog which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar 
 
 hello sirius said harry when they had reached him 
 
 the black dog sniffed bag eagerly wagged its tail once then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain harry ron and hermione climbed over the stile and followed 
 
 sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks it was easy for him with his four paws but harry ron and hermione were soon out of breath they followed sirius higher up onto the mountain itself for nearly half an hour they climbed a steep winding and stony path following wagging tail sweating in the sun the shoulder straps of bag cutting into his shoulders 
 
 then at last sirius slipped out of sight and when they reached the place where he had vanished they saw a narrow fissure in the rock they squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool dimly lit cave tethered at the end of it one end of his rope around a large rock was buckbeak the hippogriff half gray horse half giant eagle fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them all three of them bowed low to him and after regarding them imperiously for a moment buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck harry however was looking at the black dog which had just turned into his godfather 
 
 sirius was wearing ragged gray robes the same ones he had been wearing when he had left azkaban his black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire and it was untidy and matted once more he looked very thin 
 
 chicken he said hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor 
 
 harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread 
 
 thanks said sirius opening it grabbing a drumstick sitting down on the cave floor and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth been living off rats mostly steal too much food from hogsmeade draw attention to myself 
 
 he grinned up at harry but harry returned the grin only reluctantly 
 
 you doing here sirius he said 
 
 fulfilling my duty as godfather said sirius gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way worry about it pretending to be a lovable stray 
 
 he was still grinning but seeing the anxiety in face said more seriously i want to be on the spot your last letterwell just say things are getting fishier been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out and by the looks of things not the only one getting worried 
 
 he nodded at the yellowing daily prophets on the cave floor and ron picked them up and unfolded them harry however continued to stare at sirius 
 
 what if they catch you what if seen 
 
 you three and dumbledore are the only ones around here who know an animagus said sirius shrugging and continuing to devour the chicken leg 
 
 ron nudged harry and passed him the daily prophets there were two the first bore the headline mystery illness of bartemius crouch the second ministry witch still missing minister of magic now personally involved 
 
 harry scanned the story about crouch phrases jumped out at him been seen in public since novemberhouse appears desertedst hospital for magical maladies and injuries decline commentministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness 
 
 making it sound like dying said harry slowly but he be that ill if he managed to get up here 
 
 my brothers personal assistant ron informed sirius he says crouch is suffering from overwork 
 
 mind you he did look ill last time i saw him up close said harry slowly still reading the story the night my name came out of the goblet 
 
 getting his comeuppance for sacking winky he said hermione an edge to her voice she was stroking buckbeak who was crunching up chicken bones i bet he wishes he done it now bet he feels the difference now not there to look after him 
 
 obsessed with ron muttered to sirius casting hermione a dark look sirius however looked interested 
 
 crouch sacked his 
 
 yeah at the quidditch world cup said harry and he launched into the story of the dark appearance and winky being found with wand clutched in her hand and mr fury when harry had finished sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave 
 
 let me get this straight he said after a while brandishing a fresh chicken leg you first saw the elfin the top box she was saving crouch a seat right 
 
 right said harry ron and hermione together 
 
 but crouch turn up for the match 
 
 no said harry i think he said been too busy 
 
 sirius paced all around the cave in silence then he said harry did you check your pockets for your wand after left the top box 
 
 erm harry thought hard no he said finally i need to use it before we got in the forest and then i put my hand in my pocket and all that was in there were my omnioculars he stared at sirius are you saying whoever conjured the mark stole my wand in the top box 
 
 possible said sirius 
 
 winky steal that wand hermione insisted 
 
 the elf the only one in that box said sirius his brow furrowed as he continued to pace who else was sitting behind you 
 
 loads of people said harry some bulgarian ministerscornelius fudgethe malfoys 
 
 the malfoys said ron suddenly so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave and buckbeak tossed his head nervously i bet it was lucius malfoy 
 
 anyone else said sirius 
 
 no one said harry 
 
 yes there was there was ludo bagman hermione reminded him 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 i know anything about bagman except that he used to be beater for the wimbourne wasps said sirius still pacing he like 
 
 okay said harry he keeps offering to help me with the triwizard tournament 
 
 does he now said sirius frowning more deeply i wonder why do that 
 
 says taken a liking to me said harry 
 
 hmm said sirius looking thoughtful 
 
 we saw him in the forest just before the dark mark appeared hermione told sirius remember she said to harry and ron 
 
 yeah but he stay in the forest did he said ron the moment we told him about the riot he went off to the campsite 
 
 how know hermione shot back how know where he disapparated to 
 
 come off it said ron incredulously are you saying you reckon ludo bagman conjured the dark mark 
 
 more likely he did it than winky said hermione stubbornly 
 
 told you said ron looking meaningfully at sirius told you obsessed with house 
 
 but sirius held up a hand to silence ron 
 
 when the dark mark had been conjured and the elf had been discovered holding wand what did crouch do 
 
 went to look in the bushes said harry but there anyone else there 
 
 of course sirius muttered pacing up and down of course want to pin it on anyone but his own elfand then he sacked her 
 
 yes said hermione in a heated voice he sacked her just because she stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled 
 
 hermione will you give it a rest with the elf said ron 
 
 sirius shook his head and said got the measure of crouch better than you have ron if you want to know what a mans like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals 
 
 he ran a hand over his unshaven face evidently thinking hard 
 
 all these absences of barty goes to the trouble of making sure his saves him a seat at the quidditch world cup but bother to turn up and watch he works very hard to reinstate the triwizard tournament and then stops coming to that not like crouch if ever taken a day off work because of illness before this eat buckbeak 
 
 know crouch then said harry 
 
 face darkened he suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when harry first met him the night when harry still believed sirius to be a murderer 
 
 oh i know crouch all right he said quietly he was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to azkaban without a trial 
 
 what said ron and hermione together 
 
 kidding said harry 
 
 no not said sirius taking another great bite of chicken crouch used to be head of the department of magical law enforcement you know 
 
 harry ron and hermione shook their heads 
 
 he was tipped for the next minister of magic said sirius a great wizard barty crouch powerfully magical and oh never a voldemort supporter he said reading the look on face no barty crouch was always very outspoken against the dark side but then a lot of people who were against the dark sidewell you too young 
 
 what my dad said at the world cup said ron with a trace of irritation in his voice try us why you 
 
 a grin flashed across thin face 
 
 all right try you he walked once up the cave back again and then said imagine that powerful now you know who his supporters are you know working for him and who you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves scared for yourself and your family and your friends every week news comes of more deaths more disappearances more torturingthe ministry of in disarray they know what to do trying to keep everything hidden from the muggles but meanwhile muggles are dying too terror how it used to be 
 
 well times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others principles been good in the beginning i know he rose quickly through the ministry and he started ordering very harsh measures against supporters the aurors were given new powers powers to kill rather than capture for instance and i the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial crouch fought violence with violence and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects i would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the dark side he had his supporters mind you plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic when voldemort disappeared it looked like only a matter of time until crouch got the top job but then something rather unfortunate happened sirius smiled grimly own son was caught with a group of death eaters managed to talk their way out of azkaban apparently they were trying to find voldemort and return him to power 
 
 son was caught gasped hermione 
 
 yep said sirius throwing his chicken bone to buckbeak flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread and tearing it in half nasty little shock for old barty i magine should have spent a bit more time at home with his family he ought to have left the office early once in a whilegotten to know his own son 
 
 he began to wolf down large pieces of bread 
 
 was his son a death eater said harry 
 
 no idea said sirius still stuffing down bread i was in azkaban myself when he was brought in this is mostly stuff found out since i got out the boy was definitely caught in the company of people bet my life were death eaters but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time just like the 
 
 did crouch try and get his son off hermione whispered 
 
 sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark 
 
 crouch let his son off i thought you had the measure of him hermione anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go he had dedicated his whole life to becoming minister of magic you saw him dismiss a devoted because she associated him with the dark mark again that tell you what like fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial and by all accounts it much more than an excuse for crouch to show how much he hated the boythen he sent him straight to azkaban 
 
 he gave his own son to the dementors asked harry quietly 
 
 right said sirius and he look remotely amused now i saw the dementors bringing him in watched them through the bars in my cell door he have been more than nineteen they took him into a cell near mine he was screaming for his mother by nightfall he went quiet after a few days thoughthey all went quiet in the endexcept when they shrieked in their sleep 
 
 for a moment the deadened look in eyes became more pronounced than ever as though shutters had closed behind them 
 
 so still in azkaban harry said 
 
 no said sirius dully no not in there anymore he died about a year after they brought him in 
 
 he died 
 
 he the only one said sirius bitterly most go mad in there and plenty stop eating in the end they lose the will to live you could always tell when a death was coming because the dementors could sense it they got excited that boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived crouch being an important ministry member he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit that was the last time i saw barty crouch half carrying his wife past my cell she died herself apparently shortly afterward grief wasted away just like the boy crouch never came for his body the dementors buried him outside the fortress i watched them do it 
 
 sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it 
 
 so old crouch lost it all just when he thought he had it made he continued wiping his mouth with the back of his hand one moment a hero poised to become minister of magicnext his son dead his wife dead the family name dishonored and so heard since i escaped a big drop in popularity once the boy had died people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray the conclusion was that his father never cared much for him so cornelius fudge got the top job and crouch was shunted sideways into the department of international magical cooperation 
 
 there was a long silence harry was thinking of the way eyes had bulged as looked down at his disobedient back in the wood at the quidditch world cup this then must have been why crouch had overreacted to winky being found beneath the dark mark it had brought back memories of his son and the old scandal and his fall from grace at the ministry 
 
 moody says crouch is obsessed with catching dark wizards harry told sirius 
 
 yeah heard become a bit of a mania with him said sirius nodding if you ask me he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more death eater 
 
 and he sneaked up here to search office said ron triumphantly looking at hermione 
 
 yes and that make sense at all said sirius 
 
 yeah it does said ron excitedly but sirius shook his head 
 
 listen if crouch wants to investigate snape why he been coming to judge the tournament it would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to hogwarts and keep an eye on him 
 
 so you think snape could be up to something then asked harry but hermione broke in 
 
 look i care what you say dumbledore trusts snape 
 
 oh give it a rest hermione said ron impatiently i know dumbledores brilliant and everything but that mean a really clever dark wizard fool him 
 
 why did snape save life in the first year then why he just let him die 
 
 i dunno maybe he thought dumbledore would kick him out 
 
 what think sirius harry said loudly and ron and hermione stopped bickering to listen 
 
 i think both got a point said sirius looking thoughtfully at ron and hermione ever since i found out snape was teaching here wondered why dumbledore hired him always been fascinated by the dark arts he was famous for it at school slimy oily kid he was sirius added and harry and ron grinned at each other snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year and he was part of a gang of slytherins who nearly all turned out to be death eaters 
 
 sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names 
 
 rosier and wilkes they were both killed by aurors the year before voldemort fell the lestranges a married couple in azkaban avery from what heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying been acting under the imperius curse still at large but as far as i know snape was never even accused of being a death eater not that that means much plenty of them were never caught and certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble 
 
 snape knows karkaroff pretty well but he wants to keep that quiet said ron 
 
 yeah you seen face when karkaroff turned up in potions yesterday said harry quickly karkaroff wanted to talk to snape he says been avoiding him karkaroff looked really worried he showed snape something on his arm but i see what it was 
 
 he showed snape something on his arm said sirius looking frankly bewildered he ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair then shrugged again well no idea what aboutbut if genuinely worried and going to snape for answers 
 
 sirius stared at the cave wall then made a grimace of frustration 
 
 still the fact that dumbledore trusts snape and i know dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people but i just see him letting snape teach at hogwarts if ever worked for voldemort 
 
 why are moody and crouch so keen to get into office then said ron stubbornly 
 
 well said sirius slowly i put it past to have searched every single office when he got to hogwarts he takes his defense against the dark arts seriously moody not sure he trusts anyone at all and after the things seen not surprising say this for moody though he never killed if he could help it always brought people in alive where possible he was tough but he never descended to the level of the death eaters crouch a different matteris he really ill if he is why did he make the effort to drag himself up to office and if he up to what was he doing at the world cup that was so important he turn up in the top box he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament 
 
 sirius lapsed into silence still staring at the cave wall buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor looking for bones he might have overlooked finally sirius looked up at ron 
 
 you say your personal assistant any chance you could ask him if seen crouch lately 
 
 i can try said ron doubtfully better not make it sound like i reckon crouch is up to anything dodgy though percy loves crouch 
 
 and you might try and find out whether got any leads on bertha jorkins while at it said sirius gesturing to the second copy of the daily prophet 
 
 bagman told me they said harry 
 
 yes quoted in the article in there said sirius nodding at the paper blustering on about how bad memory is well maybe changed since i knew her but the bertha i knew forgetful at all quite the reverse she was a bit dim but she had an excellent memory for gossip it used to get her into a lot of trouble she never knew when to keep her mouth shut i can see her being a bit of a liability at the ministry of magicmaybe why bagman bother to look for her for so long 
 
 sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes 
 
 the time 
 
 harry checked his watch then remembered it been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake 
 
 half past three said hermione 
 
 better get back to school sirius said getting to his feet now listen he looked particularly hard at harry i want you lot sneaking out of school to see me all right just send notes to me here i still want to hear about anything odd but not to go leaving hogwarts without permission it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you 
 
 no tried to attack me so far except a dragon and a couple of grindylows harry said but sirius scowled at him 
 
 i breathe freely again when this over and not until june and forget if talking about me among yourselves call me snuffles okay 
 
 he handed harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat buckbeak walk to the edge of the village with you said sirius see if i can scrounge another paper 
 
 he transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave and they walked back down the mountainside with him across the ground and back to the stile here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village harry ron and hermione made their way back into hogsmeade and up toward hogwarts 
 
 wonder if percy knows all that stuff about crouch ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle but maybe he probably just make him admire crouch even more yeah percy loves rules just say crouch was refusing to break them for his own son 
 
 percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors said hermione severely 
 
 i know said ron if he thought we were standing in the way of his really ambitious you know 
 
 they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the great hall 
 
 poor old snuffles said ron breathing deeply he must really like you having to live off rats 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the centaur and the sneakcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 bet you wish you given up divination now you hermione asked parvati smirking 
 
 it was breakfast time two days after the sacking of professor trelawney and parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon they were to have their first lesson with firenze that morning 
 
 not really said hermione indifferently who was reading the daily never really liked horses 
 
 she turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns 
 
 not a horse a centaur said lavender sounding shocked 
 
 a gorgeous centaur sighed parvati 
 
 either way still got four legs said hermione coolly anyway i thought you two were all upset that trelawney had gone 
 
 we are lavender assured her we went up to her office to see her we took her some daffodils not the honking ones that got nice ones 
 
 how is she asked harry 
 
 not very good poor thing said lavender sympathetically she was crying and saying rather leave the castle for ever than stay here where umbridge is and i blame her umbridge was horrible to her she 
 
 got a feeling umbridge has only just started being horrible said hermione darkly 
 
 impossible said ron who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon she get any worse than been already 
 
 you mark my words going to want revenge on dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her said hermione closing the newspaper especially another you saw the look on her face when she saw firenze 
 
 after breakfast hermione departed for her arithmancy class as harry and ron followed parvati and lavender into the entrance hall heading for divination 
 
 we going up to north tower asked ron looking puzzled as parvati bypassed the marble staircase 
 
 parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder 
 
 how expect firenze to climb that ladder in classroom eleven now it was on the noticeboard yesterday 
 
 classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the entrance hall from the opposite side to the great hall harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom when he entered it right behind ron and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing he was therefore momentarily stunned 
 
 what the 
 
 the classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft dappled green light the students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests and all looking rather nervous in the middle of the clearing where there were no trees stood firenze 
 
 harry potter he said holding out a hand when harry entered 
 
 erhi said harry shaking hands with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile ergood to see you 
 
 and you said the centaur inclining his head it was foretold that we would meet again 
 
 harry noticed there was the shadow of a bruise on chest as he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground he saw they were all looking at him in awe apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating 
 
 when the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket firenze gestured around the room 
 
 professor dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us said firenze when everyone had settled down in imitation of my natural habitat i would have preferred to teach you in the forbidden forest which wasuntil mondaymy home but that is no longer possible 
 
 pleaseer sir said parvati breathlessly raising her not been in there with hagrid not frightened 
 
 it is not a question of your bravery said firenze but of my position i cannot return to the forest my herd has banished me 
 
 herd said lavender in a confused voice and harry knew she was thinking of cows what oh 
 
 comprehension dawned on her face there are more of you she said stunned 
 
 did hagrid breed you like the thestrals asked dean eagerly 
 
 firenze turned his head very slowly to face dean who seemed to realise at once that he had said something very offensive 
 
 i meantsorry he finished in a hushed voice 
 
 centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans said firenze quietly there was a pause then parvati raised her hand again 
 
 please sir why have the other centaurs banished you 
 
 because i have agreed to work for professor dumbledore said firenze they see this as a betrayal of our kind 
 
 harry remembered how nearly four years ago the centaur bane had shouted at firenze for allowing harry to ride to safety on his back he had called him a common mule he wondered whether it had been bane who had kicked firenze in the chest 
 
 let us begin said firenze he swished his long palomino tail raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly and as he did so the light in the room dimmed so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight and stars appeared on the ceiling there were oohs and gasps and ron said audibly blimey 
 
 lie back on the floor said firenze in his calm voice and observe the heavens here is written for those who can see the fortune of our races 
 
 harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling a twinkling red star winked at him from overhead 
 
 i know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in astronomy said calm voice and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us 
 
 professor trelawney did astrology with us said parvati excitedly raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back mars causes accidents and burns and things like that and when it makes an angle to saturn like now she drew a in the air above her that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things 
 
 that said firenze calmly is human nonsense 
 
 hand fell limply to her side 
 
 trivial hurts tiny human accidents said firenze as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor these are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe and are unaffected by planetary movements 
 
 professor trelawney began parvati in a hurt and indignant voice 
 
 is a human said firenze simply and is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind 
 
 harry turned his head very slightly to look at parvati she looked very offended as did several of the people surrounding her 
 
 sybill trelawney may have seen i do not know continued firenze and harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them but she wastes her time in the main on the nonsense humans call i however am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs which is impersonal and impartial we watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there it may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing 
 
 firenze pointed to the red star directly above harry 
 
 in the past decade the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars mars bringer of battle shines brightly above us suggesting that the fight must soon break out again how soon centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves by the observation of fume and flame 
 
 it was the most unusual lesson harry had ever attended they did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor and firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this that it took centaurs years and years to become competent and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly he was nothing like any human teacher harry had ever had his priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew but rather to impress upon them that nothing not even centaurs knowledge was foolproof 
 
 not very definite on anything is he said ron in a low voice as they put out their mallowsweet fire i mean i could do with a few more details about this war about to have you 
 
 the bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle and quite convinced that he was really in the forest the class filed out looking slightly perplexed 
 
 harry and ron were on the point of following them when firenze called harry potter a word please 
 
 harry turned the centaur advanced a little towards him ron hesitated 
 
 you may stay firenze told him but close the door please 
 
 ron hastened to obey 
 
 harry potter you are a friend of are you not said the centaur 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 then give him a warning from me his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon it 
 
 his attempt is not working harry repeated blankly 
 
 and he would do better to abandon it said firenze nodding i would warn hagrid myself but i am banishedit would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now hagrid has troubles enough without a centaurs battle 
 
 hagrid attempting to do said harry nervously 
 
 firenze surveyed harry impassively 
 
 hagrid has recently rendered me a great service said firenze and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures i shall not betray his secret but he must be brought to his senses the attempt is not working tell him harry potter to you 
 
 the happiness harry had felt in the aftermath of the quibbler interview had long since evaporated as a dull march blurred into a squally april his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again 
 
 umbridge had continued attending all care of magical creatures lessons so it had been very difficult to deliver warning to hagrid at last harry had managed it by pretending lost his copy of fantastic beasts and where to find them and doubling back after class one day when repeated words hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy blackened eyes apparently taken aback then he seemed to pull himself together 
 
 nice bloke firenze he said gruffly but he don know what talkin abou on this the comin on fine 
 
 hagrid you up to asked harry seriously because got to be careful umbridge has already sacked trelawney and if you ask me on a roll if doing anything you be be 
 
 things more importan than keepin a job said hagrid though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor don worry abou me harry jus get along now a good lad 
 
 harry had no choice but to leave hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle 
 
 meanwhile as the teachers and hermione persisted in reminding them the owls were drawing ever nearer all the were suffering from stress to some degree but hannah abbott became the first to receive a calming draught from madam pomfrey after she burst into tears during herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now 
 
 if it had not been for the da lessons harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy he sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the room of requirement working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow da members and saw how far they had come indeed harry sometimes wondered how umbridge was going to react when all the members of the da received outstanding in their defence against the dark arts owls 
 
 they had finally started work on patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practise though as harry kept reminding them producing a patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a dementor 
 
 oh be such a killjoy said cho brightly watching her silvery patronus soar around the room of requirement during their last lesson before easter so pretty 
 
 not supposed to be pretty supposed to protect you said harry patiently what we really need is a boggart or something how i learned i had to conjure a patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor 
 
 but that would be really scary said lavender who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand and i it she added angrily 
 
 neville was having trouble too his face was screwed up in concentration but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip 
 
 got to think of something happy harry reminded him 
 
 trying said neville miserably who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat 
 
 harry i think doing it yelled seamus who had been brought along to his first ever da meeting by dean gone but it was definitely something hairy harry 
 
 patronus a shining silver otter was gambolling around her 
 
 they are sort of nice they she said looking at it fondly 
 
 the door of the room of requirement opened and closed harry looked round to see who had entered but there did not seem to be anybody there it was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent next thing he knew something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee he looked down and saw to his very great astonishment dobby the peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats 
 
 hi dobby he said what are wrong 
 
 the eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking the members of the da closest to harry had fallen silent everybody in the room was watching dobby the few patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist leaving the room looking much darker than before 
 
 harry potter sir squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot harry potter sir dobby has come to warn you but the have been warned not to tell 
 
 he ran at the wall harry who had some experience of dobby s habits of made to seize him but dobby merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hats hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy 
 
 happened dobby harry asked grabbing the tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself 
 
 harry potter she she 
 
 dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist harry seized that too 
 
 she dobby 
 
 but he thought he knew surely only one she could induce such fear in dobby the elf looked up at him slightly and mouthed wordlessly 
 
 umbridge asked harry horrified 
 
 dobby nodded then tried to bang his head on knees harry held him at length 
 
 what about her dobbyshe found out about thisabout usabout the da 
 
 he read the answer in the stricken face his hands held fast by harry the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor 
 
 is she coming harry asked quietly 
 
 dobby let out a howl and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor 
 
 yes harry potter yes 
 
 harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf 
 
 what are you waiting for harry bellowed run 
 
 they all pelted towards the exit at once forming a scrum at the door then people burst through harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories it was only ten to nine if they just took refuge in the library or the owlery which were both nearer 
 
 harry come on shrieked hermione from the centre of the knot of people now fighting to get out 
 
 he scooped up dobby who was still attempting to do himself serious injury and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue 
 
 dobbythis is an orderget back down to the kitchen with the other elves and if she asks you whether you warned me lie and say no said harry and i forbid you to hurt yourself he added dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him 
 
 thank you harry potter squeaked dobby and he streaked off harry glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished he started to run right there was a boys bathroom up ahead he could pretend been in there all the time if he could just reach it 
 
 aaargh 
 
 something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt someone behind him was laughing he rolled over on to his back and saw malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly vase 
 
 trip jinx potter he said hey professorprofessor got one 
 
 umbridge came bustling round the far corner breathless but wearing a delighted smile 
 
 him she said jubilantly at the sight of harry on the floor excellent draco excellent oh very goodfifty points to slytherin take him from here stand up potter 
 
 harry got to his feet glaring at the pair of them he had never seen umbridge looking so happy she seized his arm in a grip and turned beaming broadly to malfoy 
 
 you hop along and see if you can round up any more of them draco she said tell the others to look in the libraryanybody out of breathcheck the bathrooms miss parkinson can do the girls onesoff you goand you she added in her softest most dangerous voice as malfoy walked away you can come with me to the office potter 
 
 they were at the stone gargoyle within minutes harry wondered how many of the others had been caught he thought of ronmrs weasley would kill himand of how hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her owls and it had been very first meeting and neville had been getting so good 
 
 fizzing whizzbee sang umbridge the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker but umbridge did not bother to knock she strode straight inside still holding tight to harry 
 
 the office was full of people dumbledore was sitting behind his desk his expression serene the tips of his long fingers together professor mcgonagall stood rigidly beside him her face extremely tense cornelius fudge minister for magic was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire apparently immensely pleased with the situation kingsley shacklebolt and a wizard with very short wiry hair whom harry did not recognise were positioned either side of the door like guards and the freckled bespectacled form of percy weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands apparently poised to take notes 
 
 the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight all of them were alert and serious watching what was happening below them as harry entered a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their ear 
 
 harry pulled himself free of grasp as the door swung shut behind them cornelius fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face 
 
 well he said well well well 
 
 harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster his heart drummed madly inside him but his brain was oddly cool and clear 
 
 he was heading back to gryffindor tower said umbridge there was an indecent excitement in her voice the same callous pleasure harry had heard as she watched professor trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall the malfoy boy cornered him 
 
 did he did he said fudge appreciatively i must remember to tell lucius well potter i expect you know why you are here 
 
 harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes his mouth had opened and the word was when he caught sight of face dumbledore was not looking directly at harryhis eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulderbut as harry stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side 
 
 harry changed direction 
 
 yeno 
 
 i beg your pardon said fudge 
 
 no said harry firmly 
 
 you know why you are here 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 fudge looked incredulously from harry to professor umbridge harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at dumbledore who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink 
 
 so you have no idea said fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm why professor umbridge has brought you to this office you are not aware that you have broken any school rules 
 
 school rules said harry no 
 
 or ministry decrees amended fudge angrily 
 
 not that aware of said harry blandly 
 
 his heart was still hammering very fast it was almost worth telling these lies to watch fudges blood pressure rising but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them if somebody had tipped off umbridge about the da then he the leader might as well be packing his trunk right now 
 
 so news to you is it said fudge his voice now thick with anger that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school 
 
 yes it is said harry hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face 
 
 i think minister said umbridge silkily from beside him we might make better progress if i fetch our informant 
 
 yes yes do said fudge nodding and he glanced maliciously at dumbledore as umbridge left the room nothing like a good witness is there dumbledore 
 
 nothing at all cornelius said dumbledore gravely inclining his head 
 
 there was a wait of several minutes in which nobody looked at each other then harry heard the door open behind him umbridge moved past him into the room gripping by the shoulder friend marietta who was hiding her face in her hands 
 
 be scared dear be frightened said professor umbridge softly patting her on the back quite all right now you have done the right thing the minister is very pleased with you be telling your mother what a good girl been mother minister she added looking up at fudge is madam edgecombe from the department of magical transportation floo network office been helping us police the fires you know 
 
 jolly good jolly good said fudge heartily like mother like daughter eh well come on now dear look up be shy hear what got togalloping gargoyles 
 
 as marietta raised her head fudge leapt backwards in shock nearly landing himself in the fire he cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word sneak 
 
 never mind the spots now dear said umbridge impatiently just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the minister 
 
 but marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically 
 
 oh very well you silly girl tell him snapped umbridge she hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said well minister miss edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me she said that if i proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor sometimes known as the room of requirement i would find out something to my advantage i questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more 
 
 well now said fudge fixing marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look it is very brave of you my dear coming to tell professor umbridge you did exactly the right thing now will you tell me what happened at this meeting what was its purpose who was there 
 
 but marietta would not speak she merely shook her head again her eyes wide and fearful 
 
 we got a for this fudge asked umbridge impatiently gesturing at face so she can speak freely 
 
 i have not yet managed to find one umbridge admitted grudgingly and harry felt a surge of pride in jinxing ability but it matter if she speak i can take up the story from here 
 
 you will remember minister that i sent you a report back in october that potter had met a number of fellow students in the head in hogsmeade 
 
 and what is your evidence for that cut in professor mcgonagall 
 
 i have testimony from willy widdershins minerva who happened to be in the bar at the time he was heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing was quite unimpaired said umbridge smugly he heard every word potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me 
 
 oh so why he prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows what an interesting insight into our justice system 
 
 blatant corruption roared the portrait of the corpulent wizard on the wall behind desk the ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day no sir they did not 
 
 thank you fortescue that will do said dumbledore softly 
 
 the purpose of meeting with these students continued professor umbridge was to persuade them to join an illegal society whose aim was to learn spells and curses the ministry has decided are inappropriate for 
 
 i think find wrong there dolores said dumbledore quietly peering at her over the spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose 
 
 harry stared at him he could not see how dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one if willy widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the head there was simply no escaping it 
 
 oho said fudge bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again yes do hear the latest story designed to pull potter out of trouble go on then dumbledore go on 
 
 willy widdershins was lying was he or was it identical twin in the head that day or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors 
 
 percy weasley let out a hearty laugh 
 
 oh very good minister very good 
 
 harry could have kicked him then he saw to his astonishment that dumbledore was smiling gently too 
 
 cornelius i do not denyand nor i am sure does harrythat he was in the head that day nor that he was trying to recruit students to a defence against the dark arts group i am merely pointing out that dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was at that time illegal if you remember the ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after hogsmeade meeting so he was not breaking any rules at all in the head 
 
 percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy fudge remained motionless in his mouth hanging open 
 
 umbridge recovered first 
 
 all very fine headmaster she said smiling sweetly but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of educational decree number if the first meeting was not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are 
 
 well said dumbledore surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers they certainly would be if they had continued after the decree came into effect do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued 
 
 as dumbledore spoke harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought kingsley whispered something he could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side a gentle something like a draught or bird wings but looking down he saw nothing there 
 
 evidence repeated umbridge with that horrible wide smile have you not been listening dumbledore why do you think miss edgecombe is here 
 
 oh can she tell us about six months worth of meetings said dumbledore raising his eyebrows i was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight 
 
 miss edgecombe said umbridge at once tell us how long these meetings have been going on dear you can simply nod or shake your head sure that make the spots worse have they been happening regularly over the last six months 
 
 harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach this was it they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even dumbledore would be able to shift aside 
 
 just nod or shake your head dear umbridge said coaxingly to marietta come on now that the jinx 
 
 everyone in the room was gazing at the top of face only her eyes were visible between the robes and her curly fringe perhaps it was a trick of the firelight but her eyes looked oddly blank and thento utter amazementmarietta shook her head 
 
 umbridge looked quickly at fudge then back at marietta 
 
 i think you understood the question did you dear asking whether been going to these meetings for the past six months you have you 
 
 again marietta shook her head 
 
 what do you mean by shaking your head dear said umbridge in a testy voice 
 
 i would have thought her meaning was quite clear said professor mcgonagall harshly there have been no secret meetings for the past six months is that correct miss edgecombe 
 
 marietta nodded 
 
 but there was a meeting tonight said umbridge furiously there was a meeting miss edgecombe you told me about it in the room of requirement and potter was the leader was he not potter organised it potterwhy are you shaking your head girl 
 
 well usually when a person shakes their head said mcgonagall coldly they mean no so unless miss edgecombe is using a form of as yet unknown to humans 
 
 professor umbridge seized marietta pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard a split second later dumbledore was on his feet his wand raised kingsley started forwards and umbridge leapt back from marietta waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned 
 
 i cannot allow you to manhandle my students dolores said dumbledore and for the first time he looked angry 
 
 you want to calm yourself madam umbridge said kingsley in his deep slow voice you want to get yourself into trouble now 
 
 no said umbridge breathlessly glancing up at the towering figure of kingsley i mean right shackleboltii forgot myself 
 
 marietta was standing exactly where umbridge had released her she seemed neither perturbed by sudden attack nor relieved by her release she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her 
 
 a sudden suspicion connected to whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into mind 
 
 dolores said fudge with the air of trying to settle something once and for all the meeting tonightthe one we know definitely happened 
 
 yes said umbridge pulling herself together yes well miss edgecombe tipped me off and i proceeded at once to the seventh floor accompanied by certain trustworthy students so as to catch those in the meeting it appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction it does not matter however i have all their names here miss parkinson ran into the room of requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind we needed evidence and the room provided 
 
 and to horror she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the room of wall and handed it to fudge 
 
 the moment i saw name on the list i knew what we were dealing with she said softly 
 
 excellent said fudge a smile spreading across his face excellent dolores and by thunder 
 
 he looked up at dumbledore who was still standing beside marietta his wand held loosely in his hand 
 
 see what named themselves said fudge quietly army 
 
 dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from fudge he gazed at the heading scribbled by hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak then he looked up smiling 
 
 well the game is up he said simply would you like a written confession from me cornelius or will a statement before these witnesses suffice 
 
 harry saw mcgonagall and kingsley look at each other there was fear in both faces he did not understand what was going on and nor apparently did fudge 
 
 statement said fudge slowly whati 
 
 army cornelius said dumbledore still smiling as he waved the list of names before face not army army 
 
 butbut 
 
 understanding blazed suddenly in face he took a horrified step backwards yelped and jumped out of the fire again 
 
 you he whispered stamping again on his smouldering cloak 
 
 right said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 you organised this 
 
 i did said dumbledore 
 
 you recruited these students forfor your army 
 
 tonight was supposed to be the first meeting said dumbledore nodding merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me i see now that it was a mistake to invite miss edgecombe of course 
 
 marietta nodded fudge looked from her to dumbledore his chest swelling 
 
 then you have been plotting against me he yelled 
 
 right said dumbledore cheerfully 
 
 no shouted harry 
 
 kingsley flashed a look of warning at him mcgonagall widened her eyes threateningly but it had suddenly dawned on harry what dumbledore was about to do and he could not let it happen 
 
 noprofessor dumbledore 
 
 be quiet harry or i am afraid you will have to leave my office said dumbledore calmly 
 
 yes shut up potter barked fudge who was still ogling dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight well well welli came here tonight expecting to expel potter and instead 
 
 instead you get to arrest me said dumbledore smiling like losing a knut and finding a galleon it 
 
 weasley cried fudge now positively quivering with delight weasley have you written it all down everything said his confession have you got it 
 
 yes sir i think so sir said percy eagerly whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his 
 
 the bit about how been trying to build up an army against the ministry how been working to destabilise me 
 
 yes sir got it yes said percy scanning his notes joyfully 
 
 very well then said fudge now radiant with glee duplicate your notes weasley and send a copy to the daily prophet at once if we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition percy dashed from the room slamming the door behind him and fudge turned back to dumbledore you will now be escorted back to the ministry where you will be formally charged then sent to azkaban to await trial 
 
 ah said dumbledore gently yes yes i thought we might hit that little snag 
 
 snag said fudge his voice still vibrating with joy i see no snag dumbledore 
 
 well said dumbledore apologetically afraid i do 
 
 oh really 
 
 just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that i am going towhat is the am afraid i am not going to come quietly at all cornelius i have absolutely no intention of being sent to azkaban i could break out of coursebut what a waste of time and frankly i can think of a whole host of things i would rather be doing 
 
 face was growing steadily redder she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water fudge stared at dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened he made a small choking noise then looked round at kingsley and the man with short grey hair who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far the latter gave fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little away from the wall harry saw his hand drift almost casually towards his pocket 
 
 be silly dawlish said dumbledore kindly sure you are an excellent aurori seem to remember that you achieved outstanding in all your newtsbut if you attempt toerbring me in by force i will have to hurt you 
 
 the man called dawlish blinked rather foolishly he looked towards fudge again but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next 
 
 so sneered fudge recovering himself you intend to take on dawlish shacklebolt dolores and myself do you dumbledore 
 
 beard no said dumbledore smiling not unless you are foolish enough to force me to 
 
 he will not be said professor mcgonagall loudly plunging her hand inside her robes 
 
 oh yes he will minerva said dumbledore sharply hogwarts needs you 
 
 enough of this rubbish said fudge pulling out his own wand dawlish shacklebolt take him 
 
 a streak of silver light flashed around the room there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled a hand grabbed the scruff of neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off several of the portraits yelled fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air coughing in the dust harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried no then there was the sound of breaking glass frantically scuffling footsteps a groan and silence 
 
 harry struggled around to see who was him and saw professor mcgonagall crouched beside him she had forced both him and marietta out of way dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them panting slightly harry saw a very tall figure moving towards them 
 
 are you all right dumbledore asked 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall getting up and dragging harry and marietta with her 
 
 the dust was clearing the wreckage of the office loomed into view desk had been overturned all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor their silver instruments in pieces fudge umbridge kingsley and dawlish lay motionless on the floor fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them singing softly 
 
 unfortunately i had to hex kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said dumbledore in a low voice he was remarkably quick on the uptake modifying miss memory like that while everyone was looking the other way thank him for me you minerva 
 
 now they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicateyou must act as though no time has passed as though they were merely knocked to the ground they will not remember 
 
 where will you go dumbledore whispered professor mcgonagall grimmauld place 
 
 oh no said dumbledore with a grim smile i am not leaving to go into hiding fudge will soon wish never dislodged me from hogwarts i promise you 
 
 professor dumbledore harry began 
 
 he did not know what to say first how sorry he was that he had started the da in the first place and caused all this trouble or how terrible he felt that dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion but dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word 
 
 listen to me harry he said urgently you must study occlumency as hard as you can do you understand me do everything professor snape tells you and practise it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreamsyou will understand why soon enough but you must promise me 
 
 the man called dawlish was stirring dumbledore seized wrist 
 
 rememberclose your mind 
 
 but as fingers closed over skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike dumbledore to bite him to hurt him 
 
 you will understand whispered dumbledore 
 
 fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him dumbledore released harry raised his hand and grasped the long golden tail there was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone 
 
 where is he yelled fudge pushing himself up from the floor where is he 
 
 i know shouted kingsley also leaping to his feet 
 
 well he have disapparated cried umbridge you do it from inside this school 
 
 the stairs cried dawlish and he flung himself upon the door wrenched it open and disappeared followed closely by kingsley and umbridge fudge hesitated then got slowly to his feet brushing dust from his front there was a long and painful silence 
 
 well minerva said fudge nastily straightening his torn shirtsleeve afraid this is the end of your friend dumbledore 
 
 you think so do you said professor mcgonagall scornfully 
 
 fudge seemed not to hear her he was looking around at the wrecked office a few of the portraits hissed at him one or two even made rude hand gestures 
 
 better get those two off to bed said fudge looking back at professor mcgonagall with a dismissive nod towards harry and marietta 
 
 professor mcgonagall said nothing but marched harry and marietta to the door as it swung closed behind them harry heard phineas voice 
 
 you know minister i disagree with dumbledore on many counts but you cannot deny got style

 once back under the starry sky harry heaved dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet sodden and shivering weight still upon him harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination hogsmeade closing his eyes gripping arm as tightly as he could he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression 
 
 he knew it had worked before he opened his eyes the smell of salt the sea breeze had gone he and dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark high street in hogsmeade for one horrible moment imagination showed him more inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring all was still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows 
 
 we did it professor harry whispered with difficulty he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest we did it we got the horcrux 
 
 dumbledore staggered against him for a moment harry thought that his inexpert apparition had thrown dumbledore then he saw his face paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp 
 
 sir are you all right 
 
 been better said dumbledore weakly though the corners of his mouth twitched that potion was no health drink 
 
 and to horror dumbledore sank on to the ground 
 
 okay sir going to be all right worry 
 
 he looked around desperately for help but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing 
 
 we need to get you up to the school sir madam pomfrey 
 
 no said is professor snape whom i need but i do not think i can walk very far just yet 
 
 rightsir going to knock on a door find a place you can staythen i can run and get madam 
 
 severus said dumbledore clearly i need severus 
 
 all right then snapebut going to have to leave you for a moment so i can 
 
 before harry could make a move however he heard running footsteps his heart leapt somebody had seen somebody knew they needed helpand looking around he saw madam rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on fluffy slippers wearing a silk embroidered with dragons 
 
 i saw you apparate as i was pulling my bedroom curtains thank goodness thank goodness i think what tobut wrong with albus 
 
 she came to a halt panting and stared down at dumbledore 
 
 hurt said harry madam rosmerta can he come into the three broomsticks while i go up to the school and get help for him 
 
 you go up there alone you you seen 
 
 if you help me support him said harry not listening to her i think we can get him inside 
 
 what has happened asked dumbledore rosmerta wrong 
 
 thethe dark mark albus 
 
 and she pointed into the sky in the direction of hogwarts dread flooded harry at the sound of the words he turned and looked 
 
 there it was hanging in the sky above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark death eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building wherever they had murdered 
 
 when did it appear asked dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon shoulder as he struggled to his feet 
 
 must have been minutes ago it there when i put the cat out but when i got upstairs 
 
 we need to return to the castle at once said dumbledore rosmerta and though he staggered a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation we need transportbrooms 
 
 got a couple behind the bar she said looking very frightened shall i run and fetch 
 
 no harry can do it 
 
 harry raised his wand at once 
 
 accio brooms 
 
 a second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height 
 
 rosmerta please send a message to the ministry said dumbledore as he mounted the broom nearest him it might be that nobody within hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong harry put on your invisibility cloak 
 
 harry pulled his cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom madam rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as harry and dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air as they sped towards the castle harry glanced sideways at dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the dark mark seemed to have acted upon dumbledore like a stimulant he was bent low over his broom his eyes fixed upon the mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air and harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lungs driving all other discomfort from his mind 
 
 how long had they been away had ron hermione and luck run out by now was it one of them who had caused the mark to be set over the school or was it neville or luna or some other member of the da and if it was he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds would he be responsible again for the death of a friend 
 
 as they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier harry heard over the whistling of the night air in his ears dumbledore muttering in some strange language again he thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so that they could enter at speed the dark mark was glittering directly above the astronomy tower the highest of the castle did that mean the death had occurred there 
 
 dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around 
 
 the ramparts were deserted the door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed there was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body 
 
 what does it mean harry asked dumbledore looking up at the green skull with its tongue glinting evilly above them is it the real mark has someone definitely beenprofessor 
 
 in the dim green glow from the mark harry saw dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand 
 
 go and wake severus said dumbledore faintly but clearly tell him what has happened and bring him to me do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak i shall wait here 
 
 but 
 
 you swore to obey me harrygo 
 
 harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side he looked round at dumbledore who gestured to him to retreat harry backed away drawing his wand as he did so 
 
 the door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 body became instantly rigid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak he could not understand how it had happenedexpelliarmus was not a freezing charm 
 
 then by the light of the mark he saw wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself 
 
 standing against the ramparts very white in the face dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress he merely looked across at his disarmer and said good evening draco 
 
 malfoy stepped forwards glancing around quickly to check that he and dumbledore were alone his eyes fell upon the second broom 
 
 who else is here 
 
 a question i might ask you or are you acting alone 
 
 harry saw pale eyes shift back to dumbledore in the greenish glare of the mark 
 
 no he said got there are death eaters here in your school tonight 
 
 well well said dumbledore as though malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project very good indeed you found a way to let them in did you 
 
 yeah said malfoy who was panting right under your nose and you never realised 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore yet forgive me where are they now you seem unsupported 
 
 they met some of your guard having a fight down below they be long i came on ahead got a job to do 
 
 well then you must get on and do it my dear boy said dumbledore softly 
 
 there was silence harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible paralysed body staring at the two of them his ears straining to hear sounds of the death eaters distant fight and in front of him draco malfoy did nothing but stare at albus dumbledore who incredibly smiled 
 
 draco draco you are not a killer 
 
 how do you know said malfoy at once 
 
 he seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded harry saw him flush in the greenish light 
 
 you know what capable of said malfoy more forcefully you know what done 
 
 oh yes i do said dumbledore mildly you almost killed katie bell and ronald weasley you have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year forgive me draco but they have been feeble attempts so feeble to be honest that i wonder whether your heart has been really in it 
 
 it has been in it said malfoy vehemently been working on it all year and tonight 
 
 somewhere in the depths of the castle below harry heard a muffled yell malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder 
 
 somebody is putting up a good fight said dumbledore conversationally but you were saying yes you have managed to introduce death eaters into my school which i admit i thought impossible how did you do it 
 
 but malfoy said nothing he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as harry was 
 
 perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone suggested dumbledore what if your has been thwarted by my guard as you have perhaps realised there are members of the order of the phoenix here tonight too and after all you really need help i have no wand at the moment i cannot defend myself 
 
 malfoy merely stared at him 
 
 i see said dumbledore kindly when malfoy neither moved nor spoke you are afraid to act until they join you 
 
 not afraid snarled malfoy though he still made no move to hurt you who should be scared 
 
 but why i think you will kill me draco killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe so tell me while we wait for your friends how did you smuggle them in here it seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it 
 
 malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit he gulped and took several deep breaths glaring at dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the heart then as though he could not help himself he said i had to mend that broken vanishing cabinet that no used for years the one montague got lost in last year 
 
 aaaah 
 
 sigh was half a groan he closed his eyes for a moment 
 
 that was clever there is a pair i take it 
 
 the in borgin and burkes said malfoy and they make a kind of passage between them montague told me that when he was stuck in the hogwarts one he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school and sometimes what was going on in the shop as if the cabinet was travelling between them but he make anyone hear him in the end he managed to apparate out even though never passed his test he nearly died doing it everyone thought it was a really good story but i was the only one who realised what it meanteven borgin know i was the one who realised there could be a way into hogwarts through the cabinets if i fixed the broken one 
 
 very good murmured dumbledore so the death eaters were able to pass from borgin and burkes into the school to help you a clever plan a very clever plan and as you say right under my nose 
 
 yeah said malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from praise yeah it was 
 
 but there were times dumbledore went on there when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet and you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance i might drink 
 
 yeah well you still realise who was behind that stuff did you sneered malfoy as dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and harry struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him 
 
 as a matter of fact i did said dumbledore i was sure it was you 
 
 why you stop me then malfoy demanded 
 
 i tried draco professor snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders 
 
 he been doing your orders he promised my mother 
 
 of course that is what he would tell you draco but 
 
 a you stupid old man he working for you you just think he is 
 
 we must agree to differ on that draco it so happens that i trust professor snape 
 
 well losing your grip then sneered malfoy been offering me plenty of helpwanting all the glory for himselfwanting a bit of the are you doing did you do the necklace that was stupid it could have blown everything but i told him what been doing in the room of requirement going to wake up tomorrow and all be over and he be the dark favourite any more be nothing compared to me nothing 
 
 very gratifying said dumbledore mildly we all like appreciation for our own hard work of course but you must have had an accomplice all the same someone in hogsmeade someone who was able to slip katie thetheaaaah 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep 
 
 of course rosmerta how long has she been under the imperius curse 
 
 got there at last have you malfoy taunted 
 
 there was another yell from below rather louder than the last malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at dumbledore who went on so poor rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied and the poisoned mead well naturally rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to slughorn believing that it was to be my christmas present yes very neat very neat poor mr filch would not of course think to check a bottle of tell me how have you been communicating with rosmerta i thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored 
 
 enchanted coins said malfoy as though he was compelled to keep talking though his wand hand was shaking badly i had one and she had the other and i could send her messages 
 
 that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves army used last year asked dumbledore his voice was light and conversational but harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it 
 
 yeah i got the idea from them said malfoy with a twisted smile i got the idea of poisoning the mead from the mudblood granger as well i heard her talking in the library about filch not recognising potions 
 
 please do not use that offensive word in front of me said dumbledore 
 
 malfoy gave a harsh laugh 
 
 you care about me saying mudblood when about to kill you 
 
 yes i do said dumbledore and harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright but as for being about to kill me draco you have had several long minutes now we are quite alone i am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me and still you have not acted 
 
 mouth contorted involuntarily as though he had tasted something very bitter 
 
 now about tonight dumbledore went on i am a little puzzled about how it happened you knew that i had left the school but of course he answered his own question rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you off using your ingenious coins sure 
 
 right said malfoy but she said you were just going for a drink be back 
 
 well i certainly did have a drink and i came back after a fashion mumbled dumbledore so you decided to spring a trap for me 
 
 we decided to put the dark mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see been killed said malfoy and it worked 
 
 well yes and no said dumbledore but am i to take it then that nobody has been murdered 
 
 dead said malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it one of your people i know who it was dark i stepped over the body i was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your phoenix lot got in the way 
 
 yes they do that said dumbledore 
 
 there was a bang and shouts from below louder than ever it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where dumbledore malfoy and harry stood and heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest someone was dead malfoy had stepped over the body but who was it 
 
 there is little time one way or another said dumbledore so let us discuss your options draco 
 
 my options said malfoy loudly standing here with a about to kill you 
 
 my dear boy let us have no more pretence about that if you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means 
 
 i got any options said malfoy and he was suddenly as white as dumbledore got to do it kill me kill my whole family 
 
 i appreciate the difficulty of your position said dumbledore why else do you think i have not confronted you before now because i knew that you would have been murdered if lord voldemort realised that i suspected you 
 
 malfoy winced at the sound of the name 
 
 i did not dare speak to you of the mission with which i knew you had been entrusted in case he used legilimency against you continued dumbledore but now at last we can speak plainly to each other no harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived i can help you draco 
 
 no you said malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed nobody can he told me to do it or kill me got no choice 
 
 come over to the right side draco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine what is more i can send members of the order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise your father is safe at the moment in azkaban when the time comes we can protect him too come over to the right side draco you are not a killer 
 
 malfoy stared at dumbledore 
 
 but i got this far i he said slowly they thought die in the attempt but here and in my power the one with the wand at my mercy 
 
 no draco said dumbledore quietly it is my mercy and not yours that matters now 
 
 malfoy did not speak his mouth was open his wand hand still trembling harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction 
 
 but suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ramparts still paralysed his eyes staring unblinkingly harry gazed in terror upon four strangers it seemed the death eaters had won the fight below 
 
 a man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle 
 
 dumbledore cornered he said and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly dumbledore wandless dumbledore alone well done draco well done 
 
 good evening amycus said dumbledore calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party and brought alecto too charming 
 
 the woman gave an angry little titter 
 
 think your little help you on your death bed then she jeered 
 
 jokes no no these are manners replied dumbledore 
 
 do it said the stranger standing nearest to harry a big rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers whose black death robes looked uncomfortably tight he had a voice like none that harry had ever heard a rasping bark of a voice harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakeably of blood coming from him his filthy hands had long yellowish nails 
 
 is that you fenrir asked dumbledore 
 
 right rasped the other pleased to see me dumbledore 
 
 no i cannot say that i am 
 
 fenrir greyback grinned showing pointed teeth blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly obscenely 
 
 but you know how much i like kids dumbledore 
 
 am i to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now this is most unusual you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month 
 
 right said greyback shocks you that does it dumbledore frightens you 
 
 well i cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little said dumbledore and yes i am a little shocked that draco here invited you of all people into the school where his friends live 
 
 i breathed malfoy he was not looking at greyback he did not seem to want to even glance at him i know he was going to come 
 
 i want to miss a trip to hogwarts dumbledore rasped greyback not when there are throats to be ripped out delicious delicious 
 
 and he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at dumbledore 
 
 i could do you for afters dumbledore 
 
 no said the fourth death eater sharply he had a heavy face got orders got to do it now draco and quickly 
 
 malfoy was showing less resolution than ever he looked terrified as he stared into face which was even paler and rather lower than usual as he had slid so far down the rampart wall 
 
 not long for this world anyway if you ask me said the lopsided man to the accompaniment of his wheezing giggles look at happened to you then dumby 
 
 oh weaker resistance slower reflexes amycus said dumbledore old age in short one day perhaps it will happen to you if you are lucky 
 
 that mean then that mean yelled the death eater suddenly violent always the same yeh dumby talking and doing nothing nothing i even know why the dark bothering to kill yeh come on draco do it 
 
 but at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted blocked the stairsreducto reducto 
 
 heart leapt so these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them 
 
 now draco quickly said the man angrily 
 
 but hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim 
 
 do it snarled greyback moving towards dumbledore with his hands outstretched his teeth bared 
 
 i said no shouted the man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furious heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by spellif he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak 
 
 draco do it or stand aside so one of us screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood snape his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene from dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four death eaters including the enraged werewolf and malfoy 
 
 got a problem snape said the lumpy amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon dumbledore the boy seem able 
 
 but somebody else had spoken name quite softly 
 
 severus 
 
 the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening for the first time dumbledore was pleading 
 
 snape said nothing but walked forwards and pushed malfoy roughly out of the way the three death eaters fell back without a word even the werewolf seemed cowed 
 
 snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face 
 
 severus please 
 
 snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 a jet of green light shot from the end of wand and hit dumbledore squarely in the chest scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he was forced to watch as dumbledore was blasted into the air for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backwards like a great rag doll over the battlements and out of sight

 there was no means of steering the dragon could not see where it was going and harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back nevertheless as they climbed higher and higher london unfurling below them like a map harrys overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible crouching low over the beasts neck he clung tight to the metallic scales and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin the dragons wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill behind him whether from delight or fear he could not tell ron kept swearing at the top of his voice and hermione seemed to be sobbing 
 
 after five minutes or so harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening he had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing nor how this particular dragon which could barely see would locate a good place to put down he glanced around constantly imagining that he could feel his seat prickling 
 
 how long would it be before voldemort knew that they had broken into the lestranges vault how soon would the goblins of gringotts notify bellatrix how quickly would they realize what had been taken and then when they discovered that the golden cup was missing voldemort would know at last that they were hunting horcruxes 
 
 the dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air it climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud and harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital on and on they flew over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon 
 
 what do you reckon its looking for ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north 
 
 no idea harry bellow back his hands were numb with cold but he did not date attempt to shift his grip he had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them if the dragon headed for open seal he was cold and numb not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty when he wondered had the beast itself last eaten surely it would need sustenance before long and what if at that point it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back 
 
 the sun slipped lower in the sky which was turning indigo and still the dragon flew cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud every part of harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragons back 
 
 is it my imagination shouted ron after a considerable stretch of silence or are we losing height 
 
 harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes coppery in the sunset the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight 
 
 lower and lower the dragon flew in great spiraling circles honing in it seemed upon one of the smaller lakes 
 
 i say we jump when it gets low enough harry called back to the others straight into the water before it realizes were here 
 
 they agreed hermione a little faintly and now harry could see the dragons wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water 
 
 now 
 
 he slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard plunging like a stone into a freezing green world he kicked toward the surface and emerged panting to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where ron and hermione had fallen the dragon did not seem to have noticed anything it was already fifty feet away swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout as ron and hermione emerged spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake the dragon flew on its wings beating hard and landed at last on a distant bank 
 
 harry ron and hermione struck out for the opposite shore the lake did not seem to be deep soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming and at last they flopped sodden panting and exhausted onto slippery grass 
 
 hermione collapsed coughing and shuddering though harry could have happily lain down and slept he staggered to his feet drew out his wand and started casting the usual protective spells around them 
 
 when he had finished he joined the others it was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms and their clothing was singed away in places they were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries hermione handed harry the bottle then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from shell cottage and clean dry robes for all of them they changes and then gulped down the juice 
 
 well on the upside said ron finally who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow we got the horcrux on the downside 
 
 c no sword said harry through gritted teeth as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath 
 
 no sword repeated ron that little scab 
 
 harry pulled the horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them glinting in the sun it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice 
 
 at least we cant wear it this time thatd look a bit weird hanging around our necks said ron wiping his mouth on the back of his hand 
 
 hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking 
 
 whatll happen to it do you think she asked will it be alright 
 
 you sound like hagrid said ron its a dragon hermione it can look after itself its us we need to worry about 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 well i dont know how to break this to you said ron but i think they might have noticed we broke into gringotts 
 
 all three of them started to laugh and once started it was difficult to stop harrys ribs ached he felt lightheaded with hunger but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw 
 
 what are we going to do though said hermione finally hiccuping herself back to seriousness hell know wont he will know we know about his horcruxes 
 
 maybe theyll be too scared to tell him said ron hopefully maybe theyll cover up c 
 
 the sky the smell of the lake water the sound of rons voice were extinguished pain cleaved harrys head like a sword stroke 
 
 
 
 
 he was standing in a dimly lit room and a semicircle of wizards faced him and on the floor at his feet knelt a small quaking figure 
 
 what did you say to me his voice was high and cold but fury and fear burned inside him the one thing that he had dreaded c but it could not be true he could not see how 
 
 the goblin was trembling unable to meet the red eyes high above his 
 
 say it again murmured voldemort say it again 
 
 lord stammered the goblin its black eyes wide with terror lord we to them my lord broke broke into the c into the lestranges vault 
 
 impostors what impostors i thought gringotts had ways of revealing impostors who were they 
 
 it was it was the and the accomplices 
 
 and they took he said his voice rising a terrible fear gripping him tell me what did they take 
 
 a a golden lord 
 
 the scream of rage of denial left him as if it were a strangers he was crazed frenzied it could not be true it was impossible nobody had known how was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret 
 
 the elder wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room the kneeling goblin rolled over dead the watching wizards scattered before him terrified bellatrix and lucius malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door and again and again his wand fell and those who were left were slain all of them for bringing him this news for hearing about the golden cup alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down and they passed before him in vision his treasures his safeguards his anchors to immortality c the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen what if what if the boy knew about the others could he know had he already acted had he traced more of them was dumbledore at the root of this dumbledore who had always suspected him dumbledore dead on his orders dumbledore whose wand was his now yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy the boy 
 
 but surely if the boy had destroyed any of his horcruxes he lord voldemort would have known would have felt it he the greatest wizard of them all he the most powerful he the killer of dumbledore and of how many other worthless nameless men how could lord voldemort not have known if he himself most important and precious had been attacked mutilated 
 
 true he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed but he had thought that was because he had no body to fell being less than ghost no surely the rest were safe the other horcruxes must be intact 
 
 but he must know he must be sure he paced the room kicking aside the goblins corpse as he passed and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain the lake the shack and hogwarts 
 
 a modicum of calm cooled his rage now how could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the gaunt shack no one had ever known him to be related to the gaunts he had hidden the connection the killings had never been traced to him the ring surely was safe 
 
 and how could the boy or anybody else know about the cave or penetrate its protection the idea of the locket being stolen was absurd 
 
 as for the school he alone knew where in hogwarts he had stowed the horcrux because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place 
 
 and there was still nagini who must remain close now no longer sent to do his bidding under his protection 
 
 but to be sure to be utterly sure he must return to each of his hiding places he must redouble protection around each of his horcruxes a job like the quest for the elder wand that he must undertake alone 
 
 which should he visit first which was in most danger an old unease flickered inside him dumbledore had known his middle name dumbledore might have made the connection with the gaunts their abandoned home was perhaps the least secure of his hiding places it was there that he would go first 
 
 the lake surely impossible though was there a slight possibility that dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds through the orphanage 
 
 and hogwarts but he knew the his horcrux there was safe it would be impossible for potter to enter hogsmeade without detection let alone the school nevertheless it would be prudent to alert snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle to tell snape why the boy might return would be foolish of course it had been a grave mistake to trust bellatrix and malfoy didnt their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust 
 
 he would visit the gaunt shack first then and take nagini with him he would not be parted from the snake anymore and he strode from the room through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain played he called the snake in parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow 
 
 
 
 
 harrys eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present he was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun and ron and hermione were looking down at him judging by their worried looks and by the continued pounding of his scar his sudden excursion into voldemorts mind had not passed unnoticed he struggled up shivering vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him and the lake deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun 
 
 he knows his own voice sounded strange and low after voldemorts high screams he knows and hes going to check where the others are and the last one he was already on his feet is at hogwarts i knew it i knew it 
 
 what 
 
 ron was gaping at him hermione sat up looking worried 
 
 but what did you see how do you know 
 
 i saw him find out about the cup i c i was in his head hes c harry remembered the killings c hes seriously angry and scared too he cant understand how we knew and now hes going to check the others are safe the ring first he things the hogwarts one is safest because snapes there because itll be so hard not to be seen getting in i think hell check that one last but he could still be there within hours c 
 
 did you see where in hogwarts it is asked ron now scrambling to his feet too 
 
 no he was concentrating on warning snape he didnt think about exactly where it is c 
 
 wait wait cried hermione as ron caught up to the horcrux and harry pulled out the invisibility cloak again we cant just go we havent got a plan we need to c 
 
 we need to get going said harry firmly he had been hoping to sleep looking forward to getting into the new tent but that was impossible now can you imagine what hes going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone what if he moves the hogwarts horcrux decides it isnt safe enough 
 
 but how are we going to get in 
 
 well go to hogsmeade said harry and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the schools like get under the cloak hermione i want to stick together this time 
 
 but we dont really fit c 
 
 itll be dark no ones going to notice our feet 
 
 the flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water the dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air they paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher now black against the rapidly darkening sky until it vanished over a nearby mountain then hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two harry pulled the cloak down as far as it would go and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 poultry family 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 poultry meg was the only person who lived in the new stately 
 dwelling that had been built for the fowls and ducks belonging to 
 the manor house it stood there where once the old knightly building 
 had stood with its tower its pointed gables its moat and its 
 drawbridge close by it was a wilderness of trees and thicket here 
 the garden had been and had stretched out to a great lake which 
 was now moorland crows and choughs flew screaming over the old trees and there were crowds of birds they did not seem to get fewer when any one shot among them but seemed rather to increase one heard the screaming into the where poultry meg sat with the ducklings running to and fro over her wooden shoes she knew every fowl and every duck from the moment it crept out of the shell and she was fond of her fowls and her ducks and proud of the stately house that had been built for them her own little room in the house was clean and neat for that was the wish of the gracious lady to whom the house belonged she often came in the company of grand noble guests to whom she showed the hens and ducks barracks as she called the little house 
 
 here were a clothes cupboard and an and even a 
 chest of drawers and on these drawers a polished metal plate had been placed whereon was engraved the word grubbe and this was the name of the noble family that had lived in the house of old the brass plate had been found when they were digging the foundation and the clerk has said it had no value except in being an old relic the clerk knew all about the place and about the old times for he had his 
 knowledge from books and many a memorandum had been written and put in his but the oldest of the crows perhaps knew more than he and screamed it out in her own language but that was the language and the clerk did not understand that clever as he was 
 
 after the hot summer days the mist sometimes hung over the 
 moorland as if a whole lake were behind the old trees among which the crows and the daws were fluttering and thus it had looked when the good knight grubbe had lived here when the old manor house stood with its thick red walls the used to reach in those days quite over the gateway through the tower one went into a paved passage which led to the rooms the windows were narrow and the panes were small even in the great hall where the dancing used to be but in the time of the last grubbe there had been no dancing in the hall within the memory of man although an old drum still lay there that had served as part of the music here stood a quaintly carved 
 cupboard in which rare were kept for my lady grubbe was fond of plants and cultivated trees and shrubs her husband 
 preferred riding out to shoot wolves and boars and his little 
 daughter marie always went with him part of the way when she was only five years old she would sit proudly on her horse and look saucily round with her great black eyes it was a great amusement to her to hit out among the with her whip but her father would rather have seen her hit among the peasant boys who came running up to stare at their lord 
 
 the peasant in the clay hut close by the knightly house had a 
 son named soren of the same age as the gracious little lady the 
 boy could climb well and had always to bring her down the 
 nests the birds screamed as loud as they could and one of the 
 greatest of them hacked him with its beak over the eye so that the 
 blood ran down and it was at first thought the eye had been 
 destroyed but it had not been injured after all marie grubbe used to 
 call him her soren and that was a great favor and was an advantage 
 to father poor jon who had one day committed a fault and 
 was to be punished by riding on the wooden horse this same horse 
 stood in the courtyard and had four poles for legs and a single 
 narrow plant for a back on this jon had to ride astride and some 
 heavy bricks were fastened to his feet into the bargain that he might 
 not sit too comfortably he made horrible grimaces and soren wept and implored little marie to interfere she immediately ordered that 
 father should be taken down and when they did not obey her she stamped on the floor and pulled at her sleeve till it 
 was torn to pieces she would have her way and she got her way and father was taken down 
 
 lady grubbe who now came up parted her little hair 
 from the brow and looked at her affectionately but marie did 
 not understand why 
 
 she wanted to go to the hounds and not to her mother who went 
 down into the garden to the lake where the bloomed and 
 the heads of bulrushes nodded amid the reeds and she looked at all 
 this beauty and freshness how pleasant she said in the garden 
 stood at that time a rare tree which she herself had planted it 
 was called the a kind of negro growing among the other 
 trees so dark brown were the leaves this tree required much 
 sunshine for in continual shade it would become bright green like the 
 other trees and thus lose its distinctive character in the lofty 
 chestnut trees were many birds nests and also in the thickets and in 
 the grassy meadows it seemed as though the birds knew that they 
 were protected here and that no one must fire a gun at them 
 
 little marie came here with soren he knew how to climb as we 
 have already said and eggs and young birds were 
 brought down the birds great and small flew about in terror and 
 tribulation the peewit from the fields and the crows and daws from 
 the high trees screamed and screamed it was just such din as the 
 family will raise to the present day 
 
 what are you doing you children cried the gentle lady that 
 is sinful 
 
 soren stood abashed and even the little gracious lady looked down 
 a little but then he said quite short and pretty 
 
 my father lets me do it 
 
 from here cried the great black birds and 
 they flew away but on the following day they came back for they were at home here 
 
 the quiet gentle lady did not remain long at home here on earth 
 for the good god called her away and indeed her home was rather 
 with him than in the knightly house and the church bells tolled 
 solemnly when her corpse was carried to the church and the eyes of 
 the poor people were wet with tears for she had been good to them 
 when she was gone no one attended to her plantations and the 
 garden ran to waste grubbe the knight was a hard man they said 
 but his daughter young as she was knew how to manage him he used to laugh and let her have her way she was now twelve years old and strongly built she looked the people through and through with her black eyes rode her horse as bravely as a man and could fire off her gun like a practiced hunter 
 
 one day there were great visitors in the neighborhood the 
 grandest visitors who could come the young king and his and comrade the lord ulric frederick gyldenlowe they wanted to hunt the wild boar and to pass a few days at the castle of grubbe 
 
 gyldenlowe sat at table next to marie grubbe and he took her by 
 the hand and gave her a kiss as if she had been a relation but she 
 gave him a box on the ear and told him she could not bear him at 
 which there was great laughter as if that had been a very amusing 
 thing 
 
 and perhaps it was very amusing for five years afterwards 
 when marie had fulfilled her seventeenth year a messenger arrived 
 with a letter in which lord gyldenlowe proposed for the hand of the 
 noble young lady there was a thing for you 
 
 he is the grandest and most gallant gentleman in the whole 
 country said grubbe the knight that is not a thing to despise 
 
 i care so very much about him said marie grubbe but 
 she did not despise the grandest man of all the country who sat by 
 the side 
 
 silver plate and fine linen and woollen went off to copenhagen 
 in a ship while the bride made the journey by land in ten days but 
 the outfit met with contrary winds or with no winds at all for 
 four months passed before it arrived and when it came my lady 
 gyldenlowe was gone 
 
 rather lie on coarse sacking than lie in his silken beds 
 she declared rather walk barefoot than drive with him in a 
 coach 
 
 late one evening in november two women came riding into the town 
 of aarhuus they were the gracious lady gyldenlowe marie grubbe and her maid they came from the town of weile whither they had come in a ship from copenhagen they stopped at lord stone mansion in aarhuus grubbe was not well pleased with this visit marie was accosted in hard words but she had a bedroom given her and got her beer soup of a morning but the evil part of her nature was aroused against her and she was not used to that she was not of a gentle temper and we often answer as we are addressed she answered openly and spoke with bitterness and hatred of her husband with whom she declared she would not live she was too honorable for that 
 
 a year went by but it did not go by pleasantly there were evil 
 words between the father and the daughter and that ought never to be 
 
 bad words bear bad fruit what could be the end of such a state of 
 things 
 
 we two cannot live under the same roof said the father one day 
 
 go away from here to our old manor house but you had better bite 
 your tongue off than spread any lies among the people 
 
 and so the two parted she went with her maid to the old castle 
 where she had been born and near which the gentle pious lady her 
 mother was lying in the church vault an old cowherd lived in the 
 courtyard and was the only other inhabitant of the place in the 
 rooms heavy black cobwebs hung down covered with dust in the 
 garden everything grew just as it would hops and climbing plants 
 ran like a net between the trees and bushes and the hemlock and 
 nettle grew larger and stronger the had been outgrown 
 by other trees and now stood in the shade and its leaves were 
 green like those of the common trees and its glory had departed 
 crows and choughs in great close masses flew past over the tall 
 chestnut trees and chattered and screamed as if they had something 
 very important to tell one another as if they were saying now 
 come back again the little girl who had their eggs and their young 
 ones stolen from them and as for the thief who had got them down 
 he had to climb up a leafless tree for he sat on a tall 
 mast and was beaten with a end if he did not behave himself 
 
 the clerk told all this in our own times he had collected it and looked it up in books and memoranda it was to be found with many other writings locked up in his 
 
 upward and downward is the course of the world said he it 
 is strange to hear 
 
 and we will hear how it went with marie grubbe we need not for 
 that forget poultry meg who is sitting in her capital in 
 our own time marie grubbe sat down in her times but not with the 
 same spirit that old poultry meg showed 
 
 the winter passed away and the spring and the summer passed away and the autumn came again with the damp cold it was a lonely desolate life in the old manor house marie grubbe took her gun in her hand and went out to the heath and shot hares and foxes and whatever birds she could hit more than once she met the noble sir palle dyre of norrebak who was also wandering about with his gun and his dogs he was tall and strong and boasted of this when they talked together he could have measured himself against the deceased mr brockenhuus of egeskov of whom the people still talked palle dyre had after the example of brockenhuus caused an iron chain with a to be hung in his gateway and when he came riding home he used to seize the chain and lift himself and his horse from the ground and blow the horn 
 
 come yourself and see me do that dame marie he said one can breathe fresh and free at norrebak 
 
 when she went to his castle is not known but on the altar 
 candlestick in the church of norrebak it was inscribed that they 
 were the gift of palle dyre and marie grubbe of norrebak castle 
 a great stout man was palle dyre he drank like a sponge he was 
 like a tub that could never get full he snored like a whole sty of 
 pigs and he looked red and bloated 
 
 he is treacherous and malicious said dame pally dyre 
 daughter soon she was weary of her life with him but that 
 did not make it better 
 
 one day the table was spread and the dishes grew cold palle dyre 
 was out hunting foxes and the gracious lady was nowhere to be 
 found towards midnight palle dyre came home but dame dyre came neither at midnight nor next morning she had turned her back upon norrebak and had ridden away without saying 
 
 it was gray wet weather the wind grew cold and a flight of 
 black screaming birds flew over her head they were not so homeless as she 
 
 first she journeyed southward quite down into the german land 
 a couple of golden rings with costly stones were turned into money 
 and then she turned to the east and then she turned again and went 
 towards the west she had no food before her eyes and murmured 
 against everything even against the good god himself so wretched was her soul soon her body became wretched too and she was scarcely able to move a foot the peewit flew up as she stumbled over the mound of earth where it had built its nest the bird cried as it always cried you thief you thief she had never stolen her goods but as a little girl she had caused eggs and young birds to be taken from the trees and she thought of that now 
 
 from where she lay she could see the by the seashore 
 lived fishermen but she could not get so far she was so ill the 
 great white flew over her head and screamed as the crows and daws screamed at home in the garden of the manor house the birds flew quite close to her and at last it seemed to her as if they became black as crows and then all was night before her eyes 
 
 when she opened her eyes again she was being lifted and 
 carried a great strong man had taken her up in his arms and she 
 was looking straight into his bearded face he had a scar over one 
 eye which seemed to divide the eyebrow into two parts weak as she 
 was he carried her to the ship where he got a rating for it from the 
 captain 
 
 the next day the ship sailed away madame grubbe had not been 
 put ashore so she sailed away with it but she will return will 
 she not yes but where and when 
 
 the clerk could tell about this too and it was not a story 
 which he patched together himself he had the whole strange history 
 out of an old authentic book which we ourselves can take out and 
 read the danish historian ludwig holberg who has written so many useful books and merry comedies from which we can get such a good idea of his times and their people tells in his letters of marie 
 grubbe where and how he met her it is well worth hearing but for 
 all that we at all forget poultry meg who is sitting 
 cheerful and comfortable in the charming 
 
 the ship sailed away with marie grubbe where we left off 
 long years went by 
 
 the plague was raging at copenhagen it was in the year 
 the queen of denmark went away to her german home the king quitted the capital and everybody who could do so hurried away 
 the students even those who had board and lodging gratis left the city one of these students the last who had remained in the free college at last went away too it was two in the morning he was carrying his knapsack which was better stacked with books and writings than with clothes a damp mist hung over the town not a person was to be seen in the streets the around were marked with crosses as a sign that the plague was within or that all the inmates were dead a great wagon rattled past him the coachman brandished his whip and the horses flew by at a gallop the wagon was filled with corpses the young student kept his hand before his face and smelt at some strong spirits that he had with him on a sponge in a little brass out of a small tavern in one of the streets there were sounds of singing and of unhallowed laughter from people who drank the night through to forget that the plague was at their doors and that they might be put into the wagon as the others had been the student turned his steps towards the canal at the castle bridge where a couple of small ships were lying one of these was weighing anchor to get away from the city 
 
 if god spares our lives and grants us a fair wind we are going 
 to gronmud near falster said the captain and he asked the name 
 of the student who wished to go with him 
 
 ludwig holberg answered the student and the name sounded 
 like any other but now there sounds in it one of the proudest names 
 of denmark then it was the name of a young unknown student 
 the ship glided past the castle it was not yet bright day when it 
 was in the open sea a light wind filled the sails and the young 
 student sat down with his face turned towards the fresh wind and went to sleep which was not exactly the most prudent thing he could have done 
 
 already on the third day the ship lay by the island of falster 
 
 do you know any one here with whom i could lodge cheaply 
 holberg asked the captain 
 
 i should think you would do well to go to the in 
 borrehaus answered the captain if you want to be very civil to 
 her her name is mother soren sorensen muller but it may happen 
 that she may fly into a fury if you are too polite to her the man 
 is in custody for a crime and why she manages the 
 herself she has fists of her own 
 
 the student took his knapsack and betook himself to the 
 the house door was not locked it opened and he went 
 into a room with a brick floor where a bench with a great coverlet 
 of leather formed the chief article of furniture a white hen who 
 had a brood of chickens was fastened to the bench and had overturned the pipkin of water so that the wet ran across the floor 
 there were no people either here or in the adjoining room only a cradle stood there in which was a child the came back with only one person in it whether that person was a man or a woman was not an easy matter to determine the person in question was wrapped in a great cloak and wore a kind of hood presently the boat lay to 
 
 it was a woman who got out of it and came into the room she 
 looked very stately when she straightened her back two proud eyes 
 looked forth from beneath her black eyebrows it was mother soren the the crows and daws might have called out another name for her which we know better 
 
 she looked morose and did not seem to care to talk but this much 
 was settled that the student should board in her house for an 
 indefinite time while things looked so bad in copenhagen 
 
 this or that honest citizen would often come to the 
 from the neighboring little town there came frank the cutler and 
 sivert the exciseman they drank a mug of beer in the and used to converse with the student for he was a clever young man who knew his practica as they called it he could read greek and latin and was well up in learned subjects 
 
 the less one knows the less it presses upon one said mother 
 soren 
 
 you have to work hard said holberg one day when she was 
 dipping clothes in the strong soapy water and was obliged herself 
 to split the logs for the fire 
 
 my affair she replied 
 
 have you been obliged to toil in this way from your childhood 
 you can read that from my hands she replied and held out her 
 hands that were small indeed but hard and strong with bitten nails 
 you are learned and can read 
 
 at it began to snow heavily the cold came on 
 the wind blue sharp as if there were vitriol in it to wash the 
 faces mother soren did not let that disturb her she threw 
 her cloak around her and drew her hood over her head early in the 
 afternoon it was already dark in the house she laid wood and turf on 
 the hearth and then she sat down to darn her stockings for there was 
 no one to do it for her towards evening she spoke more words to the student than it was customary with her to use she spoke of her 
 husband 
 
 he killed a sailor of dragor by mischance and for that he has to 
 work for three years in irons only a common sailor and 
 therefore the law must take its course 
 
 the law is there for people of high rank too said holberg 
 do you think so said mother soren then she looked into the 
 fire for a while but after a time she began to speak again have you 
 heard of kai lykke who caused a church to be pulled down and when the clergyman master martin thundered from the pulpit about it he had him put in irons and sat in judgment upon him and condemned him to death yes and the clergyman was obliged to bow his head to the stroke and yet kai lykke went 
 
 he had a right to do as he did in those times said holberg 
 
 but now we have left those times behind us 
 
 you may get a fool to believe that cried mother soren and 
 she got up and went into the room where the child lay she lifted up 
 the child and laid it down more comfortably then she arranged the 
 of the student he had the green coverlet for he felt the 
 cold more than she though he was born in norway 
 
 on new morning it was a bright sunshiny day the frost 
 had been so strong and was still so strong that the fallen snow 
 had become a hard mass and one could walk upon it the bells of the little town were tolling for church student holberg wrapped himself up in his woollen cloak and wanted to go to the town 
 
 over the the crows and daws were flying with loud 
 cries one could hardly hear the church bells for their screaming 
 mother soren stood in front of the house filling a brass pot with 
 snow which she was going to put on the fire to get drinking water 
 she looked up to the crowd of birds and thought her own thoughts 
 student holberg went to church on his way there and on his return 
 he passed by the house of sivert by the here 
 he was invited to take a mug of brown beer with treacle and sugar 
 the discourse fell upon mother soren but the tax collector did not know much about her and indeed few knew much about her she did not belong to the island of falster he said she had a little property of her own at one time her husband was a common sailor a fellow of a very hot temper and had killed a sailor of dragor and he beat his wife and yet she defended him 
 
 i should not endure such treatment said the 
 wife i am come of more respectable people my father was 
 to the court 
 
 and consequently you have married a governmental official 
 said holberg and made a bow to her and to the collector 
 it was on twelfth night the evening of the festival of the 
 three kings mother soren lit up for holberg a candle that 
 is a tallow candle with three wicks which she had herself prepared 
 
 a light for each man said holberg 
 
 for each man repeated the woman looking sharply at him 
 
 for each of the wise men from the east said holberg 
 
 you mean it that way said she and then she was silent for a 
 long time but on this evening he learned more about her than he had 
 yet known 
 
 you speak very affectionately of your husband observed holberg 
 
 and yet the people say that he you every day 
 
 no business but mine she replied the blows might 
 have done me good when i was a child now i suppose i get them for my sins but i know what good he has done me and she rose up when i lay sick upon the desolate heath and no one would have pity on me and no one would have anything to do with me except the crows and daws which came to peck me to bits he carried me in his arms and had to bear hard words because of the burden he brought on board ship not in my nature to be sick and so i got well every man has his own way and soren has his but the horse must not be judged by the halter taking one thing with another i have lived more agreeably with him than with the man whom they called the most noble and gallant of the subjects i have had the stadtholder gyldenlowe the for my husband and afterwards i took palle dyre one is as good as another each in his own way and i in mine that was a long gossip but now you know all about me 
 
 and with those words she left the room 
 it was marie grubbe so strangely had fate played with her she 
 did not live to see many anniversaries of the festival of the three 
 kings holberg has recorded that she died in june but he has 
 not written down for he did not know that a number of great black 
 birds circled over the when mother soren as she was 
 called was lying there a corpse they did not scream as if they knew 
 that at a burial silence should be observed so soon as she lay in the 
 earth the birds disappeared but on the same evening in jutland at 
 the old manor house an enormous number of crows and choughs were seen they all cried as loud as they could as if they had some 
 announcement to make perhaps they talked of him who as a little boy had taken away their eggs and their young of the son who had to wear an iron garter and of the noble young lady who ended by being a wife 
 
 brave brave they cried 
 
 and the whole family cried brave brave when the old house was 
 pulled down 
 
 they are still crying and yet nothing to cry about 
 said the clerk when he told the story the family is extinct the 
 house has been pulled down and where it stood is now the stately 
 with gilded weathercocks and the old poultry meg 
 she rejoices greatly in her beautiful dwelling if she had not come 
 here the old clerk added she would have had to go into the 
 
 
 the pigeons cooed over her the gobbled and the 
 ducks quacked 
 
 nobody knew her they said she belongs to no family pure 
 charity that she is here at all she has neither a drake father nor 
 a hen mother and has no descendants 
 
 she came of a great family for all that but she did not know it 
 and the old clerk did not know it though he had so much written down but one of the old crows knew about it and told about it she had heard from her own mother and grandmother about poultry mother and grandmother and we know the grandmother too we saw her ride as child over the bridge looking proudly around her as if the whole world belonged to her and all the birds nests in it and we saw her on the heath by the and last of all in the the granddaughter the last of her race had come back to the old home where the old castle had stood where the black wild birds were screaming but she sat among the tame birds and these knew her and were fond of her poultry meg had nothing left to wish for she looked forward with pleasure to her death and she was old enough to die 
 
 grave grave cried the crows 
 
 and poultry meg has a good grave which nobody knew except the old crow if the old crow is not dead already 
 
 and now we know the story of the old manor house of its old 
 proprietors and of all poultry family

 recruits 
 the band augmented every moment 
 near the rue des billettes a man of lofty stature whose hair was turning gray and whose bold and daring mien was remarked by courfeyrac enjolras and combeferre but whom none of them knew joined them 
 gavroche who was occupied in singing whistling humming running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol paid no attention to this man 
 it chanced that in the rue de la verrerie they passed in front of door 
 this happens just right said courfeyrac i have forgotten my purse and i have lost my hat 
 he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed he seized an old hat and his purse 
 he also seized a large square coffer of the dimensions of a large valise which was concealed under his soiled linen 
 as he descended again at a run the portress hailed him 
 monsieur de courfeyrac 
 your name portress 
 the portress stood bewildered 
 why you know perfectly well the concierge my name is mother veuvain 
 well if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again i shall call you mother de veuvain 
 now speak the matter 
 what do you want 
 there is some one who wants to speak with you 
 who is it 
 i know 
 where is he 
 in my lodge 
 the devil ejaculated courfeyrac 
 but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the portress 
 at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckled and youthful artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a voice 
 monsieur marius if you please 
 he is not here 
 will he return this evening 
 i know nothing about it 
 and courfeyrac added 
 for my part i shall not return 
 the young man gazed steadily at him and said 
 why not 
 because 
 where are you going then 
 what business is that of yours 
 would you like to have me carry your coffer for you 
 i am going to the barricades 
 would you like to have me go with you 
 if you like replied courfeyrac 
 the street is free the pavements belong to every one 
 and he made his escape at a run to join his friends 
 when he had rejoined them he gave the coffer to one of them to carry it was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had actually followed them 
 a mob does not go precisely where it intends 
 we have explained that a gust of wind carries it away 
 they overshot and found themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue

 mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but the desire to find those causes is implanted in soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says this is the cause in historical events where the actions of men are the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will of those who stood in the most prominent position the heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these laws is only possible when possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth 
 the historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the most important episode of the war of was the movement of the russian army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino camp the flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and following them others consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in was on the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or followed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it 
 that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained inactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what would have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous 
 the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in reality like the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety but resulted moment by moment step by step event by event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past 
 at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a direct retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all there is the conversation after the council between the commander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariat department lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river oka which cannot be crossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a direct retreat on the army turned more to the south along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the in activity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula road having crossed over by a forced march to the tula road beyond the pakhra the russian commanders intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects of giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino which was between the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say precisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varying forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result

 history of corinthe from its foundation 
 the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue rambuteau at the end near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue mondetour a shop having for its sign a basket in the form of napoleon the great with this inscription 
 napoleon is made wholly of willow 
 have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago 
 it was there that lay the rue de la chanvrerie which ancient deeds spell chanverrerie and the celebrated called corinthe 
 the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about to shed a little light 
 may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of waterloo 
 persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the pointe at the northeast angle of the halles of paris where lies the embouchure of the rue rambuteau have only to imagine an n touching the rue with its summit and the halles with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la and the rue de la chanvrerie and whose transverse bar should be formed by the rue de la the old rue mondetour cut the three strokes of the n at the most crooked angles so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue des precheurs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of varying sizes placed crosswise and and barely separated like the blocks of stone in a dock by narrow crannies 
 we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark contracted alleys lined with buildings these buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chanvrerie and the rue de la the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house to another 
 the street was narrow and the gutter broad the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet skirting little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous gratings 
 the rue rambuteau has devastated all that 
 the name of mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that whole set of streets 
 a little further on they are found still better expressed by the rue pirouette which ran into the rue mondetour 
 the who got entangled from the rue in the rue de la chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel 
 at the end of this street which was very short he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape 
 this was the rue mondetour which on one side ran into the rue de precheurs and on the other into the rue du cygne and the at the bottom of this sort of at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a sort of cape in the street it is in this house of two stories only that an illustrious had been merrily installed three hundred years before this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old theophilus described in the following couplet la branle le squelette horrible 
 pauvre amant qui se pendit 
 there swings the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself 
 the situation was good and succeeded each other there from father to son 
 in the time of mathurin regnier this cabaret was called the and as the rebus was then in fashion it had for its a post poteau painted in the last century the worthy natoire one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school having got drunk many times in this at the very table where regnier had drunk his fill had painted by way of gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes on the pink post the keeper of the cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth grapes au raisin de corinthe hence the name of corinthe 
 nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses the ellipsis is the of the phrase 
 corinthe gradually dethroned the the last proprietor of the dynasty father hucheloup no longer acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue 
 a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first floor containing a a wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad was the style of this cabaret a staircase with a in the lower room led to the cellar on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor 
 under the roof in two mansard attics were the nests for the servants 
 the kitchen shared the with the 
 father hucheloup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his they also ate there 
 hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps which he called carpes au gras 
 these were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of louis xvi on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of people came thither from a distance 
 hucheloup one fine morning had seen fit to notify of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint and as he was an orthographer on his own account as well as a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription 
 carpes ho gras 
 one winter the and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word and the g which began the third this is what ho ras 
 time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice 
 in this way it came about that though he knew no french father hucheloup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled horace and the striking thing about it was that that also meant enter my 
 nothing of all this is in existence now 
 the mondetour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in and probably no longer exists at the present moment 
 the rue de la chanvrerie and corinthe have disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue rambuteau 
 as we have already said corinthe was the if not the of courfeyrac and his friends 
 it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe 
 he had entered it on account of the carpe horas and had returned thither on account of the carpes au gras 
 there they drank there they ate there they shouted they did not pay much they paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome 
 father hucheloup was a jovial host 
 hucheloup that amiable man as was just said was a with a mustache an amusing variety 
 he always had an air seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who entered his establishment and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup 
 and yet we insist upon the word people were always welcome there 
 this oddity had attracted customers to his shop and brought him young men who said to each other 
 come hear father hucheloup growl 
 he had been a all of a sudden he would burst out laughing a big voice a good fellow 
 he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked nothing better than to frighten you very much like those which are in the shape of a pistol the detonation makes one sneeze 
 mother hucheloup his wife was a bearded and a very homely creature 
 about father hucheloup died 
 with him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps 
 his inconsolable widow continued to keep the but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had always been bad became fearfully bad nevertheless courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to corinthe out of pity as bossuet said 
 the widow hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic recollections 
 she deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation 
 she had a way of her own of saying things which spiced her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime it had formerly been her delight so she affirmed to hear the chanter dans les ogrepines hear the redbreasts sing in the 
 the hall on the first floor where the restaurant was situated was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and tables and with a crippled lame old it was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship 
 this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was always burning had the air of a garret 
 all the furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mame etonne a dix pas elle epouvente a deux 
 une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux 
 on tremble a chaque instant ne vous la mouche 
 et beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche 
 she astounds at ten paces she frightens at two a wart inhabits her hazardous nose you tremble every instant lest she should blow it at you and lest some fine day her nose should tumble into her mouth 
 this was scrawled in charcoal on the wall 
 mame hucheloup a good likeness went and came from morning till night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity two named matelote and gibelotte and who had never been known by any other names helped mame hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls matelote large plump redhaired and noisy the favorite of the defunct hucheloup was homelier than any mythological monster be it what it may still as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was less homely than mame hucheloup 
 gibelotte tall delicate white with a lymphatic pallor with circles round her eyes and drooping lids always languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude the first up in the house and the last in bed waited on every one even the other maid silently and gently smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile 
 matelote 
 a culinary preparation of various fishes gibelotte 
 stewed rabbits 
 before entering the restaurant room the visitor read on the door the following line written there in chalk by si tu peux et mange si tu 
 treat if you can and eat if you dare

 the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of the french had ceased the russian army which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct course and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant 
 if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest 
 that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road and the letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kaluga 
 having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodino the russian army when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received assumed the position natural to it 
 merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is called but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the french inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle of borodino had been a victory he alone who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless engagements 
 the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and merely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard to moan 
 the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to camp with overtures for peace 
 napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him though they were meaningless 
 monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur le prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection 
 napoleon 
 moscow october 
 kutuzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of my nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking 
 during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were mission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow of recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight of was doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial change in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres

 preliminary gayeties 
 laigle de meaux as the reader knows lived more with joly than elsewhere 
 he had a lodging as a bird has one on a branch the two friends lived together ate together slept together they had everything in common even musichetta to some extent they were what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bini 
 on the morning of the th of june they went to corinthe to breakfast 
 joly who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which laigle was beginning to share 
 coat was threadbare but joly was well dressed 
 it was about nine in the morning when they opened the door of corinthe 
 they ascended to the first floor 
 matelote and gibelotte received them 
 oysters cheese and ham said laigle 
 and they seated themselves at a table 
 the was empty there was no one there but themselves 
 gibelotte knowing joly and laigle set a bottle of wine on the table 
 while they were busy with their first oysters a head appeared at the hatchway of the staircase and a voice said 
 i am passing by 
 i smell from the street a delicious odor of brie cheese 
 i enter 
 it was grantaire 
 grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table 
 at the sight of grantaire gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the table 
 that made three 
 are you going to drink those two bottles 
 laigle inquired of grantaire 
 grantaire replied 
 all are ingenious thou alone art ingenuous 
 two bottles never yet astonished a man 
 the others had begun by eating grantaire began by drinking half a bottle was rapidly gulped down 
 so you have a hole in your stomach began laigle again 
 you have one in your elbow said grantaire 
 and after having emptied his glass he added 
 ah by the way laigle of the funeral oration your coat is old 
 i should hope so retorted laigle 
 why we get on well together my coat and i it has acquired all my folds it does not bind me anywhere it is moulded on my deformities it falls in with all my movements i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm 
 old coats are just like old friends 
 true ejaculated joly striking into the dialogue an old goat is an old abi ami friend 
 especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said grantaire 
 grantaire demanded laigle have you just come from the boulevard 
 no 
 we have just seen the head of the procession pass joly and i 
 a marvellous sight said joly 
 how quiet this street is exclaimed laigle 
 who would suspect that paris was turned upside down 
 how plainly it is to be seen that in former days there were nothing but convents here in this neighborhood 
 du breul and sauval give a list of them and so does the abbe lebeuf 
 they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minims capuchins carmelites little augustines great augustines old was no end of them 
 talk of monks interrupted grantaire it makes one want to scratch self 
 then he exclaimed 
 bouh 
 just swallowed a bad oyster 
 now hypochondria is taking possession of me again 
 the oysters are spoiled the servants are ugly i hate the human race 
 i just passed through the rue richelieu in front of the big public library 
 that pile of which is called a library is disgusting even to think of 
 what paper what ink 
 what scrawling 
 and all that has been written 
 what rascal was it who said that man was a featherless biped and then i met a pretty girl of my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called floreal and who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with deigned to take a fancy to her alas woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well as birds 
 two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she adjusted little brass rings in the of corsets what do you call it 
 she sewed she had a camp bed she dwelt beside a pot of flowers she was contented now here she is a bankeress 
 this transformation took place last night i met the victim this morning in high spirits 
 the hideous point about it is that the jade is as pretty as she was yesterday her financier did not show in her face 
 roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible 
 ah there is no morality on earth i call to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel the symbol of air the olive that ninny the symbol of peace the which came nearest rangling adam with its pips and the the grandfather of petticoats 
 as for right do you know what right is 
 the gauls covet clusium rome protects clusium and demands what wrong clusium has done to them 
 brennus answers the wrong that alba did to you the wrong that fidenae did to you the wrong that the eques the volsci and the sabines have done to you 
 they were your neighbors 
 the clusians are ours we understand neighborliness just as you do 
 you have stolen alba we shall take clusium 
 rome said 
 you shall not take clusium brennus took rome 
 then he cried 
 vae victis 
 that is what right is ah what beasts of prey there are in this world 
 what eagles it makes my flesh creep 
 bipede sans plume 
 biped without 
 he held out his glass to joly who filled it then he drank and went on having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one not even himself had taken any notice 
 brennus who takes rome is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette is an eagle 
 there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other 
 so we believe in nothing 
 there is but one reality 
 drink 
 whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glaris it matters little drink 
 you talk to me of the boulevard of that procession et caetera et caetera come now is there going to be another revolution 
 this poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me 
 he has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment 
 there is a hitch it work 
 quick a revolution 
 the good god has his hands perpetually black with that if i were in his place be perfectly simple about it i would not wind up my mechanism every minute lead the human race in a straightforward way weave matters mesh by mesh without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements i would have no extraordinary repertory 
 what the rest of you call progress advances by means of two motors men and events 
 but sad to say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary 
 the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men 
 among men geniuses are required among events revolutions 
 great accidents are the law the order of things cannot do without them and judging from the apparition of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance 
 at the moment when one expects it the least god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament some queer star turns up underlined by an enormous tail and that causes the death of caesar 
 brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god a blow with a comet 
 crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold a great man in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of at the head of the poster 
 ah what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes 
 boum 
 boum extraordinary show raise your eyes boobies 
 everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama 
 good god it is too much and not enough these resources gathered from exception seem magnificence and poverty my friends providence has come down to expedients 
 what does a revolution prove 
 that god is in a quandry 
 he effects a coup because he god has not been able to make both ends meet in fact this confirms me in my conjectures as to fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness the prince de conde hung when i see winter which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the frost that paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich the appearance exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up he gives a revolution as a tradesman whose is empty gives a ball 
 god must not be judged from appearances beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a universe creation is bankrupt 
 that is why i am discontented 
 here it is the th of june it is almost night ever since this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come and i bet that it come all day 
 this is the inexactness of an clerk 
 yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition everything goes awry the universe is a tease like children those who want them have none and those who want them have them 
 total 
 vexed 
 besides laigle de meaux that offends my sight 
 it humiliates me to think that i am of the same age as that baldy 
 however i criticise but i do not insult 
 the universe is what it is 
 i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience 
 receive eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration 
 ah by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a shuttlecock between two battledores from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers 
 i was made to be a turk watching oriental houris all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man or a beauceron peasant or a venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman or a petty german prince furnishing the half of a to the germanic confederation and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to say his frontier those are the positions for which i was born 
 yes i have said a turk and i will not retract 
 i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part mohammed had his good points respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques 
 let us not insult mohammedanism the only religion which is ornamented with a now i insist on a drink the earth is a great piece of stupidity 
 and it appears that they are going to fight all those imbeciles and to break each profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of hay in the meadows really people do commit altogether too many follies 
 an old broken lantern which i have just seen at a suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten the human race yes behold me sad again 
 what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way 
 i am growing melancholy once more 
 oh frightful old world 
 people strive turn each other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it 
 and grantaire after this fit of eloquence had a fit of coughing which was well earned 
 a propos of revolution said joly it is decidedly abberent that barius is in lub 
 does any one know with whom demanded laigle 
 do 
 no 
 do 
 i tell you 
 marius love affairs exclaimed grantaire 
 i can imagine it marius is a fog and he must have found a vapor 
 marius is of the race of poets 
 he who says poet says fool madman tymbraeus apollo marius and his marie or his marion or his maria or his mariette they must make a queer pair of lovers 
 i know just what it is like ecstasies in which they forget to kiss 
 pure on earth but joined in heaven 
 they are souls possessed of senses 
 they lie among the stars 
 grantaire was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second harangue when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs 
 it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small yellow with an odd phiz a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain and wearing a contented air 
 the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed himself to laigle de meaux 
 are you monsieur bossuet 
 that is my nickname replied laigle 
 what do you want with me 
 this 
 a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me do you know mother hucheloup 
 i said 
 yes rue chanvrerie the old widow he said to me 
 go there 
 there you will find m bossuet 
 tell him from me 
 a b c a joke that playing on you it 
 he gave me ten sous 
 joly lend me ten sous said laigle and turning to grantaire grantaire lend me ten sous 
 this made twenty sous which laigle handed to the lad 
 thank you sir said the urchin 
 what is your name inquired laigle 
 navet friend 
 stay with us said laigle 
 breakfast with us said grantaire 
 the child replied 
 i i belong in the procession the one to shout down with polignac 
 and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the most respectful of all possible salutes he took his departure 
 the child gone grantaire took the word 
 that is the gamin 
 there are a great many varieties of the gamin species 
 the gamin is called the gamin is called a scullion the gamin is called a mitron the gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the the gamin is called the the gamin is called the gamin is called an the courtesan gamin is called the minion the kingly gamin is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino 
 in the meantime laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud 
 a b c that is to say 
 the burial of lamarque 
 the tall blonde remarked grantaire is enjolras who is sending you a warning 
 shall we go ejaculated bossuet 
 raiding said joly 
 i have sworn to go through fire but not through water 
 i wand to ged a gold 
 i shall stay here said grantaire 
 i prefer a breakfast to a hearse 
 conclusion 
 we remain said laigle 
 well then let us drink besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot 
 ah the riot i am with you cried joly 
 laigle rubbed his hands 
 now going to touch up the revolution of 
 as a matter of fact it does hurt the people along the seams 
 i think much of your revolution said grantaire 
 i execrate this government 
 it is the crown tempered by the cotton it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella 
 in fact i think that with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven 
 the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight 
 there was no one in the or in the street every one having gone off to watch events 
 is it or midnight cried bossuet 
 you see your hand before your face 
 gibelotte fetch a light 
 grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way 
 enjolras disdains me he muttered 
 enjolras said 
 joly is ill grantaire is drunk 
 it was to bossuet that he sent navet if he had come for me i would have followed him 
 so much the worse for enjolras 
 i go to his funeral 
 this resolution once arrived at bossuet joly and grantaire did not stir from the by two in the afternoon the table at which they sat was covered with empty bottles two candles were burning on it one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the other in the neck of a cracked carafe grantaire had seduced joly and bossuet to wine bossuet and joly had conducted grantaire back towards cheerfulness 
 as for grantaire he had got beyond wine that merely moderate inspirer of dreams ever since wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers 
 there is in fact in the matter of inebriety white magic and black magic wine is only white magic grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams 
 the blackness of a terrible fit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted him 
 he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass the is the abyss 
 having neither opium nor hashish on hand and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy stout absinthe which produces the most terrible of lethargies 
 it is of these three vapors beer brandy and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed 
 they are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed there in a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the slumbering psyche 
 grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it he was tremendously gay and bossuet and joly retorted they clinked glasses 
 grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn words at the big matelote 
 let the doors of the palace be thrown open 
 let every one be a member of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame hucheloup let us drink 
 and turning to madame hucheloup he added 
 woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate thee 
 and joly exclaimed 
 matelote and gibelotte gib grantaire anything more to drink he has already devoured since this bording in wild prodigality two francs and centibes 
 and grantaire began again 
 who has been unhooking the stars without my permission and putting them on the table in the guise of candles 
 bossuet though very drunk preserved his equanimity 
 he was seated on the sill of the open window wetting his back in the falling rain and gazing at his two friends 
 all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of to arms 
 he turned round and saw in the rue at the end of the rue de la chanvrerie enjolras passing gun in hand and gavroche with his pistol feuilly with his sword courfeyrac with his sword and jean prouvaire with his blunderbuss combeferre with his gun bahorel with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them 
 the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long bossuet improvised a from his two hands placed around his mouth and shouted 
 courfeyrac 
 courfeyrac 
 hohee 
 courfeyrac heard the shout caught sight of bossuet and advanced a few paces into the rue de la chanvrerie shouting 
 what do you want which crossed a where are you going 
 to make a barricade replied courfeyrac 
 well here 
 this is a good place 
 make it here 
 true aigle said courfeyrac 
 and at a signal from courfeyrac the mob flung themselves into the rue de la chanvrerie

 chapter iii 
 
 the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by the emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who were to watch actions and report upon them 
 besides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized the posts left vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in place and b in or on the contrary to put d in place and so on as if anything more than or satisfaction depended on this 
 as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen his chief of staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war which all these men believed they were directing but this affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen 
 prince michael ilarionovich wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino since september moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reports were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital but according to your last report you have even retreated farther serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from general reports i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several thousand men is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along the vladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the in view of all this information when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his guards in moscow is it possible that the forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the army entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow you have experienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will not weaken in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting 
 but by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in petersburg was dispatched kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place 
 on the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scouting killed one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french a cornet hearing the story informed his commander 
 the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of the superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities reported the incident to a general on the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive 
 if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite replied bennigsen 
 the report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was the final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled spring was released the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play despite all his supposed power his intellect his experience and his knowledge of men kutuzov having taken into consideration the report a note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer check the inevitable movement and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful gave his approval that is to the accomplished fact

 night begins to descend upon grantaire 
 the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit 
 corinthe created an obstacle the rue mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except from the rue that is to say in front and in full sight 
 bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal 
 terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob there was not a who did not get out of sight 
 in the space of a flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables windows blinds attic skylights shutters of every description were closed from the ground floor to the roof 
 a terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry 
 the alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the mob had rushed into my god 
 ah my god sighed mame hucheloup 
 bossuet had gone down to meet courfeyrac 
 joly who had placed himself at the window exclaimed 
 courfeyrac you ought to have brought an umbrella 
 you will gatch gold 
 in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the ten fathoms of street had been unpaved gavroche and bahorel had seized in its passage and overturned the dray of a named anceau this dray contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the piles of enjolras raised the cellar trap and all the widow empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime feuilly with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone 
 blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where the beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring and laid on the casks 
 when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man 
 there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing 
 matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers 
 gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish 
 her lassitude helped on the barricade she served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air 
 an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street 
 bossuet strode over the ran to it stopped the driver made the passengers alight offered his hand to the ladies 
 dismissed the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle 
 omnibuses said he do not pass the corinthe 
 non licet omnibus adire corinthum 
 an instant later the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will through the rue mondetour and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street 
 mame hucheloup quite upset had taken refuge in the first story 
 her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried in a low tone 
 her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat 
 the end of the world has come she muttered 
 joly deposited a kiss on mame fat red wrinkled neck and said to grantaire 
 my dear fellow i have always regarded a neck as an infinitely delicate thing 
 but grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb matelote had mounted to the first floor once more grantaire seized her round her waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window 
 matelote is homely he cried 
 matelote is of a dream of ugliness matelote is a chimaera 
 this is the secret of her birth a gothic pygmalion who was making gargoyles for cathedrals fell in love with one of them the most horrible one fine morning he besought love to give it life and this produced matelote look at her citizens 
 she has hair like mistress and she is a good girl 
 i guarantee that she will fight well 
 every good girl contains a hero 
 as for mother hucheloup an old warrior 
 look at her moustaches she inherited them from her husband 
 a hussar indeed 
 she will fight too 
 these two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue 
 comrades we shall overthrow the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid however that is a matter of perfect indifference to me 
 gentlemen my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics 
 i understand only love and liberty i am grantaire the good fellow 
 having never had any money i never acquired the habit of it and the result is that i have never lacked it but if i had been rich there would have been no more poor people 
 you would have seen 
 oh if the kind hearts only had fat purses how much better things would go 
 i picture myself jesus christ with fortune 
 how much good he would do 
 matelote embrace me 
 you are voluptuous and timid you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister and lips which claim the kiss of a lover 
 hold your tongue you cask said courfeyrac 
 grantaire retorted 
 i am the capitoul and the master of the floral games 
 municipal officer of toulouse 
 enjolras who was standing on the crest of the barricade gun in hand raised his beautiful austere face 
 enjolras as the reader knows had something of the spartan and of the puritan in his composition he would have perished at thermopylae with leonidas and burned at drogheda with cromwell 
 grantaire he shouted go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here 
 this is the place for enthusiasm not for drunkenness 
 disgrace the barricade 
 this angry speech produced a singular effect on grantaire 
 one would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face he seemed to be rendered suddenly sober 
 he sat down put his elbows on a table near the window looked at enjolras with indescribable gentleness and said to him 
 let me sleep here 
 go and sleep somewhere else cried enjolras 
 but grantaire still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him replied 
 let me sleep i die 
 enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes 
 grantaire you are incapable of believing of thinking of willing of living and of dying 
 grantaire replied in a grave tone 
 you will see 
 he stammered a few more unintelligible words then his head fell heavily on the table and as is the usual effect of the second period of inebriety into which enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him an instant later he had fallen asleep

 note and the information that the left flank of the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of october 
 on the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions toll read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the further arrangements 
 all right all right i time just now replied ermolov and left the hut 
 the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitz dispositions it was written though not in german this time 
 the first column will march here and here the second column will march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions and as is always the case not a single column reached its place at the appointed time 
 when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to deal with a young officer of the horse guards orderly pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to quarters 
 gone away said orderly 
 the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was often to be found 
 no and the out too 
 the officer mounting his horse rode off to someone else 
 no gone out 
 if only they make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance it is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one man said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals others said he must have returned home the officer searched till six in the evening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was the officer snatched a little food at a and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich miloradovich too was away but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general and that ermolov was probably there too 
 but where is it 
 why there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a country house in the far distance 
 what outside our line 
 put two regiments as outposts and having such a spree there awful two bands and three sets of singers 
 the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a dance song proceeding from the house 
 in the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts these sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him it was already past eight he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment room and the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups of singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and among them big imposing figure they all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility 
 ha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha ha 
 the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one of the generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informed ermolov 
 ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what the officer had to say took the papers from him without a word 
 you think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on the staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards referring to ermolov it was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into trouble see what a mess be tomorrow

 an attempt to console the widow hucheloup 
 bahorel in ecstasies over the barricade shouted 
 the street in its dress 
 how well it looks 
 courfeyrac as he demolished the to some extent sought to console the widowed proprietress 
 mother hucheloup you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law because gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window 
 yes my good monsieur courfeyrac 
 ah good heavens are you going to put that table of mine in your horror too 
 and it was for the counterpane and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs 
 if that an abomination what is 
 well mother hucheloup we are avenging you 
 mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account 
 she was satisfied after the manner of that arab woman who having received a box on the ear from her husband went to complain to her father and cried for vengeance saying father you owe my husband affront for affront 
 the father asked on which cheek did you receive the blow 
 on the left cheek the father slapped her right cheek and said 
 now you are satisfied go tell your husband that he boxed my ears and that i have accordingly boxed his 
 the rain had ceased 
 recruits had arrived 
 workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder a basket containing bottles of vitriol two or three carnival torches and a basket filled with left over from the festival this festival was very recent having taken place on the st of may it was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the faubourg named pepin 
 they smashed the only street lantern in the rue de la chanvrerie the lantern corresponding to one in the rue and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets de mondetour du cygne des precheurs and de la grande and de la 
 enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac directed everything 
 two barricades were now in process of construction at once both of them resting on the corinthe house and forming a right angle the larger shut off the rue de la chanvrerie the other closed the rue mondetour on the side of the rue de cygne 
 this last barricade which was very narrow was constructed only of casks and there were about fifty workers on it thirty were armed with guns for on their way they had effected a wholesale loan from an shop 
 nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop 
 one had a a cavalry sabre and two another was in his with a round hat and a slung at his side a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a awl there was one who was shouting 
 let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet 
 this man had no bayonet another spread out over his coat the and of a national guardsman the cover of the being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted 
 public order there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions few hats no cravats many bare arms some pikes 
 add to this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed longshoremen 
 all were in haste and as they helped each other they discussed the possible chances 
 that they would receive 
 succor about three in the they were sure of one regiment that paris would rise 
 terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality 
 one would have pronounced them brothers but they did not know each names great perils have this fine characteristic that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers 
 a fire had been lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets pewter mugs spoons forks and all the brass of the establishment in the midst of it all they drank 
 caps and buckshot were mixed on the tables with glasses of wine 
 in the mame hucheloup matelote and gibelotte variously modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another breathless and roused the third were tearing up old and making lint three insurgents were assisting them three jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble 
 the man of lofty stature whom courfeyrac combeferre and enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the rue des billettes was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there 
 gavroche was working on the larger one 
 as for the young man who had been waiting for courfeyrac at his lodgings and who had inquired for m marius he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned 
 gavroche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get everything in readiness 
 he went came mounted descended whistled and sparkled 
 he seemed to be there for the encouragement of all 
 had he any incentive 
 yes certainly his poverty had he wings yes certainly his joy 
 gavroche was a whirlwind 
 he was constantly visible he was incessantly audible he filled the air as he was everywhere at once 
 he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no halt was possible with him the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches 
 he troubled the loungers he excited the idle he reanimated the weary he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety in some and breath in others wrath in others movement in all now pricking a student now biting an artisan he alighted paused flew off again hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach 
 perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs 
 courage more more casks more machines where are you now 
 a hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with your barricade is very small 
 it must be carried up 
 put everything on it fling everything there stick it all in 
 break down the house a barricade is mother tea 
 hullo a glass door 
 this elicited an exclamation from the workers 
 a glass door what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle 
 hercules yourselves retorted gavroche 
 a glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade 
 it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the enemy taking it 
 so never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles 
 a glass door cuts the corns of the national guard when they try to mount on the barricade pardi glass is a treacherous thing 
 well you a very wildly lively imagination comrades 
 however he was furious over his triggerless pistol 
 he went from one to another demanding 
 a gun i want a gun 
 why you give me a gun 
 give you a gun said combeferre 
 come now said gavroche why not 
 i had one in when we had a dispute with charles x 
 enjolras shrugged his shoulders 
 when there are enough for the men we will give some to the children 
 gavroche wheeled round haughtily and answered 
 if you are killed before me i shall take yours 
 gamin said enjolras 
 greenhorn said gavroche 
 a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion 
 gavroche shouted to him 
 come with us young fellow well now we do anything for this old country of ours 
 the dandy fled

 next day the decrepit kutuzov having given orders to be called early said his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his caleche and drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles from tarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet he sat in the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun but all was still quiet a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving kutuzov looked at them searchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment they belonged to they belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then it may be a mistake thought the old commander in chief but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressed eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer the officer reported that no order to advance had been received 
 how not rec kutuzov began but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down when eykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appeared kutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blame for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground and he fell upon eykhen threatening him with his hands shouting and loading him with gross abuse another man captain brozin who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered the same fate 
 what sort of another blackguard are you have you shot scoundrels yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms and reeling 
 he was suffering physically he the commander in chief a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in russia to be placed in this position made the laughingstock of the whole army i have been in such a hurry to pray about today or have kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he to himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so and now he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress but his strength soon began to fail him and looking about him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again got into his caleche and drove back in silence 
 his wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and ermolov did not come to see him till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsyn and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day and once more kutuzov had to consent

 chapter vi 
 
 next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troops advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk out loud to smoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent their horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their destination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold ground but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been 
 only count with his cossacks the least important detachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading from the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk 
 toward dawn count who had dozed off was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polish sergeant of corps who explained in polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought long ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any of them and so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said that murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive count consulted his fellow officers 
 the offer was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguing grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant 
 now remember said count to the sergeant at parting if you have been lying have you hanged like a dog but if true you shall have a hundred gold pieces 
 without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled they disappeared into the forest and count having seen grekov off returned shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemy camp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right he looked in that direction but though the columns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french camp and his adjutant confirmed this 
 oh it is really too late said count orlov looking at the camp 
 as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he would lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops 
 i am sure that rascal was lying said the count 
 they can still be called back said one of his suite who like count orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the camp 
 eh really what do you think should we let them go on or not 
 will you have them fetched back 
 fetch them back fetch them back said count orlov with sudden determination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quite light 
 and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov when grekov returned count excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as well as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his men felt the same excitement 
 mount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and crossed themselves forward with aid 
 reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp 
 one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking up ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses 
 had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind and around them they would have captured murat and everything there that was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and guns were taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had to be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty divided not without some shouting and even a little themselves and it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves 
 the french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they formed into detachments and began firing still waiting for the other columns to arrive advanced no further 
 meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first column will march and so on the infantry of the belated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due order and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed places as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally a backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave vent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually even got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corps should long before have joined excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting old soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delay confusion and fell into a rage to surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll 
 i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division 
 coming out onto a field under the fire this brave general went straight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in his agitation whether going into action now with a single division would be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other bullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly

 waiting 
 during those hours of waiting what did they do 
 waiting 
 during those hours of waiting what did they do 
 we must needs tell since this is a matter of history 
 while the men made bullets and the women lint while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead destined to the smoked over a glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the barricade while enjolras whom it was impossible to divert kept an eye on the sentinels combeferre courfeyrac jean prouvaire feuilly bossuet joly bahorel and some others sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life and in one corner of this which had been converted into a casement a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to a supreme hour began to recite love verses 
 what verses 
 vous notre douce vie 
 lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux 
 et que nous au coeur envie 
 que bien mis et amoureux 
 ajoutant votre age a mon age 
 nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans 
 et que dans notre humble et petit menage 
 tout meme nous etait printemps 
 beaux jours manuel etait fier et sage 
 paris a de saints banquets 
 foy lancait la foudre et votre corsage 
 avait une epingle ou je me piquais 
 tout vous contemplait avocat sans causes 
 quand je vous menais au prado diner 
 vous etiez jolie au point que les roses 
 me faisaient de se retourner 
 je les entendais dire est elle belle 
 comme elle sent bon quels cheveux a flots 
 sous son mantelet elle cache une aile 
 son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos 
 avec toi pressant ton bras souple 
 les passants crovaient que charme 
 avait marie dans notre heureux couple 
 le doux mois au beau mois de mai 
 nous vivions caches contents porte close 
 devorant bon fruit defendu 
 ma bouche pas dit une chose 
 que deja ton coeur avait repondu 
 la sorbonne etait bucolique 
 ou je du soir au matin 
 ainsi ame amoureuse applique 
 la carte du tendre au pays latin 
 o place maubert o place dauphine 
 quand dans le taudis frais et printanier 
 tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine 
 je voyais un astre au fond du grenier 
 fort lu platon mais rien ne reste 
 mieux que malebranche et que lamennais 
 tu me demontrais la bonte celeste 
 avec une fleur que tu me donnais 
 je tu m etais soumise 
 o grenier dore te lacer te voir 
 aller et venir des en chemise 
 mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir 
 
 et qui done pourrait perde la memoire 
 de ces temps et de firmament 
 de rubans de fleurs de gaze et de moire 
 ou begaye un argot charmant 
 
 nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe 
 tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon 
 je prenais le bol de terre de pipe 
 et je te donnais le tasse en japon 
 
 et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire 
 ton manchon brule ton boa perdu 
 et ce cher portrait du divin shakespeare 
 soir pour souper nons avons vendu 
 mendiant et toi charitable 
 je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds 
 dante in folio nous servait de table 
 pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons 
 la premiere fois mon joyeux bouge 
 je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu 
 quand tu allais decoiffee et rouge 
 je restai tout pale et je crus en dieu 
 te nos bonheurs sans nombre 
 et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons 
 oh que de soupirs de nos coeurs pleins 
 se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds 
 do you remember our sweet life when we were both so young and when we had no other desire in our hearts than to be well dressed and in love 
 when by adding your age to my age we could not count forty years between us and when in our humble and tiny household everything was spring to us even in winter fair days 
 manuel was proud and wise paris sat at sacred banquets foy launched thunderbolts and your corsage had a pin on which i pricked myself 
 everything gazed upon you 
 a briefless lawyer when i took you to the prado to dine you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turn round and i heard them say is she not beautiful 
 how good she smells 
 what billowing hair beneath her mantle she hides a wing 
 her charming bonnet is hardly unfolded 
 i wandered with thee pressing thy supple arm the thought that love bewitched had wedded in our happy couple the gentle month of april to the fair month of may we lived concealed content with closed doors devouring love that sweet forbidden fruit 
 my mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart had already responded 
 the sorbonne was the bucolic spot where i adored thee from eve till morn 
 tis thus that an amorous soul applies the chart of the tender to the latin country o place maubert 
 o place dauphine 
 when in the fresh hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thy delicate leg i saw a star in the depths of the garret 
 i have read a great deal of plato but nothing of it remains by me better than malebranche and then lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me i obeyed thee thou didst submit to me oh gilded garret to lace thee to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror and who then would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament of flowers of gauze and of moire when love stammers a charming slang 
 our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips thou didst mask the window with thy petticoat i took the earthenware bowl and i gave thee the japanese cup 
 and those great misfortunes which made us laugh 
 thy cuff scorched thy boa lost 
 and that dear portrait of the divine shakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup 
 i was a beggar and thou wert charitable i kissed thy fresh round arms in haste 
 a folio dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a worth of chestnuts the first time that in my joyous den i snatched a kiss from thy fiery lip when thou wentest forth dishevelled and blushing i turned deathly pale and i believed in god 
 dost thou recall our innumerable joys and all those fichus changed to rags 
 oh what sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly depths 
 the hour the spot these souvenirs of youth recalled a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky the funeral repose of those deserted streets the imminence of the inexorable adventure which was in preparation gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by jean prouvaire who as we have said was a gentle poet 
 in the meantime a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade and in the large one one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way to la courtille 
 these torches as the reader has seen came from the faubourg 
 the torch had been placed in a sort of cage of closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag 
 the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous 
 this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and terrible purple

 meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front but kutuzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and as far as was in his power held the troops back he did not advance 
 he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering suggestions that they should attack 
 the word attack is always on your tongue but you see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich who asked permission to advance 
 we take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else 
 when kutuzov was informed that at the french rear where according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were now two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day 
 you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly 
 ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutuzov would content himself with that hint 
 having a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly nudging with his knee raevski who was at his side 
 soon after this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked 
 it is not too late yet your highness the enemy has not gone away if you were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as see a little smoke 
 kutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that troops were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour 
 the whole battle consisted in what cossacks had done the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly 
 in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff 
 how everything is done with us all said the russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves no battle tarutino borodino or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated that is an essential condition 
 a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course taken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force 
 if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces 
 if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false 
 the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions nor that which count may have had in view to take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia and destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tarutino just because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatest confusion the most important results of the whole campaign were attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which army had only awaited to begin its flight

 the man recruited in the rue des billettes 
 night was fully come nothing made its appearance 
 all that they heard was confused noises and at intervals fusillades but these were rare badly sustained and distant 
 this respite which was thus prolonged was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its forces 
 these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand 
 enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events 
 he went in search of gavroche who had set to making cartridges in the by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables these two candles cast no gleam outside 
 the insurgents had moreover taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories 
 gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with his cartridges 
 the man of the rue des billettes had just entered the and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted 
 a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it between his legs 
 gavroche who had been up to that moment distracted by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man 
 when he entered gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street urchin sprang to his feet 
 any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents with singular attention but from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on 
 the gamin approached this pensive personage and began to step around him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking at the same time over his childish countenance which was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so gay and so passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify ah bah impossible 
 my sight is bad 
 i am dreaming can this be no it is not but yes why no etc 
 gavroche balanced on his heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a bird expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip he was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled he had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering a venus among the blowsy females and the air of an amateur recognizing a raphael in a heap of daubs 
 his whole being was at work the instinct which scents out and the intelligence which combines 
 it was evident that a great event had happened in life 
 it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that enjolras accosted him 
 you are small said enjolras you will not be seen 
 go out of the barricade slip along close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the streets and come back and tell me what is going on 
 gavroche raised himself on his haunches 
 so the little chaps are good for something very lucky go 
 in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big ones 
 and gavroche raising his head and lowering his voice added as he indicated the man of the rue des billettes do you see that big fellow there 
 well 
 a police spy 
 are you sure of it 
 it two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port royal where i was taking the air by my ear 
 enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand 
 the man left the room and returned almost immediately accompanied by three others 
 the four men four porters with broad shoulders went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning with his elbows they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him 
 then enjolras approached the man and demanded of him 
 who are you 
 at this abrupt query the man started 
 he plunged his gaze deep into enjolras clear eyes and appeared to grasp the meaning he smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty gravity 
 i see what it is 
 well yes 
 you are a police spy 
 i am an agent of the authorities 
 and your name 
 javert 
 enjolras made a sign to the four men 
 in the twinkling of an eye before javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pinioned and searched 
 they found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with this motto 
 supervision and vigilance and on the other this note javert inspector of police aged and the signature of the prefect of police of that day m gisquet 
 besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several gold pieces 
 they left him his purse and his watch 
 under the watch at the bottom of his fob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope which enjolras unfolded and on which he read these five lines written in the very hand of the prefect of police 
 as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine near the jena bridge 
 the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the its name 
 gavroche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and said to him 
 the mouse who has caught the cat 
 all this was so rapidly executed that it was all over when those about the noticed it 
 javert had not uttered a single cry 
 at the sight of javert bound to the post courfeyrac bossuet joly combeferre and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up 
 javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied 
 he is a police spy said enjolras 
 and turning to javert 
 you will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken 
 javert replied in his most imperious tone 
 why not at once 
 we are saving our powder 
 then finish the business with a blow from a knife 
 spy said the handsome enjolras we are judges and not assassins 
 then he called gavroche 
 here you go about your business 
 do what i told you 
 going cried gavroche 
 and halting as he was on the point of setting out 
 by the way you will give me his gun and he added 
 i leave you the musician but i want the clarionet 
 the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade

 chapter viii 
 
 napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and incalculable wealth is in hands the russian army only half the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month position is most brilliant he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolensk or vilna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow the troops to loot to prepare winter clothing of which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the provisions of which according to the french historians there were enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of the army took none of these steps 
 he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg or on or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov afterwards took nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troops plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him he quitted moscow approached kutuzov without joining battle turned to the right and reached again without attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took but retiring instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road nothing more stupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the army as the sequel showed had aim been to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of anything the russian army might do 
 napoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius 
 in both cases his personal activity having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that guided the event 
 the historians quite falsely represent faculties as having weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french or german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in germany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right 
 his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere order after order order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it the absence of citizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did not disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare of the people of russia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace

 many interrogation points with regard to a certain le cabuc whose name may not have been le cabuc 
 the tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete the reader would not see those grand moments of social in a revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort in their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after departure 
 mobs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they roll along a throng of tumultuous men 
 these men do not ask each other whence they come 
 among the who had joined the rabble led by enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the shoulders who gesticulated and vociferated and who had the look of a drunken savage 
 this man whose name or nickname was le cabuc and who was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so and had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the this cabuc while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the rue all at once he exclaimed 
 do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire when we are at the windows the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street 
 yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers 
 let us knock 
 they will not open 
 let us break in the door 
 le cabuc runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks the door opens not 
 he strikes a second blow 
 no one answers a third stroke 
 the same silence 
 is there any one here shouts cabuc 
 nothing stirs 
 then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end 
 it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of oak lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays a genuine prison postern 
 the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble but did not shake the door 
 nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a old man who was the porter and who held a candle 
 the man who was knocking paused 
 gentlemen said the porter what do you want 
 open said cabuc 
 that cannot be gentlemen 
 open nevertheless 
 impossible gentlemen 
 le cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and as it was very dark the porter did not see him 
 will you open yes or no 
 no gentlemen 
 do you say no 
 i say no my goo 
 the porter did not finish 
 the shot was fired the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the jugular vein 
 the old man fell back without a sigh 
 the candle fell and was extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the small window and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof 
 there said le cabuc dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement 
 he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an talon and he heard a voice saying to him 
 on your knees 
 the murderer turned round and saw before him enjolras cold white face 
 enjolras held a pistol in his hand 
 he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge 
 he had seized collar blouse shirt and suspender with his left hand 
 on your knees he repeated 
 and with an imperious motion the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees in the mire 
 le cabuc attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand 
 enjolras pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his face had about him at that moment something of the antique themis his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes gave to his implacable greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which as the ancient world viewed the matter befit justice 
 the whole barricade hastened up then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold 
 le cabuc vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every limb 
 enjolras released him and drew out his watch 
 collect yourself said he 
 think or pray 
 you have one minute 
 mercy murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths 
 enjolras never took his eyes off of him 
 he allowed a minute to pass then he replaced his watch in his fob 
 that done he grasped le cabuc by the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear many of those intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures turned aside their heads 
 an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards 
 enjolras straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance around him 
 then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said 
 throw that outside 
 three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled and flung it over the little barricade into the rue mondetour 
 enjolras was thoughtful 
 it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity 
 all at once he raised his voice 
 a silence fell upon them 
 citizens said enjolras what that man did is frightful what i have done is horrible 
 he killed therefore i killed him i had to do it because insurrection must have its discipline assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of duty and must not be possible to slander our combat i have therefore tried that man and condemned him to death as for myself constrained as i am to do what i have done and yet abhorring it i have judged myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself 
 those who listened to him shuddered 
 we will share thy fate cried combeferre 
 so be it replied enjolras 
 one word more 
 in executing this man i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world name is fatality 
 now the law of progress is that monsters shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall vanish before fraternity 
 it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love 
 no matter i do pronounce it and i glorify it 
 love the future is thine 
 death i make use of thee but i hate thee 
 citizens in the future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance nor bloody retaliation 
 as there will be no more satan there will be no more michael 
 in the future no one will kill any one else the earth will beam with radiance the human race will love the day will come citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and life it will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die 
 enjolras ceased 
 his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility his staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones 
 jean prouvaire and combeferre pressed each hands silently and leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion that grave young man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also of rock 
 let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched a police card was found on le cabuc 
 the author of this book had in his hands in the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in 
 we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which is strange but probably well founded le cabuc was claquesous the fact is that dating from the death of le cabuc there was no longer any question of claquesous 
 claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible 
 his life had been all shadows his end was night 
 the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius 
 this lad who had a bold and reckless air had come by night to join the insurgents

 chapter i 
 
 from the rue plumet to the quartier 
 the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny 
 he wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness offered him the key 
 these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair are tempting marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said 
 i will go 
 mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all 
 he set out at rapid pace 
 he found himself most opportunely armed as he had pistols with him 
 the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street 
 marius who had emerged from the rue plumet by the boulevard traversed the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs elysees the place louis xv and reached the rue de rivoli the shops were open there the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their purchases in the stalls people were eating ices in the cafe laiter and nibbling small cakes at the english shop 
 only a few were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice 
 marius entered the rue through the passage delorme there the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their doors people were walking about the street lanterns were lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as usual 
 there was cavalry on the place du 
 marius followed the rue in proportion as he left the behind him there were fewer lighted windows the shops were fast shut no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density 
 for the now amounted to a crowd 
 no one could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur 
 near the fountain of the there were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water 
 at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires the crowd no longer walked it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones 
 there were hardly any black coats or round hats now but smock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaverous heads this multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration 
 although not one of them was walking a dull trampling was audible in the mire beyond this dense portion of the throng in the rue du roule in the rue des prouvaires and in the extension of the rue there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance 
 the lanterns of that date resembled large red stars hanging to ropes and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider these streets were not deserted 
 there could be descried piles of guns moving bayonets and troops bivouacking 
 no curious observer passed that limit 
 there circulation ceased 
 there the rabble ended and the army began 
 marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more 
 he had been summoned he must go 
 he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrols he avoided the sentinels 
 he made a circuit reached the rue de bethisy and directed his course towards the halles 
 at the corner of the rue des bourdonnais there were no longer any lanterns 
 after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling 
 there was no longer a no longer a soldier no longer a light there was no one solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon one 
 entering a street was like entering a cellar 
 he continued to advance 
 he took a few steps 
 some one passed close to him at a run 
 was it a man 
 or a woman 
 were there many of them he could not have told it had passed and vanished 
 proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a lane which he judged to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in contact with an obstacle 
 he extended his hands it was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and scattered and piled up a barricade had been begun there and abandoned 
 he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier he walked very near the and guided himself along the walls of the houses 
 a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him he approached it took on a form 
 it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by bossuet in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man understands the actions of providence 
 marius left the horses behind him 
 as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du a shot coming no one knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by him and the bullet pierced a brass suspended above his head over a shop this pierced was still to be seen in in the rue du at the corner of the pillars of the market 
 this shot still betokened life 
 from that instant forth he encountered nothing more 
 the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps 
 nevertheless marius pressed forward

 but strange to say all these measures efforts and plans which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did not affect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels 
 with reference to the military side the plan of campaign that work of genius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anything more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into a polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was or could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosquee as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless the mining of the kremlin only helped toward fulfilling wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which napoleon was so concerned produced an result the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men and according to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin by the skill and apparently the genius of murat 
 with reference to diplomacy all arguments as to his magnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage 
 with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down 
 with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being looted 
 with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by visit to a mosque no results were achieved two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of another that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church that night the doors were again broken open the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders perpetrated 
 with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them 
 as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in the kremlin and in house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed 
 even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the french collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold 
 but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was attempt to stop the looting and discipline 
 this is what the army authorities were reporting 
 looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen goods 
 the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the rd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly witnessed 
 nothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging october 
 robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october 
 the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning to the kremlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them 
 the grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor 
 that army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not go away 
 it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolensk road and by the battle of tarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding 
 fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen napoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers says and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions the sick and the wounded 
 the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal hearing a rustle rushes straight at the gun runs forward and back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from his whole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the gun reached him turned back and finally like any wild beast ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent was familiar 
 during the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who holding a couple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it

 of expense 
 riches are for spending and spending for honour and good actions therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by the worth of the occasion for voluntary undoing may be as well for a country as for the kingdom of heaven but ordinary expense ought to be limited by a estate and governed with such regard as it 
 be within his compass and not subject to deceit and abuse of servants and ordered to the best show that the bills may be less than the estimation abroad 
 
 certainly if a man will keep but of even hand his ordinary expenses ought to be but to the half of his receipts and if he think to wax rich but to the third part 
 it is no baseness for the greatest to descend and look into their own estate some forbear it not upon negligence alone but doubting to bring themselves into melancholy in respect they shall find it broken but wounds cannot be cured without searching he that cannot look into his own estate at all had need both choose well those whom he employeth and change them often for new are more timorous and less subtle he that can look into his estate but seldom it behoveth him to turn all to certainties a man had need if he be plentiful in some kind of expense to be as saving again in some other as if he be plentiful in diet to be saving in apparel if he be plentiful in the hall to be saving in the stable and the like for he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds will hardly be preserved from decay in clearing 
 of a estate he may as well hurt himself in being too sudden as in letting it run on too long for hasty selling is commonly as disadvantageable as interest 
 
 besides he that clears at once will relapse for finding himself out of straits he will revert to his customs but he that cleareth by degrees induceth a habit of frugality and gained as well upon his mind as upon his estate 
 certainly who hath a state to repair may not despise small things and commonly it is less dishonourable to abridge petty charges than to stoop to petty gettings a man ought warily to begin charges which once begun will continue but in matters that return not he may be more magnificent

 chapter xiii 
 
 little gervais 
 jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it he set out at a very hasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps 
 he wandered thus the whole morning without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations 
 he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not know against whom it was directed he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated there came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life 
 this state of mind fatigued him 
 he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him he asked himself what would replace this 
 at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the here and there whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood 
 these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since they had recurred to him 
 unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long 
 as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted 
 there was nothing on the horizon except the alps 
 not even the spire of a distant village jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from d a path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush 
 in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him a joyous sound became audible 
 he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his on his hip and his on his back 
 one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers 
 without stopping his song the lad halted in his march from time to time and played at with some coins which he had in his whole fortune probably 
 among this money there was one piece 
 the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand 
 this time the piece escaped him and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean 
 jean valjean set his foot upon it 
 in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him 
 he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man 
 the spot was absolutely solitary 
 as far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path 
 the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height 
 the child was standing with his back to the sun which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its gleam the savage face of jean valjean 
 sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money 
 what is your name said jean valjean 
 little gervais sir 
 go away said jean valjean 
 sir resumed the child give me back my money 
 jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply 
 the child began again my money sir 
 jean eyes remained fixed on the earth 
 my piece of money cried the child my white piece my silver 
 it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him 
 the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him 
 at the same time he made an effort to displace the big shoe which rested on his treasure 
 i want my piece of money my piece of forty sous 
 the child wept 
 jean valjean raised his head 
 he still remained seated 
 his eyes were troubled 
 he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice there 
 i sir replied the child 
 little gervais 
 i 
 give me back my forty sous if you please 
 take your foot away sir if you please 
 then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing 
 come now will you take your foot away 
 take your foot away or see 
 ah 
 still you said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his feet his foot still resting on the silver piece he added 
 will you take yourself off 
 the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry 
 nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own revery 
 at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared 
 the sun had set 
 the shadows were descending around jean valjean 
 he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish 
 he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the flight 
 the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals 
 his gaze fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening 
 he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel 
 at that moment he caught sight of the piece which his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles 
 it was as though he had received a galvanic shock what is this he muttered between his teeth 
 he recoiled three paces then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him 
 at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge 
 he saw nothing 
 night was falling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight 
 he said ah and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared 
 after about thirty paces he paused looked about him and saw nothing 
 then he shouted with all his might 
 little gervais 
 little gervais 
 he paused and waited 
 there was no reply 
 the landscape was gloomy and deserted 
 he was encompassed by space there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and a silence which engulfed his voice 
 an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life 
 the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury 
 one would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one 
 he set out on his march again then he began to run and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little gervais 
 little gervais 
 assuredly if the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself 
 but the child was no doubt already far away 
 he encountered a priest on horseback 
 he stepped up to him and said 
 monsieur le cure have you seen a child pass 
 no said the priest 
 one named little gervais 
 i have seen no one 
 he drew two pieces from his and handed them to the priest 
 monsieur le cure this is for your poor people 
 monsieur le cure he was a little lad about ten years old with a marmot i think and a one of those savoyards you know 
 i have not seen him 
 little gervais 
 there are no villages here 
 can you tell me 
 if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger such persons pass through these parts 
 we know nothing of them 
 jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence and gave them to the priest 
 for your poor he said 
 then he added wildly 
 monsieur have me arrested 
 i am a thief 
 the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste much alarmed 
 jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken 
 in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling shouting but he met no one 
 two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth at length at a spot where three paths intersected each other he stopped 
 the moon had risen 
 he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little gervais 
 little gervais little gervais 
 his shout died away in the mist without even awakening an echo 
 he murmured yet once more little gervais but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice 
 it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch 
 then his heart burst and he began to cry 
 it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years 
 when jean valjean left the house he was as we have seen quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man 
 you have promised me to become an honest man i buy your soul 
 i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the good god 
 this recurred to his mind unceasingly 
 to this celestial kindness he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man 
 in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated 
 as he walked thus with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer remained a middle course for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behooved him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict that if he wished to become good be must become an angel that if he wished to remain evil he must become a monster 
 here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere 
 did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confused way 
 misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated 
 if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion 
 on emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his soul as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark 
 the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors and anxiety 
 he no longer knew where he really was 
 like an owl who should suddenly see the sun rise the convict had been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue 
 that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everything about him was changed that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him 
 in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous 
 why 
 he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force 
 it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that 
 let us say it simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto thoughts besetting it 
 when intelligence and beheld that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror 
 it was phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found stealing the money from that child he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable 
 however that may be this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other 
 first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recognized the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch he had just perceived what he was and he was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom and as if he had there before him in flesh and blood the hideous jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects 
 excess of unhappiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort a visionary 
 this then was in the nature of a vision he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by him 
 his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality one no longer beholds the object which one has before one and one sees as though apart from self the figures which one has in own mind 
 thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch 
 on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop 
 his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the bishop and jean valjean 
 nothing less than the first was required to soften the second 
 by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his revery continued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish 
 after a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade 
 all at once he disappeared the bishop alone remained he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance 
 jean valjean wept for a long time 
 he wept burning tears he sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child 
 as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary light a light at once ravishing and terrible his past life his first fault his long expiation his external brutishness his internal hardness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance what had happened to him at the the last thing that he had done that theft of forty sous from a child a crime all the more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed 
 he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it seemed frightful to him in the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise 
 how many hours did he weep thus 
 what did he do after he had wept whither did he go 
 no one ever knew 
 the only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served grenoble at that epoch and who arrived at d about three in the morning saw as he traversed the street in which the residence was situated a man in the attitude of prayer kneeling on the pavement in the shadow in front of the door of monseigneur welcome

 princess leia was smiling her eyes were wide and sparkling with a wondrousglow she looked just as she had that first time he saw lifetime ago first projected her holographic image and in gown of purest white she looked angelic 
 raising his hand luke offered it to the expert service of thesurgeon droid examined the bionic hand that was skillfully fused to the robot wrapped a soft metalized strip about the hand and attached a smallelectronic unit to the strip tightening it slightly luke made a fist with his new handand felt the healing pulsations imparted by apparatus then he let hishand and arm relax 
 leia and the two droids moved closer to luke as a voice came over an intercomloudspeaker it was lando luke the voice blared ready for takeoff 
 lando calrissian sat in the millennium chair he had missedhis old freighter but now that he was once again its captain he felt quiteuncomfortable in his chair the great wookiee chewbacca noticed his discomfort while he began to throw the switches to ready the ship fortakeoff

 book one 
 chapter xxviii 
 
 prince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not altering his routine retired as usual after dinner the little princess was in her room prince andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with silver plate two turkish pistols and a saber a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of ochakov all these traveling effects of prince were in very good order new clean and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes 
 when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future prince face looked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or was he sad at leaving his wife perhaps both but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard 
 i hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry with me for coming you have changed so andrusha she added as if to explain such a question 
 she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrusha it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrusha the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood 
 and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a smile 
 she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room oh andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a dear merry child i have grown so fond of her 
 prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face 
 one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them andrew forget that she has grown up and been educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into situation tout comprendre tout pardonner think it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to be parted from her husband and be left alone the country in her condition very hard 
 to understand all is to forgive all 
 prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand 
 you live in the country and think the life terrible he replied 
 i different why speak of me i want any other life and for i know no other but think andrew for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society there is only mademoiselle bourienne 
 i like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince andrew 
 no she is very nice and kind and above all much to be pitied she has no one no one to tell the truth i need her and even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even more so i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says we love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we have done them father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father she is very and my father likes her way of reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly 
 to be quite frank mary i expect character sometimes makes things trying for you it prince andrew asked suddenly 
 princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question 
 for me for me trying for me said she 
 he always was rather harsh and now i should think getting very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister 
 you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation and a great sin how can one judge father but even if one might what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contented and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i am 
 her brother shook his head incredulously 
 the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth andrew is way of treating religious subjects i understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing that makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with 
 ah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly 
 ah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me andrew she said timidly after a silence i have a great favor to ask of you 
 what is it dear 
 no promise that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise andrusha said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted 
 she looked timidly at her brother 
 even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew as if guessing what it was about 
 think what you please i know you are just like father think as you please but do this for my sake please do father our grandfather wore it in all his wars she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule so you promise 
 of course what is it 
 andrew i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off do you promise 
 if it does not weigh a hundredweight and break my neck to please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his face he repented and added i am glad really dear i am very glad 
 against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small oval antique icon of the saviour in a gold setting on a finely wrought silver chain 
 she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew 
 please andrew for my sake 
 rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those eyes lit up the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful her brother would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face 
 thank you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa they were silent for a while 
 as i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always used to be judge lise harshly she began she is so sweet so and her position now is a very hard one 
 i do not think i have complained of my wife to you masha or blamed her why do you say all this to me 
 red patches appeared on princess face and she was silent as if she felt guilty 
 i have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and i am sorry for that he went on 
 the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks she tried to say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her fate her and her husband after crying she had fallen asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister 
 know this masha i reproach have not reproached and never shall reproach my wife with anything and i cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth if you want to know whether i am happy no is she happy no but why this is so i know 
 as he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway 
 let us go to her i must say or go and wake and come in a moment petrushka he called to his valet come here take these away put this on the seat and this to the right 
 princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said andrew if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been answered 
 well may be said prince andrew go masha come immediately 
 on the way to his room in the passage which connected one wing with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and artless smile she had met him in secluded passages 
 oh i thought you were in your room she said for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes 
 prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word when he reached his room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying one word after another came through the open door she was speaking as usual in french and as if after long she wished to make up for lost time 
 no but imagine the old countess zubova with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age ha ha ha mary 
 this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases prince andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after their journey she answered him and continued her chatter 
 the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid to the young prince the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall michael ivanovich mademoiselle bourienne princess mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his study as the latter wished to say to him alone all were waiting for them to come out 
 when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his son sat at the table writing he glanced round 
 going and he went on writing 
 come to say 
 kiss me here and he touched his cheek thanks thanks 
 what do you thank me for 
 for not and not hanging to a apron strings the service before everything thanks thanks and he went on writing so that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have anything to say say it these two things can be done together he added 
 about my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands 
 why talk nonsense say what you want 
 when her confinement is due send to moscow for an accoucheur let him be here 
 the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his stern eyes on his son 
 i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said prince andrew evidently confused i know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened 
 hm hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was writing do it 
 he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh 
 a bad business eh 
 what is bad father 
 the wife said the old prince briefly and significantly 
 i understand said prince andrew 
 no it be helped lad said the prince all like that one unmarry be afraid i tell anyone but you know it yourself 
 he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked straight into his face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him and again laughed his frigid laugh 
 the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him the old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity 
 to be done pretty i will do everything make your mind easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter 
 andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him the old man got up and gave the letter to his son 
 listen said he worry about your wife what can be done shall be now listen give this letter to michael ilarionovich i have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant a bad position tell him i remember and like him write and tell me how he receives you if he is all right serve him nicholas son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor now come here 
 kutuzov 
 he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised the lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his bold tall close handwriting 
 i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs hand them to the emperor after my death now here is a lombard bond and a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of wars send it to the academy here are some jottings for you to read when i am gone you will find them useful 
 andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet he felt that he must not say it 
 i will do it all father he said 
 well now he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt me your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like a son of nicholas bolkonski i shall be ashamed 
 you need not have said that to me father said the son with a smile 
 the old man was silent 
 i also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew if killed and if i have a son do not let him be taken away from you as i said yesterday let him grow up with you please 
 not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed 
 they stood silent facing one another the old sharp eyes were fixed straight on his something twitched in the lower part of the old face 
 said go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice opening his door 
 what is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice 
 prince andrew sighed and made no reply 
 well he said turning to his wife 
 and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now go through your performance 
 andrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband 
 he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder 
 he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face and carefully placed her in an easy chair 
 adieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps 
 the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafing her temples princess mary supporting her still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction from the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out 
 gone all right said he and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door

 chapter 
 
 on the fifth morning or rather afternoon a different step and shorter and this time the person entered the room it was zillah donned in her scarlet shawl with a black silk bonnet on her head and a willow basket swung to her arm 
 eh dear mrs dean she exclaimed well there is a talk about you at gimmerton i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh and missy with you till master told me been found and lodged you here what and you must have got on an island sure and how long were you in the hole did master save you mrs dean but not so not been so poorly have you 
 your master is a true scoundrel i replied but he shall answer for it he have raised that tale it shall all be laid bare 
 what do you mean asked zillah not his tale they tell that in the your being lost in the marsh and i calls to earnshaw when i come queer things mr hareton happened since i went off a sad pity of that likely young lass and cant nelly dean he stared i thought he had not heard aught so i told him the rumour the master listened and he just smiled to himself and said if they have been in the marsh they are out now zillah nelly dean is lodged at this minute in your room you can tell her to flit when you go up here is the key the bog water got into her head and she would have run home quite flighty but i fixed her till she came round to her senses you can bid her go to the grange at once if she be able and carry a message from me that her young lady will follow in time to attend the funeral 
 mr edgar is not dead i gasped oh zillah zillah 
 no no sit you down my good mistress she replied right sickly yet not dead doctor kenneth thinks he may last another day i met him on the road and asked 
 instead of sitting down i snatched my outdoor things and hastened below for the way was free on entering the house i looked about for someone to give information of catherine the place was filled with sunshine and the door stood wide open but nobody seemed at hand as i hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth linton lay on the settle sole tenant sucking a stick of and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes where is miss catherine i demanded sternly supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence by catching him thus alone he sucked on like an innocent 
 is she gone i said 
 no he replied upstairs not to go we let her 
 you let her little idiot i exclaimed direct me to her room immediately or make you sing out sharply 
 papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there he answered he says not to be soft with catherine my wife and shameful that she should wish to leave me he says she hates me and wants me to die that she may have my money but she have it and she go home she never may cry and be sick as much as she pleases 
 he resumed his former occupation closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep 
 master heathcliff i resumed have you forgotten all kindness to you last winter when you affirmed you loved her and when she brought you books and sung you songs and came many a time through wind and snow to see you she wept to miss one evening because you would be disappointed and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you and now you believe the lies your father tells though you know he detests you both and you join him against her fine gratitude is it not 
 the corner of mouth fell and he took the from his lips 
 did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you i continued think for yourself as to your money she does not even know that you will have any and you say sick and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house you who have felt what it is to be so neglected you could pity your own sufferings and she pitied them too but you pity hers i shed tears master heathcliff you elderly woman and a servant you after pretending such affection and having reason to worship her almost store every tear you have for yourself and lie there quite at ease ah a heartless selfish boy 
 i stay with her he answered crossly not stay by myself she cries so i bear it and she give over though i say call my father i did call him once and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet but she began again the instant he left the room moaning and grieving all night long though i screamed for vexation that i sleep 
 is mr heathcliff out i inquired perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his mental tortures 
 in the court he replied talking to dr kenneth who says uncle is dying truly at last glad for i shall be master of the grange after catherine always spoke of it as her house it hers mine papa says everything she has is mine all her nice books are mine she offered to give me them and her pretty birds and her pony minny if i would get the key of our room and let her out but i told her she had nothing to give they were all all mine and then she cried and took a little picture from her neck and said i should have that two pictures in a gold case on one side her mother and on the other uncle when they were young that was said they were mine too and tried to get them from her the spiteful thing let me she pushed me off and hurt me i shrieked frightens heard papa coming and she broke the hinges and divided the case and gave me her portrait the other she attempted to hide but papa asked what was the matter and i explained it he took the one i had away and ordered her to resign hers to me she refused and struck her down and wrenched it off the chain and crushed it with his foot 
 and were you pleased to see her struck i asked having my designs in encouraging his talk 
 i winked he answered i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse he does it so hard yet i was glad at deserved punishing for pushing me but when papa was gone she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside against her teeth and her mouth filling with blood and then she gathered up the bits of the picture and went and sat down with her face to the wall and she has never spoken to me since and i sometimes think she speak for pain i like to think so but a naughty thing for crying continually and she looks so pale and wild afraid of her 
 and you can get the key if you choose i said 
 yes when upstairs he answered but i walk upstairs now 
 in what apartment is it i asked 
 oh he cried i tell you where it is it is our secret nobody neither hareton nor zillah is to know there tired away go away and he turned his face on to his arm and shut his eyes again 
 i considered it best to depart without seeing mr heathcliff and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange on reaching it the astonishment of my to see me and their joy also was intense and when they heard that their little mistress was safe two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr door but i bespoke the announcement of it myself how changed i found him even in those few days he lay an image of sadness and resignation waiting his death very young he looked though his actual age was one would have called him ten years younger at least he thought of catherine for he murmured her name i touched his hand and spoke 
 catherine is coming dear master i whispered she is alive and well and will be here i hope tonight 
 i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence he half rose up looked eagerly round the apartment and then sank back in a swoon as soon as he recovered i related our compulsory visit and detention at the heights i said heathcliff forced me to go in which was not quite true i uttered as little as possible against linton nor did i describe all his brutal intentions being to add no bitterness if i could help it to his already overflowing cup 
 he divined that one of his purposes was to secure the personal property as well as the estate to his son or rather himself yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together however he felt that his will had better be altered instead of leaving fortune at her own disposal he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life and for her children if she had any after her by that means it could not fall to mr heathcliff should linton die 
 having received his orders i dispatched a man to fetch the attorney and four more provided with serviceable weapons to demand my young lady of her jailer both parties were delayed very late the single servant returned first he said mr green the lawyer was out when he arrived at his house and he had to wait two hours for his and then mr green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning the four men came back unaccompanied also they brought word that catherine was ill too ill to quit her room and heathcliff would not suffer them to see her i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale which i would not carry to my master resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights at daylight and storm it literally unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us her father shall see her i vowed and vowed again if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it 
 happily i was spared the journey and the trouble i had gone downstairs at three to fetch a jug of water and was passing through the hall with it in my hand when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump oh it is green i said recollecting green and i went on intending to send somebody else to open it but the knock was repeated not loud and still importunately i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself the harvest moon shone clear outside it was not the attorney my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing 
 ellen ellen is papa alive 
 yes i cried yes my angel he is god be thanked you are safe with us again 
 she wanted to run breathless as she was upstairs to mr room but i compelled her to sit down on a chair and made her drink and washed her pale face chafing it into a faint colour with my apron then i said i must go first and tell of her arrival imploring her to say she should be happy with young heathcliff she stared but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood she assured me she would not complain 
 i abide to be present at their meeting i stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour and hardly ventured near the bed then all was composed however despair was as silent as her joy she supported him calmly in appearance and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy 
 he died blissfully mr lockwood he died so kissing her cheek he murmured 
 i am going to her and you darling child shall come to us and never stirred or spoke again but continued that rapt radiant gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed none could have noticed the exact minute of his death it was so entirely without a struggle 
 whether catherine had spent her tears or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow she sat there till the sun rose she sat till noon and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose it was well i succeeded in removing her for at dinner time appeared the lawyer having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave he had sold himself to mr heathcliff and that was the cause of his delay in obeying my summons fortunately no thought of worldly affairs crossed the mind to disturb him after his arrival 
 mr green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place he gave all the servants but me notice to quit he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar linton should not be buried beside his wife but in the chapel with his family there was the will however to hinder that and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions the funeral was hurried over catherine mrs linton heathcliff now was suffered to stay at the grange till her corpse had quitted it 
 she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk of liberating her she heard the men i sent disputing at the door and she gathered the sense of answer it drove her desperate linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left was terrified into fetching the key before his father he had the cunning to unlock and relock the door without shutting it and when he should have gone to bed he begged to sleep with hareton and his petition was granted for once catherine stole out before break of day she dare not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows and luckily lighting on her she got easily out of its lattice and on to the ground by means of the fir tree close by her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape notwithstanding his timid contrivances

 chapter 
 
 like most other young matrons meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper john should find home a paradise he should always see a smiling face should fare sumptuously every day and never know the loss of a button she brought so much love energy and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed in spite of some obstacles her paradise was not a tranquil one for the little woman fussed was to please and bustled about like a true martha cumbered with many cares she was too tired sometimes even to smile john grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare as for buttons she soon learned to wonder where they went to shake her head over the carelessness of men and to threaten to make him sew them on himself and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers 
 they were very happy even after they discovered that they live on love alone john did not find beauty diminished though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot nor did meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry shall i send some veal or mutton for dinner darling the little house ceased to be a glorified bower but it became a home and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better at first they played and frolicked over it like children then john took steadily to business feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders and meg laid by her cambric wrappers put on a big apron and fell to work as before said with more energy than discretion 
 while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise working out the problems with patience and care sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes or lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little hummels an evening with john over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm and a frugal fit would ensue during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding hash and coffee which tried his soul although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude before the golden mean was found however meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without a family jar 
 fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves she undertook to put up her own currant jelly john was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once as john firmly believed that my wife was equal to anything and took a natural pride in her skill he resolved that she should be gratified and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use home came four dozen delightful little pots half a barrel of sugar and a small boy to pick the currants for her with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap arms bared to the elbow and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib the young housewife fell to work feeling no doubts about her success for she seen hannah do it hundreds of times the array of pots rather amazed her at first but john was so fond of jelly and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf that meg resolved to fill them all and spend a long day picking boiling straining and fussing over her jelly she did her best she asked advice of mrs cornelius she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she left undone she reboiled resugared and restrained but that dreadful stuff jell 
 she longed to run home bib and all and ask mother to lend her a hand but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries experiments or quarrels they had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one but they had held to their resolve and whenever they could get on without help they did so and no one interfered for mrs march had advised the plan so meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day and at five sat down in her kitchen wrung her bedaubed hands lifted up her voice and wept 
 now in the first flush of the new life she had often said my husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes i shall always be prepared there shall be no flurry no scolding no discomfort but a neat house a cheerful wife and a good dinner john dear never stop to ask my leave invite whom you please and be sure of a welcome from me 
 how charming that was to be sure john quite glowed with pride to hear her say it and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now it always happens so in this vale of tears there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at deplore and bear as we best can 
 if john had not forgotten all about the jelly it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day of all the days in the year to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce when his pretty wife came running out to meet him he escorted his friend to his mansion with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband 
 it is a world of disappointments as john discovered when he reached the dovecote the front door usually stood hospitably open now it was not only shut but locked and mud still adorned the steps the parlor windows were closed and curtained no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza in white with a distracting little bow in her hair or a hostess smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest nothing of the sort for not a soul appeared but a boy asleep under the current bushes 
 afraid something has happened step into the garden scott while i look up mrs brooke said john alarmed at the silence and solitude 
 round the house he hurried led by a pungent smell of burned sugar and mr scott strolled after him with a queer look on his face he paused discreetly at a distance when brooke disappeared but he could both see and hear and being a bachelor enjoyed the prospect mightily 
 in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot another lay upon the floor and a third was burning gaily on the stove lotty with teutonic phlegm was calmly eating bread and currant wine for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state while mrs brooke with her apron over her head sat sobbing dismally 
 my dearest girl what is the matter cried john rushing in with awful visions of scalded hands sudden news of affliction and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden 
 oh john i am so tired and hot and cross and worried been at it till all worn out do come and help me or i shall die and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor 
 what worries you dear has anything dreadful happened asked the anxious john tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap which was all askew 
 yes sobbed meg despairingly 
 tell me quick then cry i can bear anything better than that out with it love jelly jell and i know what to do 
 john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal which put the finishing stroke to poor woe 
 is that all fling it out of the window and bother any more about it buy you quarts if you want it but for sake have hysterics for brought jack scott home to dinner and 
 john got no further for meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay 
 a man to dinner and everything in a mess john brooke how could you do such a thing 
 hush in the garden i forgot the confounded jelly but it be helped now said john surveying the prospect with an anxious eye 
 you ought to have sent word or told me this morning and you ought to have remembered how busy i was continued meg petulantly for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled 
 i know it this morning and there was no time to send word for i met him on the way out i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked i never tried it before and hang me if i ever do again added john with an aggrieved air 
 i should hope not take him away at once i see him and there any dinner 
 well i like that the beef and vegetables i sent home and the pudding you promised cried john rushing to the larder 
 i time to cook anything i meant to dine at sorry but i was so busy and tears began again 
 john was a mild man but he was human and after a long work to come home tired hungry and hopeful to find a chaotic house an empty table and a cross wife was not exactly conductive to repose of mind or manner he restrained himself however and the little squall would have blown over but for one unlucky word 
 a scrape i acknowledge but if you will lend a hand pull through and have a good time yet cry dear but just exert yourself a bit and fix us up something to eat both as hungry as hunters so we mind what it is give us the cold meat and bread and cheese we ask for jelly 
 he meant it to be a joke but that one word sealed his fate meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke 
 you must get yourself out of the scrape as you can too used up to exert myself for anyone like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company i have anything of the sort in my house take that scott up to and tell him away sick dead anything i see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like you have anything else here and having delivered her defiance all on one breath meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room 
 what those two creatures did in her absence she never knew but mr scott was not taken up to and when meg descended after they had strolled away together she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror lotty reported that they had eaten a much and greatly laughed and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff and hide the pots 
 meg longed to go and tell mother but a sense of shame at her own short comings of loyalty to john who might be cruel but nobody should know it restrained her and after a summary cleaning up she dressed herself prettily and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven 
 unfortunately john come not seeing the matter in that light he had carried it off as a good joke with scott excused his little wife as well as he could and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner and promised to come again but john was angry though he did not show it he felt that meg had deserted him in his hour of need it fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time with perfect freedom and when he took you at your word to flame up and blame him and leave him in the lurch to be laughed at or pitied no by george it and meg must know it 
 he had fumed inwardly during the feast but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing scott off a milder mood came over him poor little thing it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me she was wrong of course but then she was young i must be patient and teach her he hoped she had not gone hated gossip and interference for a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it and then the fear that meg would cry herself sick softened his heart and sent him on at a quicker pace resolving to be calm and kind but firm quite firm and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse 
 meg likewise resolved to be calm and kind but firm and show him his duty she longed to run to meet him and beg pardon and be kissed and comforted as she was sure of being but of course she did nothing of the sort and when she saw john coming began to hum quite naturally as she rocked and sewed like a lady of leisure in her best parlor 
 john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology he made none only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark we are going to have a new moon my dear 
 no objection was equally soothing remark a few other topics of general interest were introduced by mr brooke and by mrs brooke and conversation languished john went to one window unfolded his paper and wrapped himself in it figuratively speaking meg went to the other window and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life neither spoke both looked quite calm and firm and both felt desperately uncomfortable 
 oh dear thought meg married life is very trying and does need infinite patience as well as love as mother says the word mother suggested other maternal counsels given long ago and received with unbelieving protests 
 john is a good man but he has his faults and you must learn to see and bear with them remembering your own he is very decided but never will be obstinate if you reason kindly not oppose impatiently he is very accurate and particular about the good trait though you call him fussy never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need he has a temper not like flash and then all the white still anger that is seldom stirred but once kindled is hard to quench be careful be very careful not to wake his anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect watch yourself be the first to ask pardon if you both err and guard against the little piques misunderstandings and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret 
 
 these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last this was the first serious disagreement her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind as she recalled them her own anger looked childish now and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them she put down her work and got up thinking i will be the first to say forgive me but he did not seem to hear her she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head for a minute she felt as if she really do it then came the thought this is the beginning do my part and have nothing to reproach myself with and stooping sown she softly kissed her husband on the forehead of course that settled it the penitent kiss was better than a world of words and john had her on his knee in a minute saying tenderly 
 it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots forgive me dear i never will again 
 but he did oh bless you yes hundreds of times and so did meg both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made for family peace was preserved in that little family jar 
 after this meg had mr scott to dinner by special invitation and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course on which occasion she was so gay and gracious and made everything go off so charmingly that mr scott told john he was a lucky fellow and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home 
 in the autumn new trials and experiences came to meg sallie moffat renewed her friendship was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house or inviting that poor dear to come in and spend the day at the big house it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely all were busy at home john absent till night and nothing to do but sew or read or potter about so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend seeing pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them sallie was very kind and often offered her the coveted trifles but meg declined them knowing that john like it and then this foolish little woman went and did what john disliked even worse 
 she knew her income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value money she knew where it was was free to take what she liked and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny pay bills once a month and remember that she was a poor wife till now she had done well been prudent and exact kept her little account books neatly and showed them to him monthly without fear but that autumn the serpent got into paradise and tempted her like many a modern eve not with apples but with dress meg like to be pitied and made to feel poor it irritated her but she was ashamed to confess it and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty so that sallie think she had to economize she always felt wicked after it for the pretty things were seldom necessaries but then they cost so little it worth worrying about so the trifles increased unconsciously and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive 
 but the trifles cost more than one would imagine and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her john was busy that month and left the bills to her the next month he was absent but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up and meg never forgot it a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience sallie had been buying silks and meg longed for a new one just a handsome light one for parties her black silk was so common and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls aunt march usually gave the sisters a present of dollars apiece at new that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it john always said what was his was hers but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective but another out of the household fund that was the question sallie had urged her to do it had offered to lend the money and with the best intentions in life had tempted meg beyond her strength in an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely shimmering folds and said a bargain i assure you she answered take it and it was cut off and paid for and sallie had exulted and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence and driven away feeling as if she had stolen something and the police were after her 
 when she got home she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk but it looked less silvery now become her after all and the words fifty dollars seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth she put it away but it haunted her not delightfully as a new dress should but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid when john got out his books that night heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but mean to let her know it the house bills were all paid the books all in order john had praised her and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the bank when meg knowing that it was quite empty stopped his hand saying nervously 
 you seen my private expense book yet 
 john never asked to see it but she always insisted on his doing so and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted and made him guess what piping was demand fiercely the meaning of a or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds a bit of velvet and a pair of strings could possibly be a bonnet and cost six dollars that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance as he often did being particularly proud of his prudent wife 
 the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead and standing there she said with her panic increasing with every word 
 john dear ashamed to show you my book for really been dreadfully extravagant lately i go about so much i must have things you know and sallie advised my getting it so i did and my new money will partly pay for it but i was sorry after i had done it for i knew think it wrong in me 
 john laughed and drew her round beside him saying goodhumoredly go and hide i beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots rather proud of my feet and mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots if they are good ones 
 that had been one of her last trifles and eye had fallen on it as he spoke oh what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars thought meg with a shiver 
 worse than boots a silk dress she said with the calmness of desperation for she wanted the worst over 
 well dear what is the total as mr mantalini says 
 that sound like john and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now she turned the page and her head at the same time pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty but which was appalling to her with that added for a minute the room was very still then john said she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure 
 well i know that fifty is much for a dress with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days 
 it made or trimmed sighed meg faintly for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her 
 yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman but no doubt my wife will look as fine as ned when she gets it john dryly 
 i know you are angry john but i help it i mean to waste your money and i think those little things would count up so i resist them when i see sallie buying all she wants and pitying me because i i try to be contented but it is hard and tired of being poor 
 the last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them but he did and they wounded him deeply for he had denied himself many pleasures for sake she could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it for john pushed the books away and got up saying with a little quiver in his voice i was afraid of this i do my best meg if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words she ran to him and held him close crying with repentant tears oh john my dear kind boy i mean it it was so wicked so untrue and ungrateful how could i say it oh how could i say it he was very kind forgave her readily and did not utter one reproach but meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon although he might never allude to it again she had promised to love him for better or worse and then she his wife had reproached him with his poverty after spending his earnings recklessly it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep a week or remorse nearly made meg sick and the discovery that john had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold he had simply said in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change i afford it my dear 
 meg said no more but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat crying as if her heart would break 
 they had a long talk that night and meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty because it seemed to have made a man of him given him the strength and courage to fight his own way and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved 
 next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor the good natured mrs moffat willingly did so and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward then meg ordered home the greatcoat and when john arrived she put it on and asked him how he liked her new silk gown one can imagine what answer he made how he received his present and what a blissful state of things ensued john came home early meg gadded no more and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife so the year rolled round and at midsummer there came to meg a new experience the deepest and tenderest of a life 
 laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday with an excited face and was received with the clash of cymbals for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other 
 the little mamma where is everybody why you tell me before i came home began laurie in a loud whisper 
 happy as a queen the dear every soul of em is upstairs a worshipin we want no hurrycanes round now you go into the parlor and send em down to you with which somewhat involved reply hannah vanished chuckling ecstatically 
 presently jo appeared proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow face was very sober but her eyes twinkled and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort 
 shut your eyes and hold out your arms she said invitingly 
 laurie backed precipitately into a corner and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture no thank you rather not i shall drop it or smash it as sure as fate 
 then you see your nevvy said jo decidedly turning as if to go 
 i will i will only you must be responsible for damages and obeying orders laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms a peal of laughter from jo amy mrs march hannah and john caused him to open them the next minute to find himself invested with two babies instead of one 
 no wonder they laughed for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed 
 twins by jupiter was all he said for a minute then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous he added take em quick somebody going to laugh and i shall drop em 
 jo rescued his babies and marched up and down with one on each are as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending while laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks 
 the best joke of the season it i have told you for i set my heart on surprising you and i flatter myself done it said jo when she got her breath 
 i never was more staggered in my life it fun are they boys what are you going to name them have another look hold me up jo for upon my life one too many for me returned laurie regarding the infants with the air of a big benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens 
 boy and girl they beauties said the proud papa beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels 
 most remarkable children i ever saw which is which and laurie bent like a to examine the prodigies 
 amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl french fashion so you can always tell besides one has blue eyes and one brown kiss them uncle teddy said wicked jo 
 afraid they like it began laurie with unusual timidity in such matters 
 of course they will they are used to it now do it this minute sir commanded jo fearing he might propose a proxy 
 laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh and made the babies squeal 
 there i knew they like it the boy see him kick he hits out with his fists like a good one now then young brooke pitch into a man of your own size will you cried laurie delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist flapping aimlessly about

lionfish nov chapter the madness of mr crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ron and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy asking as sirius had suggested whether he had seen mr crouch lately they used hedwig because it had been so long since had a job when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socks 
 
 the gave them a very cheery welcome bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again dobby was ecstatic about his present 
 
 harry potter is too good to dobby he squeaked wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes 
 
 you saved my life with that gillyweed dobby you really did said harry 
 
 no chance of more of those eclairs is there said ron who was looking around at the beaming and bowing 
 
 just had breakfast said hermione irritably but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them supported by four elves 
 
 we should get some stuff to send up to snuffles harry muttered 
 
 good idea said ron give pig something to do you give us a bit of extra food could you he said to the surrounding elves and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more 
 
 dobby winky said hermione who was looking around 
 
 winky is over there by the fire miss said dobby quietly his ears drooping slightly 
 
 oh dear said hermione as she spotted winky 
 
 harry looked over at the fireplace too winky was sitting on the same stool as last time but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the brick behind her her clothes were ragged and unwashed she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool staring into the fire as they watched her she gave an enormous hiccup 
 
 winky is getting through six bottles a day now dobby whispered to harry 
 
 well not strong that stuff harry said 
 
 but dobby shook his head tis strong for a sir he said 
 
 winky hiccuped again the elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work 
 
 winky is pining harry potter dobby whispered sadly winky wants to go home winky still thinks mr crouch is her master sir and nothing dobby says will persuade her that professor dumbledore is her master now 
 
 hey winky said harry struck by a sudden inspiration walking over to her and bending down you know what mr crouch might be up to do you because stopped turning up to judge the triwizard tournament 
 
 eyes flickered her enormous pupils focused on harry she swayed slightly again and then said m master is stopped hic coming 
 
 yeah said harry we seen him since the first task the daily saying ill 
 
 winky swayed some more staring blurrily at harry 
 
 master hic ill 
 
 her bottom lip began to tremble 
 
 but not sure if true said hermione quickly 
 
 master is needing his hic winky whimpered the elf master cannot hic manage hic all by himself 
 
 other people manage to do their own housework you know winky hermione said severely 
 
 winky hic is not only hic doing housework for mr crouch winky squeaked indignantly swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse master is hic trusting winky with hic the most important hic the most secret 
 
 what said harry 
 
 but winky shook her head very hard spilling more butterbeer down herself 
 
 winky keeps hic her secrets she said mutinously swaying very heavily now frowning up at harry with her eyes crossed you is hic nosing you is 
 
 winky must not talk like that to harry potter said dobby angrily harry potter is brave and noble and harry potter is not nosy 
 
 he is nosing hic into my hic private and secret hic winky is a good hic winky keeps her silence hic people trying to hic pry and poke hic 
 
 eyelids drooped and suddenly without warning she slid off her stool into the hearth snoring loudly the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the floor half a dozen came hurrying forward looking disgusted one of them picked up the bottle the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly hiding her from view 
 
 we is sorry you had to see that sirs and miss squeaked a nearby elf shaking his head and looking very ashamed we is hoping you will not judge us all by winky sirs and miss 
 
 unhappy said hermione exasperated why you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up 
 
 begging your pardon miss said the bowing deeply again but has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served 
 
 oh for heavens sake hermione cried listen to me all of you got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes you have to do everything told look at dobby 
 
 miss will please keep dobby out of this dobby mumbled looking scared the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the around the kitchen they were suddenly looking at hermione as though she were mad and dangerous 
 
 we has your extra food squeaked an elf at elbow and he shoved a large ham a dozen cakes and some fruit into arms 
 
 the crowded around harry ron and hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs 
 
 thank you for the socks harry potter dobby called miserably from the hearth where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winky 
 
 you keep your mouth shut could you hermione said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them they want us visiting them now we tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouch 
 
 oh as if you care about that scoffed hermione you only like coming down here for the food 
 
 it was an irritable sort of day after that harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took food up to the owlery that evening on his own 
 
 pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well when they had set off into the dusk looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them harry leaned on the windowsill looking out at the grounds at the dark rustling treetops of the forbidden forest and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from chimney it soared toward the castle around the owlery and out of sight looking down harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin harry wondered what he was doing it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch as he watched madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation hagrid leaned upon his spade but did not seem keen to prolong their talk because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward 
 
 unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake swooshing past him into the night 
 
 
 
 by breakfast the next day and bad moods had burnt out and to relief dark predictions that the would send substandard food up to the gryffindor table because hermione had insulted them proved false the bacon eggs and kippers were quite as good as usual 
 
 when the post owls arrived hermione looked up eagerly she seemed to be expecting something 
 
 percy had time to answer yet said ron we only sent hedwig yesterday 
 
 no not that said hermione taken out a subscription to the daily prophet getting sick of finding everything out from the slytherins 
 
 good thinking said harry also looking up at the owls hey hermione i think in luck 
 
 a gray owl was soaring down toward hermione 
 
 it got a newspaper though she said looking disappointed 
 
 but to her bewilderment the gray owl landed in front of her plate closely followed by four barn owls a brown owl and a tawny 
 
 how many subscriptions did you take out said harry seizing goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their own letter first 
 
 what on earth hermione said taking the letter from the gray owl opening it and starting to read oh really she sputtered going rather red 
 
 up said ron 
 
 oh how ridiculous 
 
 she thrust the letter at harry who saw that it was not handwritten but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the daily prophet 
 
 you are a wicked girl harry potter deserves 
 better go back where you came from muggle 
 all like it said hermione desperately opening one letter after another harry potter can do much better than the likes of you you deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ouch 
 
 she had opened the last envelope and liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands which began to erupt in large yellow boils 
 
 undiluted bubotuber pus said ron picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it 
 
 ow said hermione tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick knobbly gloves 
 
 better get up to the hospital wing said harry as the owls around hermione took flight tell professor sprout where gone 
 
 i warned her said ron as hermione hurried out of the great hall cradling her hands i warned her not to annoy rita skeeter look at this one he read out one of the letters hermione had left behind i read in witch weekly about how you are playing harry potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope blimey better watch out for herself 
 
 hermione turn up for herbology as harry and ron left the greenhouse for their care of magical creatures class they saw malfoy crabbe and goyle descending the stone steps of the castle pansy parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of slytherin girls catching sight of harry pansy called potter have you split up with your girlfriend why was she so upset at breakfast 
 
 harry ignored her he want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had caused 
 
 hagrid who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet heart sank at the sight of the crates surely not another skrewt hatching but when he got near enough to see inside he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts their front paws were curiously flat like spades and they were blinking up at the class looking politely puzzled at all the attention 
 
 nifflers said hagrid when the class had gathered around yeh find em down mines mostly they like sparkly yeh go look 
 
 one of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy watch off her wrist she shrieked and jumped backward 
 
 useful little treasure detectors said hagrid happily thought have some fun with em today see over there he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth harry had watched him digging from the owlery window buried some gold coins got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most jus take off all yer valuables an choose a niffler an get ready ter set em loose 
 
 harry took off his watch which he was only wearing out of habit as it work anymore and stuffed it into his pocket then he picked up a niffler it put its long snout in ear and sniffed enthusiastically it was really quite cuddly 
 
 hang on said hagrid looking down into the crate a spare niffler missin hermione 
 
 she had to go to the hospital wing said ron 
 
 explain later harry muttered pansy parkinson was listening 
 
 it was easily the most fun they had ever had in care of magical creatures the nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands was particularly efficient it had soon filled his lap with coins 
 
 can you buy these as pets hagrid he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil splattering his robes 
 
 yer mum wouldn be happy ron said hagrid grinning they wreck houses nifflers i reckon nearly got the lot now he added pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive i buried a hundred coins oh there hermione 
 
 hermione was walking toward them across the lawn her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable pansy parkinson was watching her beadily 
 
 well check how done said hagrid count yer coins an no point tryin ter steal any goyle he added his eyes narrowed leprechaun gold vanishes after a few hours 
 
 goyle emptied his pockets looking extremely sulky it turned out that niffler had been most successful so hagrid gave him an enormous slab of chocolate for a prize the bell rang across the grounds for lunch the rest of the class set off back to the castle but harry ron and hermione stayed behind to help hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes harry noticed madame maxime watching them out other carriage window 
 
 what yeh done ter your hands hermione said hagrid looking concerned 
 
 hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning and the envelope full of bubotuber pus 
 
 aaah don worry said hagrid gently looking down at her i got some o those letters an all after rita skeeter wrote abou me mum a monster an yeh should be put down yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake 
 
 no said hermione looking shocked 
 
 yeah said hagrid heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall jus nutters hermione don open em if yeh get any more chuck em straigh in the fire 
 
 you missed a really good lesson harry told hermione as they headed back toward the castle good nifflers they ron 
 
 ron however was frowning at the chocolate hagrid had given him he looked thoroughly put out about something 
 
 the matter said harry wrong flavor 
 
 no said ron shortly why you tell me about the gold 
 
 what gold said harry 
 
 the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup said ron the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars in the top box why you tell me it disappeared 
 
 harry had to think for a moment before he realized what ron was talking about 
 
 oh he said the memory coming back to him at last i dunnoi never noticed it had gone i was more worried about my wand i 
 
 they climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunch 
 
 must be nice ron said abruptly when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and yorkshire puddings to have so much money you notice if a pocketful of galleons goes missing 
 
 listen i had other stuff on my mind that night said harry impatiently we all did remember 
 
 i know leprechaun gold vanishes ron muttered i thought i was paying you back you given me that chudley cannon hat for christmas 
 
 forget it all right said harry 
 
 ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork glaring at it then he said i hate being poor 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other neither of them really knew what to say 
 
 rubbish said ron still glaring down at his potato i blame fred and george for trying to make some extra money wish i could wish i had a niffler 
 
 well we know what to get you next christmas said hermione brightly then when ron continued to look gloomy she said come on ron it could be worse at least your fingers full of pus hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork her fingers were so stiff and swollen i hate that skeeter woman she burst out savagely get her back for this if the last thing i do 
 
 
 
 hate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week and although she followed advice and stopped opening it several of her sent howlers which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear even those people who read witch weekly knew all about the supposed triangle now harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione his girlfriend 
 
 die down though he told hermione if we just ignore got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time 
 
 i want to know how listening into private conversations when supposed to be banned from the grounds said hermione angrily 
 
 hermione hung back in their next defense against the dark arts lesson to ask professor moody something the rest of the class was very eager to leave moody had given them such a rigorous test of that many of them were nursing small injuries harry had such a bad case of twitchy ears he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class 
 
 well definitely not using an invisibility cloak hermione panted five minutes later catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her moody says he see her anywhere near the judges table at the second task or anywhere near the lake 
 
 hermione is there any point in telling you to drop this said ron 
 
 no said hermione stubbornly i want to know how she heard me talking to viktor and how she found out about mum 
 
 maybe she had you bugged said harry 
 
 bugged said ron blankly whatput fleas on her or something 
 
 harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment ron was fascinated but hermione interrupted them 
 
 you two ever going to read hogwarts a history 
 
 the point said ron you know it by heart we can just ask you 
 
 all those substitutes for magic muggles use electricity computers and radar and all those things they all go haywire around hogwarts too much magic in the air no using magic to eavesdrop she must i could just find out what it isooh if illegal have her 
 
 we got enough to worry about ron asked her do we have to start a vendetta against rita skeeter as well 
 
 not asking you to help hermione snapped do it on my own 
 
 she marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance harry was quite sure she was going to the library 
 
 the betting she comes back with a box of hate rita skeeter badges said ron 
 
 hermione however did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter for which they were both grateful because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do he was working just to get through all their homework though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius after last summer harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry he enclosed notes to sirius telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened and that they were still waiting for an answer from percy 
 
 hedwig return until the end of the easter holidays letter was enclosed in a package of easter eggs that mrs weasley had sent both and were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee however was smaller than a chicken egg her face fell when she saw it 
 
 your mum read witch weekly by any chance does she ron she asked quietly 
 
 yeah said ron whose mouth was full of toffee gets it for the recipes 
 
 hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg 
 
 you want to see what written harry asked her hastily 
 
 letter was short and irritated 
 
 as i am constantly telling the daily prophet mr crouch is taking a break he is sending in regular owls with instructions no i actually seen him but i think i can be trusted to know my own handwriting i have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors please bother me again unless something important happy easter 
 the start of the summer term would normally have meant that harry was training hard for the last quidditch match of the season this year however it was the third and final task in the triwizard tournament for which he needed to prepare but he still know what he would have to do finally in the last week of may professor mcgonagall held him back in transfiguration 
 
 you are to go down to the quidditch field tonight at nine potter she told him mr bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task 
 
 so at half past eight that night harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs as he crossed the entrance hall cedric came up from the hufflepuff common room 
 
 what reckon going to be he asked harry as they went together down the stone steps out into the cloudy night fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels she reckons got to find treasure 
 
 that be too bad said harry thinking that he would simply ask hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him 
 
 they walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium turned through a gap in the stands and walked out onto the field 
 
 they done to it cedric said indignantly stopping dead 
 
 the quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat it looked as though somebody had been building long low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction 
 
 hedges said harry bending to examine the nearest one 
 
 hello there called a cheery voice 
 
 ludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with krum and fleur harry and cedric made their way toward them climbing over the hedges fleur beamed at harry as he came nearer her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake 
 
 well what think said bagman happily as harry and cedric climbed over the last hedge growing nicely they give them a month and have them twenty feet high worry he added grinning spotting the expressions on and faces have your quidditch field back to normal once the task is over now i imagine you can guess what making here 
 
 no one spoke for a moment then 
 
 maze grunted krum 
 
 right said bagman a maze the third really very straightforward the triwizard cup will be placed in the center of the maze the first champion to touch it will receive full marks 
 
 we seemply ave to get through the maze said fleur 
 
 there will be obstacles said bagman happily bouncing on the balls of his feet hagrid is providing a number of creaturesthen there will be spells that must be brokenall that sort of thing you know now the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze bagman grinned at harry and cedric then mr krum will enterthen miss delacour but all be in with a fighting chance depending how well you get past the obstacles should be fun eh 
 
 harry who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all however he nodded politely like the other champions 
 
 very wellif you got any questions go back up to the castle shall we a bit chilly 
 
 bagman hurried alongside harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze harry had the feeling that bagman was going to start offering to help him again but just then krum tapped harry on the shoulder 
 
 could i haff a vord 
 
 yeah all right said harry slightly surprised 
 
 vill you valk vith me 
 
 okay said harry curiously 
 
 bagman looked slightly perturbed 
 
 wait for you harry shall i 
 
 no okay mr bagman said harry suppressing a smile i think i can find the castle on my own thanks 
 
 harry and krum left the stadium together but krum did not set a course for the durmstrang ship instead he walked toward the forest 
 
 we going this way for said harry as they passed cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage 
 
 vont to be overheard said krum shortly 
 
 when at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the beauxbatons horses paddock krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face harry 
 
 i vant to know he said glowering vot there is between you and 
 
 harry who from secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this stared up at krum in amazement 
 
 nothing he said but krum glowered at him and harry somehow struck anew by how tall krum was elaborated friends not my girlfriend and she never has been just that skeeter woman making things up 
 
 talks about you very often said krum looking suspiciously at harry 
 
 yeah said harry because were friends 
 
 he quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum the famous international quidditch player it was as though the krum thought he harry was an equal a real rival 
 
 you haff neveryou haff not 
 
 no said harry very firmly 
 
 krum looked slightly happier he stared at harry for a few seconds then said you fly very veil i vos votching at the first task 
 
 thanks said harry grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself i saw you at the quidditch world cup the wronski feint you really 
 
 but something moved behind krum in the trees and harry who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest instinctively grabbed arm and pulled him around 
 
 vot is it 
 
 harry shook his head staring at the place where seen movement he slipped his hand inside his robes reaching for his wand 
 
 suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak for a moment harry recognize himthen he realized it was mr crouch 
 
 he looked as though he had been traveling for days the knees of his robes were ripped and bloody his face scratched he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion his neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim his strange appearance however was nothing to the way he was behaving muttering and gesticulating mr crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see he reminded harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the dursleys that man too had been conversing wildly with thin air aunt petunia had seized hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him uncle vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants 
 
 he a judge said krum staring at mr crouch he vith your ministry 
 
 harry nodded hesitated for a moment then walked slowly toward mr crouch who did not look at him but continued to talk to a nearby tree 
 
 and when done that weatherby send an owl to dumbledore confirming the number of durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve 
 
 mr crouch said harry cautiously 
 
 and then send another owl to madame maxime because she might want to up the number of students bringing now made it a round dozendo that weatherby will you will you will 
 
 mr eyes were bulging he stood staring at the tree muttering soundlessly at it then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees 
 
 mr crouch harry said loudly are you all right 
 
 eyes were rolling in his head harry looked around at krum who had followed him into the trees and was looking down at crouch in alarm 
 
 vot is wrong with him 
 
 no idea harry muttered listen better go and get someone 
 
 dumbledore gasped mr crouch he reached out and seized a handful of robes dragging him closer though his eyes were staring over head i needseedumbledore 
 
 okay said harry if you get up mr crouch we can go up to the 
 
 donestupidthing mr crouch breathed he looked utterly mad his eyes were rolling and bulging and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort musttelldumbledore 
 
 get up mr crouch said harry loudly and clearly get up take you to dumbledore 
 
 mr eyes rolled forward onto harry 
 
 whoyou he whispered 
 
 a student at the school said harry looking around at krum for some help but krum was hanging back looking extremely nervous 
 
 nothis whispered crouch his mouth sagging 
 
 no said harry without the faintest idea what crouch was talking about 
 
 
 
 right said harry 
 
 crouch was pulling him closer harry tried to loosen grip on his robes but it was too powerful 
 
 warndumbledore 
 
 get dumbledore if you let go of me said harry just let go mr crouch and get him 
 
 thank you weatherby and when you have done that i would like a cup of tea my wife and son will be arriving shortly we are attending a concert tonight with mr and mrs fudge 
 
 crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again and seemed completely unaware that harry was there which surprised harry so much he notice that crouch had released him 
 
 yes my son has recently gained twelve most satisfactory yes thank you yes very proud indeed now if you could bring me that memo from the andorran minister of magic i think i will have time to draft a response 
 
 you stay here with him harry said to krum get dumbledore be quicker i know where his office is 
 
 he is mad said krum doubtfully staring down at crouch who was still gabbling to the tree apparently convinced it was percy 
 
 just stay with him said harry starting to get up but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in mr crouch who seized him hard around the knees and pulled harry back to the ground 
 
 he whispered his eyes bulging again iescapedmust warnmust tellsee dumbledoremy faultall my faultberthadeadall my faultmy sonmy faulttell dumbledore harry potterthe dark lordstrongerharry potter 
 
 get dumbledore if you let me go mr crouch said harry he looked furiously around at krum help me will you 
 
 looking extremely apprehensive krum moved forward and squatted down next to mr crouch 
 
 just keep him here said harry pulling himself free of mr crouch be back with dumbledore 
 
 hurry you krum called after him as harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds they were deserted bagman cedric and fleur had disappeared harry tore up the stone steps through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase toward the second floor 
 
 five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor 
 
 sher sherbet lemon he panted at it 
 
 this was the password to the hidden staircase to office or at least it had been two years ago the password had evidently changed however for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside but stood frozen glaring at harry malevolently 
 
 move harry shouted at it 
 
 but nothing at hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it he knew it was no good he looked up and down the dark corridor perhaps dumbledore was in the staffroom he started running as fast as he could toward the staircase 
 
 potter 
 
 harry skidded to a halt and looked around snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle the wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned harry back toward him 
 
 what are you doing here potter 
 
 i need to see professor dumbledore said harry running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of snape instead mr just turned in the asking 
 
 what is this rubbish said snape his black eyes glittering what are you talking about 
 
 mr crouch harry shouted from the ministry ill or something in the forest he wants to see dumbledore just give me the password up to 
 
 the headmaster is busy potter said snape his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile 
 
 got to tell dumbledore harry yelled 
 
 you hear me potter 
 
 harry could tell snape was thoroughly enjoying himself denying harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky 
 
 look said harry angrily crouch right out of his mind he says he wants to warn 
 
 the stone wall behind snape slid open dumbledore was standing there wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression is there a problem he said looking between harry and snape 
 
 professor harry said sidestepping snape before snape could speak mr crouch is here down in the forest he wants to speak to you 
 
 harry expected dumbledore to ask questions but to his relief dumbledore did nothing of the sort 
 
 lead the way he said promptly and he swept off along the corridor behind harry leaving snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly 
 
 what did mr crouch say harry said dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase 
 
 said he wants to warn yousaid done something terriblehe mentioned his sonand bertha jorkinsand and voldemortsomething about voldemort getting stronger 
 
 indeed said dumbledore and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the 
 
 not acting normally harry said hurrying along beside dumbledore he seem to know where he is he keeps talking like he thinks percy there and then he changes and says he needs to see left him with viktor krum 
 
 you did said dumbledore sharply and he began to take longer strides still so that harry was running to keep up do you know if anybody else saw mr crouch 
 
 no said harry krum and i were talking mr bagman had just finished telling us about the third task we stayed behind and then we saw mr crouch coming out of the forest 
 
 where are they said dumbledore as the beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness 
 
 over here said harry moving in front of dumbledore leading the way through the trees he hear voice anymore but he knew where he was going it been much past the beauxbatons carriagesomewhere around here 
 
 viktor harry shouted 
 
 no one answered 
 
 they were here harry said to dumbledore they were definitely somewhere around here 
 
 lumos dumbledore said lighting his wand and holding it up 
 
 its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk illuminating the ground and then it fell upon a pair of feet 
 
 harry and dumbledore hurried forward krum was sprawled on the forest floor he seemed to be unconscious there was no sign at all of mr crouch dumbledore bent over krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids 
 
 stunned he said softly his glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees 
 
 should i go and get someone said harry madam pomfrey 
 
 no said dumbledore swiftly stay here 
 
 he raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of cabin harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird then dumbledore bent over krum again pointed his wand at him and muttered ennervate 
 
 krum opened his eyes he looked dazed when he saw dumbledore he tried to sit up but dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still 
 
 he attacked me krum muttered putting a hand up to his head the old madman attacked me i vos looking around to see vare potter had gone and he attacked from behind 
 
 lie still for a moment dumbledore said 
 
 the sound of thunderous footfalls reached them and hagrid came panting into sight with fang at his heels he was carrying his crossbow 
 
 professor dumbledore he said his eyes widening harry what the 
 
 hagrid i need you to fetch professor karkaroff said dumbledore his student has been attacked when done that kindly alert professor moody 
 
 no need dumbledore said a wheezy growl here 
 
 moody was limping toward them leaning on his staff his wand lit 
 
 damn leg he said furiously been here happened snape said something about crouch 
 
 crouch said hagrid blankly 
 
 karkaroff please hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 oh yeahright professor said hagrid and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees fang trotting after him 
 
 i know where barty crouch is dumbledore told moody but it is essential that we find him 
 
 onto it growled moody and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of hagrid and fang returning karkaroff was hurrying along behind them he was wearing his sleek silver furs and he looked pale and agitated 
 
 what is this he cried when he saw krum on the ground and dumbledore and harry beside him going on 
 
 i vos attacked said krum sitting up now and rubbing his head mr crouch or votever his name 
 
 crouch attacked you crouch attacked you the triwizard judge 
 
 igor dumbledore began but karkaroff had drawn himself up clutching his furs around him looking livid 
 
 treachery he bellowed pointing at dumbledore it is a plot you and your ministry of magic have lured me here under false pretenses dumbledore this is not an equal competition first you sneak potter into the tournament though he is underage now one of your ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action i smell and corruption in this whole affair and you dumbledore you with your talk of closer international wizarding links of rebuilding old ties of forgetting old differences what i think of you 
 
 karkaroff spat onto the ground at feet in one swift movement hagrid seized the front of furs lifted him into the air and slammed him against a nearby tree 
 
 apologize hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for breath massive fist at his throat his feet dangling in midair 
 
 hagrid no dumbledore shouted his eyes flashing 
 
 hagrid removed the hand pinning karkaroff to the tree and karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head 
 
 kindly escort harry back up to the castle hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 breathing heavily hagrid gave karkaroff a glowering look 
 
 maybe better stay here headmaster 
 
 you will take harry back to school hagrid dumbledore repeated firmly take him right up to gryffindor tower and harry i want you to stay there anything you might want to do any owls you might want to send they can wait until morning do you understand me 
 
 er yes said harry staring at him how had dumbledore known that at that very moment he had been thinking about sending pigwidgeon straight to sirius to tell him what had happened 
 
 leave fang with yeh headmaster hagrid said staring menacingly at karkaroff who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree tangled in furs and tree roots stay fang harry 
 
 they marched in silence past the beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle 
 
 how dare he hagrid growled as they strode past the lake how dare he accuse dumbledore like do anythin like that like dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs place worried i dunno when i seen dumbledore more worried than bin lately an you hagrid suddenly said angrily to harry who looked up at him taken aback what were yeh doin wanderin off with ruddy krum from durmstrang harry coulda jinxed yeh right there couldn he hasn moody taught yeh nothin magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own 
 
 all right said harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall he trying to jinx me he just wanted to talk about hermione 
 
 be havin a few words with her an all said hagrid grimly stomping up the stairs the less you lot ave ter do with these foreigners the happier be yeh can trust any of em 
 
 you were getting on all right with madame maxime harry said annoyed 
 
 don you talk ter me abou her said hagrid and he looked quite frightening for a moment got her number now tryin ter get back in me good books tryin ter get me ter tell her comin in the third task ha you can trust any 
 
 hagrid was in such a bad mood harry was quite glad to say to him in front of the fat lady he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting to tell them what had happened 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter worst memorycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by order of the ministry of magic 
 
 
 
 dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor has replaced 
 
 albus dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of 
 
 witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic 
 
 the notices had gone up all around the school overnight but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that dumbledore had overcome two aurors the high inquisitor the minister for magic and his junior assistant to escape no matter where harry went within the castle the sole topic of conversation was flight and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling harry overheard one girl assuring another that fudge was now lying in st with a pumpkin for a head it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was everybody knew for instance that harry and marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in office and as marietta was now in the hospital wing harry found himself besieged with requests to give a account 
 
 dumbledore will be back before long said ernie macmillan confidently on the way back from herbology after listening intently to story they keep him away in our second year and they be able to this time the fat friar told me he dropped his voice conspiratorially so that harry ron and hermione had to lean closer to him to hear that umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after searched the castle and grounds for him get past the gargoyle the office has sealed itself against her ernie smirked apparently she had a right little tantrum 
 
 oh i expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the office said hermione viciously as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall lording it over all the other teachers the stupid old 
 
 now do you really want to finish that sentence granger 
 
 draco malfoy had slid out from behind the door closely followed by crabbe and goyle his pale pointed face was alight w th malice 
 
 afraid going to have to dock a few points from gryffincor and hufflepuff he drawled 
 
 only teachers who can dock points from houses malfoy said ernie at once 
 
 yeah prefects too remember snarled ron 
 
 i know prefects dock points weasel king sneered maltby crabbe and goyle sniggered but members of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 the what said hermione sharply 
 
 the inquisitorial squad granger said malfoy pointing towards a tiny silver i on his robes just beneath his badge a select group of students who are supportive of the ministry of magic by professor umbridge anyway members of the inquisitorial squad do have the power to dock points so granger have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress macmillan five for contradicting me five because i like you potter weasley your untucked so have another five for that oh yeah i forgot a mudblood granger so ten off for that 
 
 ron pulled out his wand but hermione pushed it away whispering 
 
 wise move granger breathed malfoy new head new times be good now potty weasel king 
 
 laughing heartily he strode away with crabbe and goyle 
 
 he was bluffing said ernie looking appalled he be allowed to dock points that would be ridiculous it would completely undermine the prefect system 
 
 but harry ron and hermione had turned automatically towards the giant set in niches along the wall behind them which recorded the gryffindor and ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning even as they watched stones flew upwards reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs in fact the only glass that seemed unchanged was the one of slytherin 
 
 noticed have you said voice 
 
 he and george had just come down the marble staircase and joined harry ron hermione and ernie in front of the 
 
 malfoy just docked us all about fifty points said harry furiously as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the gryffindor 
 
 yeah montague tried to do us during break said george 
 
 what do you mean tried said ron quickly 
 
 he never managed to get all the words out said fred due to the fact that we forced him into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor 
 
 hermione looked very shocked 
 
 but get into terrible trouble 
 
 not until montague reappears and that could take weeks i dunno where we sent him said fred coolly anyway decided we care about getting into trouble any more 
 
 have you ever asked hermione 
 
 course we have said george never been expelled have we 
 
 always known where to draw the line said fred 
 
 we might have put a toe across it occasionally said george 
 
 but always stopped short of causing real mayhem said fred 
 
 but now said ron tentatively 
 
 well now said george 
 
 what with dumbledore gone said fred 
 
 we reckon a bit of mayhem said george 
 
 is exactly what our dear new head deserves said fred 
 
 you whispered hermione you really love a reason to expel you 
 
 you get it hermione do you said fred smiling at her we care about staying any more walk out right now if we determined to do our bit for dumbledore first so anyway he checked his watch phase one is about to begin get in the great hall for lunch if i were you that way the teachers will see you have had anything to do with it 
 
 anything to do with what said hermione anxiously 
 
 see said george run along now 
 
 fred and george turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch looking highly disconcerted ernie muttered something about unfinished transfiguration homework and scurried away 
 
 i think we should get out of here you know said hermione nervously just in case 
 
 yeah all right said ron and the three of them moved towards the doors to the great hall but harry had barely glimpsed the ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he found himself almost with filch the caretaker he took several hasty steps backwards filch was best viewed at a distance 
 
 the headmistress would like to see you potter he leered 
 
 i do it said harry stupidly thinking of whatever fred and george were planning jowls wobbled with silent laughter 
 
 guilty conscience eh he wheezed follow me 
 
 harry glanced back at ron and hermione who were both looking worried he shrugged and followed filch back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry students 
 
 filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase as they reached the first landing he said things are changing around here potter 
 
 noticed said harry coldly 
 
 yerse been telling dumbledore for years and years too soft with you all said filch chuckling nastily you filthy little beasts would never have dropped stink pellets if known i had it in my power to whip you raw would you now nobody would have thought of throwing fanged frisbees down the corridors if i strung you up by the ankles in my office would they but when educational decree number comes in potter be allowed to do them things and asked the minister to sign an order for the expulsion of peeves oh things are going to be very different around here with her in charge 
 
 umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get filch on her side harry thought and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon his knowledge of the secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the weasley twins 
 
 here we are he said leering down at harry as he rapped three times on professor door and pushed it open the potter boy to see you 
 
 office so very familiar to harry from his many detentions was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word headmistress also his firebolt and fred and cleansweeps which he saw with a pang were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk 
 
 umbridge was sitting behind the desk busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance 
 
 thank you argus she said sweetly 
 
 not at all not at all said filch bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit and exiting backwards 
 
 sit said umbridge curtly pointing towards a chair harry sat she continued to scribble for a few moments he watched some of the foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him 
 
 well now she said finally setting down her quill and surveying him complacently like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly what would you like to drink 
 
 what said harry quite sure he had misheard her 
 
 to drink mr potter she said smiling still more widely tea coffee pumpkin juice 
 
 as she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk 
 
 nothing thank you said harry 
 
 i wish you to have a drink with me she said her voice becoming dangerously sweet choose one 
 
 fine tea then said harry shrugging 
 
 she got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him she then bustled around the desk with it smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion 
 
 there she said handing it to him drink it before it gets cold you well now mr potter i thought we ought to have a little chat after the distressing events of last night 
 
 he said nothing she settled herself back into her seat and waited when several long moments had passed in silence she said gaily not drinking up 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips and then just as suddenly lowered it one of the horrible painted kittens behind umbridge had great round blue eyes just like magical one and it had just occurred to harry what would say if he ever heard that harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy 
 
 the matter said umbridge who was still watching him closely do you want sugar 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed smile widened 
 
 good she whispered very good now then she leaned forwards a little where is albus dumbledore 
 
 no idea said harry promptly 
 
 drink up drink up she said still smiling now mr potter let us not play childish games i know that you know where he has gone you and dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning consider your position mr potter 
 
 i know where he is harry repeated 
 
 he pretended to drink again she was watching him very closely 
 
 very well she said though she looked displeased in that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of sirius black 
 
 stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer he tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes 
 
 i know he said a little too quickly 
 
 mr potter said umbridge let me remind you that it was i who almost caught the criminal black in the gryffindor fire in october i know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today i promise you i repeat mr potter where is sirius black 
 
 no idea said harry loudly got a clue 
 
 they stared at each other so long that harry felt his eyes watering then umbridge stood up 
 
 very well potter i will take your word for it this time but be warned the might of the ministry stands behind me all channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored a floo network regulator is keeping watch over every fire in hogwartsexcept my own of course my inquisitorial squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle and mr filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle if i find a shred of evidence 
 
 boom 
 
 the very floor of the office shook umbridge slipped sideways clutching her desk for support and looking shocked 
 
 what was 
 
 she was gazing towards the door harry took the opportunity to empty his cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers he could hear people running and screaming several floors below 
 
 back to lunch you go potter cried umbridge raising her wand and dashing out of the office harry gave her a few seconds start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was 
 
 it was not difficult to find one floor down pandemonium reigned somebody and harry had a very shrewd idea who had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks 
 
 dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere harry looked and instead of burning themselves out fading from sight or fizzling to a halt these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched 
 
 filch and umbridge were standing apparently transfixed in horror halfway down the stairs as harry watched one of the larger catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre it whirled towards umbridge and filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee they both yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds meanwhile several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor 
 
 hurry filch hurry shrieked umbridge be all over the school unless we do somethingstupefy 
 
 a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets instead of freezing in midair it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a witch in the middle of a meadow she ran for it just in time reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her 
 
 stun them filch shouted umbridge angrily for all the world as though it had been his incantation 
 
 right you are headmistress wheezed filch who as a squib could no more have stunned the fireworks than swallowed them he dashed to a nearby cupboard pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze 
 
 harry had seen enough laughing he ducked down low ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find fred and george hiding just behind it listening to umbridge and yells and quaking with suppressed mirth 
 
 impressive harry said quietly grinning very impressive put dr filibuster out of business no problem 
 
 cheers whispered george wiping tears of laughter from his face oh i hope she tries vanishing them next they multiply by ten every time you try 
 
 the fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon though they caused plenty of disruption particularly the firecrackers the other teachers seem to mind them very much 
 
 dear dear said professor mcgonagall sardonically as one of the dragons soared around her classroom emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame miss brown would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom 
 
 the upshot of it all was that professor umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her when the final bell rang and they were heading back to gryffindor tower with their bags harry saw with immense satisfaction a dishevelled and umbridge tottering from professor classroom 
 
 thank you so much professor said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice i could have got rid of the sparklers myself of course but i sure whether or not i had the authority 
 
 beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face 
 
 fred and george were heroes that night in the gryffindor common room even hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them 
 
 they were wonderful fireworks she said admiringly 
 
 thanks said george looking both surprised and pleased weasleys wildfire only thing is we used our whole stock going to have to start again from scratch now 
 
 it was worth it though said fred who was taking orders from clamouring gryffindors if you want to add your name to the waiting list hermione five galleons for your basic blaze box and twenty for the deflagration deluxe 
 
 hermione returned to the table where harry and ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself 
 
 oh why we have a night off said hermione brightly as a weasley rocket zoomed past the window after all the easter holidays start on friday have plenty of time then 
 
 are you feeling all right ron asked staring at her in disbelief 
 
 now you mention it said hermione happily know i think feeling a bit rebellious 
 
 harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and ron went up to bed an hour later and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word poo 
 
 he got into bed yawning with his glasses off the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred looking like sparkling clouds beautiful and mysterious against the black sky he turned on to his side wondering how umbridge was feeling about her first day in job and how fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption smiling to himself harry closed his eyes 
 
 the whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them 
 
 he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mysteries he was speeding towards the plain black door let it open let it open 
 
 it did he was inside the circular room lined with doors he crossed it placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards 
 
 now he was in a long rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking there were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate he had to go on 
 
 there was a door at the far end it too opened at his touch 
 
 and now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves each laden with small dusty spheres now heart was beating fast with excitement he knew where to go he ran forwards but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous deserted room 
 
 there was something in this room he wanted very very much 
 
 something he wanted or somebody else wanted 
 
 his scar was hurting 
 
 bang 
 
 harry awoke instantly confused and angry the dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter 
 
 cool said seamus who was silhouetted against the window i think one of those catherine wheels hit a rocket and like they mated come and see 
 
 harry heard ron and dean scramble out of bed for a better look he lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him he felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment he had got so close that time 
 
 glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of gryffindor tower harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of gryffindors in the dormitories below them his stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening 
 
 harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the department of mysteries harry had penetrated during his last dream with a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised occlumency once since their last lesson there had been too much going on since dumbledore had left he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried he doubted however whether snape would accept that excuse 
 
 he attempted a little practice during classes that day but it was no good hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and after all the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class 
 
 resigned to the worst he set off for office after dinner halfway across the entrance hall however cho came hurrying up to him 
 
 over here said harry glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant stood was now almost empty are you ok umbridge been asking you about the da has she 
 
 oh no said cho hurriedly no it was only well i just wanted to say harry i never dreamed marietta would tell 
 
 yeah well said harry moodily he did feel cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully it was small consolation that the last he had heard marietta was still up in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples 
 
 a lovely person really said cho she just made a mistake 
 
 harry looked at her incredulously 
 
 a lovely person who made a sold us all out including you 
 
 well we all got away we said cho pleadingly you know her mum works for the ministry really difficult for her 
 
 dad works for the ministry too harry said furiously and in case you noticed he got sneak written across his face 
 
 that was a really horrible trick of hermione said cho fiercely she should have told us jinxed that list 
 
 i think it was a brilliant idea said harry coldly cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter 
 
 oh yes i forgot of course if it was darling hermiones idea 
 
 start crying again said harry warningly 
 
 i going to she shouted 
 
 yeah well good he said got enough to cope with at the moment 
 
 go and cope with it then cho said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off 
 
 fuming harry descended the stairs to dungeon and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to cho about marietta before reaching the dungeon door 
 
 late potter said snape coldly as harry closed the door behind him 
 
 snape was standing with his back to harry removing as usual certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in pensieve he dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face harry 
 
 so he said have you been practising 
 
 yes harry lied looking carefully at one of the legs of desk 
 
 well soon find out we said snape smoothly wand out potter 
 
 harry moved into his usual position facing snape with the desk between them his heart was pumping last with anger at cho and anxiety about how much snape was about to extract from his mind 
 
 on the count of three then said snape lazily onetwo 
 
 office door banged open and draco malfoy sped in 
 
 professor snape sirohsorry 
 
 malfoy was looking at snape and harry in some surprise 
 
 all right draco said snape lowering his wand potter is here for a little remedial potions 
 
 harry had not seen malfoy look so gleeful since umbridge had turned up to inspect hagrid 
 
 i know he said leering at harry who knew his face was burning he would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at malfoyor even better to hit him with a good curse 
 
 well draco what is it asked snape 
 
 professor umbridge sirshe needs your help said malfoy 
 
 found montague sir turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor 
 
 how did he get in there demanded snape 
 
 i know sir a bit confused 
 
 very well very well potter said snape we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening 
 
 he turned and swept from his office malfoy mouthed remedial potions at harry behind back before following him 
 
 seething harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room at least he had more hours in which to practise he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape though it was hard that it came at the expense of malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial potions 
 
 he was at the office door when he saw it a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe he stopped and stood looking at it reminded of something then he remembered it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the department of mysteries 
 
 he turned around the light was coming from the pensieve sitting on desk the contents were ebbing and swirling within thoughts things he did not want harry to see if he broke through defences accidentally 
 
 harry gazed at the pensieve curiosity welling inside him what was it that snape was so keen to hide from harry 
 
 the silvery lights shivered on the wall harry took two steps towards the desk thinking hard could it possibly be information about the department of mysteries that snape was determined to keep from him 
 
 harry looked over his shoulder his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever how long would it take snape to release montague from the toilet would he come straight back to his office afterwards or accompany montague to the hospital wing surely the latter montague was captain of the slytherin quidditch team snape would want to make sure he was all right 
 
 harry walked the remaining few feet to the pensieve and stood over it gazing into its depths he hesitated listening then pulled out his wand again the office and the corridor beyond were completely silent he gave the contents of the pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand 
 
 the silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent he was once again looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling in fact unless he was much mistaken he was looking down into the great hall 
 
 his breath was actually fogging the surface of thoughts his brain seemed to be in limbo it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do he was trembling snape could be back at any moment but harry thought of anger of jeering face and a reckless daring seized him 
 
 he took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of thoughts at once the floor of the office lurched tipping harry into the pensieve 
 
 he was falling through cold blackness spinning furiously as he went and then 
 
 he was standing in the middle of the great hall but the four house tables were gone instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables all facing the same way at each of which sat a student head bent low scribbling on a roll of parchment the only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment it was clearly exam time 
 
 sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light harry looked around carefully snape had to be here somewhere this was his memory 
 
 and there he was at a table right behind harry harry stared had a stringy pallid look about him like a plant kept in the dark his hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled harry moved around behind snape and read the heading of the examination paper defence against the dark artsordinary wizarding level 
 
 so snape had to be fifteen or sixteen around own age his hand was flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped 
 
 five more minutes 
 
 the voice made harry jump turning he saw the top of professor head moving between the desks a short distance away professor flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair 
 
 harry moved so quickly that had he been solid he would have knocked desks flying instead he seemed to slide dreamlike across two aisles and up a third the back of the head drew nearer and he was straightening up now putting down his quill pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written 
 
 harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his father 
 
 excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes eyes were hazel his nose was slightly longer than and there was no scar on his forehead but they had the same thin face same mouth same eyebrows hair stuck up at the back exactly as did his hands could have been and harry could tell that when james stood up they would be within an inch of each other in height 
 
 james yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair making it even messier than it had been then with a glance towards professor flitwick he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him 
 
 with another shock of excitement harry saw sirius give james the sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease tilting it back on two legs he was very his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither nor could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he seem to have noticed and two seats along from this stomach gave another pleasurable squirm was remus lupin he looked rather pale and peaky was the full moon approaching and was absorbed in the exam as he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill frowning slightly 
 
 so that meant wormtail had to be around here somewhere too and sure enough harry spotted him within seconds a small boy with a pointed nose wormtail looked anxious he was chewing his fingernails staring down at his paper scuffing the ground with his toes every now and then he glanced hopefully at his paper harry stared at wormtail for a moment then back at james who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment he had drawn a snitch and was now tracing the letters what did they stand for 
 
 quills down please squeaked professor flitwick that means you too stebbins please remain seated while i collect your parchment accio 
 
 over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into professor outstretched arms knocking him backwards off his feet several people laughed a couple of students at the front desks got up took hold of professor flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet 
 
 thank you thank you panted professor flitwick very well everybody free to go 
 
 harry looked down at his father who had hastily crossed out the he had been embellishing jumped to his feet stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for sirius to join him 
 
 harry looked around and glimpsed snape a short way away moving between the tables towards the doors to the entrance hall still absorbed in his own exam paper yet angular he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider and his oily hair was jumping about his face 
 
 a gang of chattering girls separated snape from james sirius and lupin and by planting himself in their midst harry managed to keep snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of james and his friends 
 
 did you like question ten moony asked sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall 
 
 loved it said lupin briskly give five signs that identify the question 
 
 think you managed to get all the signs said james in tones of mock concern 
 
 think i did said lupin seriously as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds one sitting on my chair two wearing my clothes three his remus lupin 
 
 wormtail was the only one who laugh 
 
 i got the snout shape the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail he said anxiously but i think what else 
 
 how thick are you wormtail said james impatiently you run round with a werewolf once a month 
 
 keep your voice down implored lupin 
 
 harry looked anxiously behind him again snape remained close by still buried in his exam questionsbut this was memory and harry was sure that if snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds he harry would not be able to follow james any further to his intense relief however when james and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake snape followed still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going by keeping a little ahead of him harry managed to maintain a close watch on james and the others 
 
 well i thought that paper was a piece of cake he heard sirius say be surprised if i get outstanding on it at least 
 
 me too said james he put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling golden snitch 
 
 you get that 
 
 nicked it said james casually he started playing with the snitch allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again his reflexes were excellent wormtail watched him in awe 
 
 they stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where harry ron and hermione had once spent a sunday finishing their homework and threw themselves down on the grass harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw to his delight that snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes he was as deeply immersed in the owl paper as ever which left harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree the sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the great hall were sitting with their shoes and socks off cooling their feet in the water 
 
 lupin had pulled out a book and was reading sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass looking rather haughty and bored but very handsomely so james was still playing with the snitch letting it zoom further and further away almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second wormtail was watching him with his mouth open every time james made a particularly difficult catch wormtail gasped and applauded after five minutes of this harry wondered why james tell wormtail to get a grip on himself but james seemed to be enjoying the attention harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy and he also kept looking over at the girls by the edge 
 
 put that away will you said sirius finally as james made a fine catch and wormtail let out a cheer before wormtail wets himself with excitement 
 
 wormtail turned slightly pink but james grinned 
 
 if it bothers you he said stuffing the snitch back in his pocket harry had the distinct impression that sirius was the only one for whom james would have stopped showing off 
 
 bored said sirius wish it was full moon 
 
 you might said lupin darkly from behind his book still got transfiguration if bored you could test me here and he held out his book 
 
 but sirius snorted i need to look at that rubbish i know it all 
 
 liven you up padfoot said james quietly look who it is head turned he became very still like a dog that has scented a rabbit 
 
 excellent he said softly snivellus 
 
 harry turned to see what sirius was looking at 
 
 snape was on his feet again and was stowing the owl paper in his bag as he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass sirius and james stood up 
 
 lupin and wormtail remained sitting lupin was still staring down at his book though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows wormtail was looking from sirius and james to snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face 
 
 all right snivellus said james loudly 
 
 snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack dropping his bag he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when james shouted expelliarmus 
 
 wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him sirius let out a bark of laughter 
 
 impedimenta he said pointing his wand at snape who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand 
 
 students all around had turned to watch some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer some looked apprehensive others entertained 
 
 snape lay panting on the ground james and sirius advanced on him wands raised james glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the edge as he went wormtail was on his feet now watching hungrily edging around lupin to get a clearer view 
 
 the exam go snivelly said james 
 
 i was watching him his nose was touching the parchment said sirius viciously be great grease marks all over it they be able to read a word 
 
 several people watching laughed snape was clearly unpopular wormtail sniggered shrilly snape was trying to get up but the jinx was still operating on him he was struggling as though bound by invisible ropes 
 
 youwait he panted staring up at james with an expression of purest loathing you wait 
 
 wait for what said sirius coolly you going to do snivelly wipe your nose on us 
 
 snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened 
 
 wash out your mouth said james coldly scourgify 
 
 pink soap bubbles streamed from mouth at once the froth was covering his lips making him gag choking him 
 
 leave him alone 
 
 james and sirius looked round free hand immediately jumped to his hair 
 
 it was one of the girls from the lake edge she had thick dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green eyes 
 
 mother 
 
 all right evans said james and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant deeper more mature 
 
 leave him alone lily repeated she was looking at james with every sign of great dislike he done to you 
 
 well said james appearing to deliberate the point more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean 
 
 many of the surrounding students laughed sirius and wormtail included but lupin still apparently intent on his book and nor did lily 
 
 you think funny she said coldly but just an arrogant bullying toerag potter leave him alone 
 
 i will if you go out with me evans said james quickly go on go out with me and never lay a wand on old snivelly again 
 
 behind him the impediment jinx was wearing off snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand spitting out soapsuds as he crawled 
 
 i go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid said lily 
 
 bad luck prongs said sirius briskly and turned back to snape oi 
 
 but too late snape had directed his wand straight at james there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of face spattering his robes with blood james whirled about a second flash of light later snape was hanging in the air his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants 
 
 many people in the small crowd cheered sirius james and wormtail roared with laughter 
 
 lily whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile said let him down 
 
 certainly said james and he jerked his wand upwards snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet wand up but sirius said petrificus totalus and snape keeled over again rigid as a board 
 
 leave him alone lily shouted she had her own wand out now james and sirius eyed it warily 
 
 ah evans make me hex you said james earnestly 
 
 take the curse off him then 
 
 james sighed deeply then turned to snape and muttered the 
 
 there you go he said as snape struggled to his feet lucky evans was here snivellus 
 
 i need help from filthy little mudbloods like her 
 
 lily blinked 
 
 fine she said coolly i bother in future and wash your pants if i were you snivellus 
 
 apologise to evans james roared at snape his wand pointed threateningly at him 
 
 i want you to make him apologise lily shouted rounding on james as bad as he is 
 
 what yelped james never call you 
 
 messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid snitch walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it you make me sick 
 
 she turned on her heel and hurried away 
 
 evans james shouted after her hey evans 
 
 but she look back 
 
 what is it with her said james trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him 
 
 reading between the lines say she thinks a bit conceited mate said sirius 
 
 right said james who looked furious now right 
 
 there was another flash of light and snape was once again hanging in the air 
 
 who wants to see me take off pants 
 
 but whether james really did take off pants harry never found out a hand had closed tight over his upper arm closed with a grip wincing harry looked round to see who had hold of him and saw with a thrill of horror a fully grown snape standing right beside him white with rage 
 
 having fun 
 
 harry felt himself rising into the air the day evaporated around him he was floating upwards through icy blackness hand still tight upon his upper arm then with a swooping feeling as though he had turned in midair his feet hit the stone floor of dungeon and he was standing again beside the pensieve on desk in the shadowy potion study 
 
 so said snape gripping arm so tightly hand was starting to feel numb so been enjoying yourself potter 
 
 said harry trying to free his arm 
 
 it was scary lips were shaking his face was white his teeth were bared 
 
 amusing man your father he said snape shaking harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose 
 
 
 
 snape threw harry from him with all his might harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor 
 
 you will not repeat what you saw to anybody snape bellowed 
 
 no said harry getting to his feet as far from snape as he could no of course i w 
 
 get out get out i want to see you in this office ever again 
 
 and as harry hurtled towards the door a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head he wrenched the door open and hew along the corridor stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and snape there he leaned against the wall panting and rubbing his bruised arm 
 
 he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early nor to tell ron and hermione what he had just seen what was making harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers knew exactly how snape had felt as his father had taunted him and that judging from what he had just seen his father had been every bit as arrogant as snape had always told him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter flight of the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened it could not have happened 
 
 out of here quickly said snape 
 
 he seized malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly as they vanished through the door harry realized he could move again what was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic but horror and shock he threw the invisibility cloak aside as the death eater last to leave the tower top was disappearing through the door 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the death eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid as a waxwork but he had barely hit the floor when harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase 
 
 terror tore at heart he had to get to dumbledore and he had to catch snape somehow the two things were linked he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together dumbledore could not have died 
 
 he leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wand raised the dimly lit corridor was full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout over time to go and saw snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed as harry plunged after them one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him it was the werewolf fenrir he was on top of harry before harry could raise his wand harry fell backward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 harry felt greyback collapse against him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight his feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled there were two bodies lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there was no time to investigate harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy death eater amycus who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them amycus was giggling enjoying the sport cruciocrucioyou dance forever pretty 
 
 impedimenta yelled harry 
 
 his jinx hit amycus in the chest he gave a piglike squeal of pain was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behind ron professor mcgonagall and lupin each of whom was battling a separate death eater beyond them harry saw tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window 
 
 harry where did you come from ginny cried but there was no time to answer her he put his head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head showering them all in bits of wall snape must not escape he must catch up with snape 
 
 take that shouted professor mcgonagall and harry glimpsed the female death eater alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head her brother right behind her he launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he was lying across legs looking around he saw pale round face flat against the floor 
 
 neville are you 
 
 right muttered neville who was clutching his stomach harry snape n malfoy ran past 
 
 i know on it said harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond death eater who was causing most of the chaos the man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face he wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him the yells of the others to come back and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know 
 
 he skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood snape had an immense head start was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the room of requirement or had the order made steps to secure it to prevent the death eaters retreating that way he could hear nothing but his own pounding feet his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing death eaters was heading toward the front doorsperhaps the room of requirement was indeed blocked 
 
 he skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded he saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring paintings as he leapt the wreckage of armor harry heard more shouts and screams other people within the castle seemed to have awoken 
 
 he pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on snape and malfoy who must surely have reached the grounds by now remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and hufflepuffs stood 
 
 harry we heard a noise and someone said something about the dark mark began ernie macmillan 
 
 out of the way yelled harry knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase the oak front doors had been blasted open there were smears of blood on the flagstones and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces the giant gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstones below 
 
 harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds he could just make out three figures racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could disapparateby the looks of them the huge blond death eater and some way ahead of him snape and malfoy 
 
 the cold night air ripped at lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry he did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse 
 
 another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and harry understood hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the death eaters escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not hagrid not hagrid too 
 
 something caught harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils he knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him 
 
 impedimenta he yelled as he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after snape 
 
 and now he saw the vast outline of hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds the blond death eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper but immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him snape and malfoy however were still running they would soon be beyond the gates able to disapparate 
 
 harry tore past hagrid and his opponent took aim at back and yelled stupefy 
 
 he missed the jet of red light soared past head snape shouted run draco and turned twenty yards apart he and harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously 
 
 cruc 
 
 but snape parried the curse knocking harry backward off his feet before he could complete it harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge death eater behind him yelled incendio harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them house was on fire 
 
 in there yer evil hagrid bellowed 
 
 cruc yelled harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but snape blocked the spell again harry could see him sneering 
 
 no unforgivable curses from you potter he shouted over the rushing of the flames yells and the wild yelping of the trapped fang you got the nerve or the ability 
 
 roared but snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm 
 
 fight back harry screamed at him fight back you cowardly 
 
 coward did you call me potter shouted snape your father would never attack me unless it was four on one what would you call him i wonder 
 
 stupe 
 
 blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed potter sneered snape deflecting the curse once more now come he shouted at the huge death eater behind harry it is time to be gone before the ministry turns up 
 
 impedi 
 
 but before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit harry he keeled over in the grass someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony snape was going to torture him to death or madness 
 
 no roared voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead snape was shouting have you forgotten our orders potter belongs to the dark lordwe are to leave him go go 
 
 and harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous death eater obeyed running toward the gates harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage in that instant he cared not whether he lived or died pushing himself to his feet again he staggered blindly toward snape the man he now hated as much as he hated voldemort himself 
 
 sectum 
 
 snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again but harry was mere feet away now and he could see face clearly at last he was no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flames showed a face full of rage mustering all his powers of concentration harry thought levi 
 
 no potter screamed snape there was a loud bang and harry was soaring backward hitting the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand he could hear hagrid yelling and fang howling as snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless as dumbledore had been pale face illuminated by the flaming cabin was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed dumbledore 
 
 you dare use my own spells against me potter it was i who invented themi the prince and turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you i think so no 
 
 harry had dived for his wand snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight 
 
 kill me then panted harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt kill me like you killed him you coward 
 
 screamed snape and his face was suddenly demented inhuman as though he was in as much pain as the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them call me coward 
 
 and he slashed at the air harry felt a whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars buckbeak had flown at snape who staggered backward as the claws slashed at him as harry raised himself into a sitting position his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground he saw snape running as hard as he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as harry had never heard him screech 
 
 harry struggled to his feet looking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass discarding twigs he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates snape had managed to disapparate just beyond the boundaries 
 
 hagrid muttered harry still dazed looking around hagrid 
 
 he stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying fang on his back with a cry of thankfulness harry sank to his knees he was shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stabs 
 
 yeh all righ harry yeh all righ speak ter me harry 
 
 huge hairy face was swimming above harry blocking out the stars harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him 
 
 all right panted harry are you 
 
 course i am take that ter finish me 
 
 hagrid put his hands under arms and raised him up with such force that feet momentarily left the ground before hagrid set him upright again he could see blood trickling down cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly 
 
 we should put out your house said harry the aguamenti 
 
 knew it was summat like that mumbled hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink flowery umbrella and said aguamenti 
 
 a jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured aguamenti too together he and hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished 
 
 s not too bad said hagrid hopefully a few minutes later looking at the smoking wreck nothin dumbledore won be able to put right 
 
 harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name in the silence and the stillness horror rose inside him 
 
 hagrid 
 
 i was bindin up a couple o bowtruckle legs when i heard em coming said hagrid sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin bin burnt ter twigs poor little things 
 
 hagrid 
 
 but what happened harry i jus saw them death eaters runnin down from the castle but what the ruddy hell was snape doin with em he gonewas he chasin them 
 
 he harry cleared his throat it was dry from panic and the smoke hagrid he killed

 hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending

 don say that said hagrid roughly snape kill dumbledoredon be stupid harry made yeh say tha 
 
 i saw it happen 
 
 yeh couldn have 
 
 i saw it hagrid 
 
 hagrid shook his head his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic and harry knew that hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he was confused perhaps by the of a jinx 
 
 what musta happened was dumbledore musta told snape ter go with them death eaters hagrid said confidently i suppose gotta keep his cover look get yeh back up ter the school come on harry 
 
 harry did not attempt to argue or explain he was still shaking uncontrollably hagrid would find out soon enough too soon as they directed their steps back toward the castle harry saw that many of its windows were lit now he could imagine clearly the scenes inside as people moved from room to room telling each other that death eaters had got in that the mark was shining over hogwarts that somebody must have been killed 
 
 the oak front doors stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn slowly uncertainly people were creeping down the steps looking around nervously for some sign of the death eaters who had fled into the night eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower he imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought body must lie however he saw people beginning to move toward it 
 
 they all lookin at said hagrid as he and harry approached the castle front fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles that lyin on the grass hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the astronomy tower where a small crowd was congregating see it harry right at the foot of the tower under where the mark blimey yeh don think someone got thrown 
 
 hagrid fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud harry walked alongside him feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way as though somebody near him was suffering them what was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest 
 
 he and hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap 
 
 harry heard moan of pain and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him 
 
 harry had known there was no hope from the moment that the full curse dumbledore had placed upon him lifted known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead but there was still no preparation for seeing him here broken the greatest wizard harry had ever or would ever meet 
 
 eyes were closed but for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping harry reached out straightened the spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth that never again would dumbledore speak to him never again could he help 
 
 the crowd murmured behind harry after what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down 
 
 the locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of pocket it had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground and although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already harry knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong 
 
 he turned the locket over in his hands this was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the pensieve nor were there any markings upon it no sign of the ornate s that was supposed to be mark moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been 
 
 automatically without really thinking about what he was doing harry pulled out the fragment of parchment opened it and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him 
 
 to the dark lord 
 
 i know i will be dead long before you read this but i want you to know that it was i who dicovered your secret i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can 
 
 i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more 
 
 
 
 harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant only one thing mattered this was not a horcrux dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him fang began to howl

lionfish nov chapter the missing mirrorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harrys feet touched the road he saw the achingly familiar hogsmeade high street dark shop fronts and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward hogwarts and light spilling from the windows of the three broomsticks and with a lurch of the hear he remembered with piercing accuracy how he had landed here nearly a year before supporting a desperately weak dumbledore all this in a second upon landing c and then even as he relaxed his grip upon rons and hermiones arms it happened 
 
 the air was rent by a scream that sounded like voldemorts when he had realized the cup had been stolen it tore at every nerve in harrys body and he knew that their appearance had caused it 
 
 even as he looked at the other two beneath the cloak the door of the three broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded death eaters dashed into the streets their wands aloft 
 
 harry seized rons wrist as he raised his wand there were too many of them to run even attempting it would have give away their position one of the death eaters raised his wand and the scream stopped still echoing around the distant mountains 
 
 accio cloak roared one of the death eaters harry seized his folds but it made no attempt to escape the summoning charm had not worked on it 
 
 not under your wrapper then potter yelled the death eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows spread now hes here 
 
 six of the death eaters ran toward them harry ron and hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street and the death eaters missed them by inches they waited in the darkness listening to the footsteps running up and down beams of light flying along the street from the death eaters searching wands 
 
 lets just leave hermione whispered disapparate now 
 
 great idea said ron but before harry could reply a death eater shouted we know you are here potter and theres no getting away well find you 
 
 they were ready for us whispered harry they set up that spell to tell them wed come i reckon theyve done something to keep us here trap us c 
 
 what about dementors called another death eater letem have free rein theyd find him quick enough 
 
 the dark lord wants potter dead by no hands but his c 
 
 an dementors wont kill him the dark lord wants potters life nor his soul hell be easier to kill if hes been kissed first 
 
 there were noises of agreement dread filled harry to repel dementors they would have to produce patronuses which would give them away immediately 
 
 were going to have to try to disapparate harry hermione whispered 
 
 even as she said it he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars which vanished in the pitch blackness he felt hermione take hold of his arm and together they turned on the spot 
 
 the air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid they could not disapparate the death eaters had cast their charms well the cold was biting deeper and deeper into harrys flesh he ron and hermione retreated down the side street groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound then around the corner gliding noiselessly came dementors ten or more of them visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands could they sense fear in the vicinity harry was sure of it they seemed to be coming more quickly now taking those dragging rattling breaths he detested tasting despair in the air closing in he raised his wand he could not would not suffer the dementors kiss whatever happened afterward it was of ron and hermione that he thought as he whispered expecto patronum 
 
 the silver stag burst from his wand and charged the dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight 
 
 its him down there down there i saw his patronus it was a stag 
 
 the dementors have retreated the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the death eaters were becoming louder but before harry in his panic could decide what to do there was a grinding of bolts nearby a door opened on the of the narrow street and a rough voice said potter in here quick 
 
 he obeyed without hesitation the three of them hurried through the open doorway 
 
 upstairs keep the cloak on keep quiet muttered a tall figure passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him 
 
 harry had had no idea where they were but now he saw by the stuttering light of a single candle the grubby sawdust bar of the hogs head inn they ran behind the counter and through a second doorway which led to a trickery wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could the stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness 
 
 shouts reached from the streets below still wearing the invisibility cloak on they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down their savior whom harry now recognized as the hogs heads barman was the only person not wearing a hood 
 
 so what he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces so what you send dementors down my street ill send a patronus back atem im not havingem near me ive told you that im not having it 
 
 that wasnt your patronus said a death eater that was a stag it was potters 
 
 stag roared the barman and he pulled out a wand stag you idiot c expecto patronum 
 
 something huge and horned erupted from the wand head down it charged toward the high street and out of sight 
 
 thats not what i saw said the death eater though was less certainly curfews been broken you heard the noise one of his companions told the barman someone was out on the streets against regulations c 
 
 if i want to put my cat out i will and be damned to your curfew 
 
 you set off the caterwauling charm 
 
 what if i did going to cart me off to azkaban kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door do it then if you want to but i hope for your sakes you havent pressed your little dark marks and summoned him hes not going to like being called here for me and my old cat is he now 
 
 dont worry about us said one of the death eaters worry about yourself breaking curfew 
 
 and where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pubs closed down what will happen to your little sidelines then 
 
 are you threatening c 
 
 i keep my mouth shut its why you come here isnt it 
 
 i still say i saw a stag patronus shouted the first death eater 
 
 stag roared the barman its a goat idiot 
 
 all right we made a mistake said the second death eater break curfew again and we wont be so lenient 
 
 the death eaters strode back towards the high street hermione moaned with relief wove out from under the cloak and sat down on a chair harry drew the curtains then pulled the cloak off himself and ron they could hear the barman down below rebolting the door of the bar then climbing the stairs 
 
 harrys attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece a small rectangular mirror propped on top of it right beneath the portrait of the girl 
 
 the barman entered the room 
 
 you bloody fools he said gruffly looking from one to the other of them what were you thinking coming here 
 
 thank you said harry you cant thank you enough you saved our lives 
 
 the barman grunted harry approached him looking up into the face trying to see past the long stringy hair beard he wore spectacles behind the dirty lenses the eyes were a piercing brilliant blue 
 
 its your eye ive been seeing in the mirror 
 
 there was a silence in the room harry and the barman looked at each other 
 
 you sent dobby 
 
 the barman nodded and looked around for the elf 
 
 thought hed be with you whereve you left him 
 
 hes dead said harry bellatrix lestrange killed him 
 
 the barman face was impassive after a few moments he said im sorry to hear it i liked that elf 
 
 he turned away lightning lamps with prods of his wand not looking at any of them 
 
 youre aberforth said harry to the mans back 
 
 he neither confirmed or denied it but bent to light the fire 
 
 how did you get this harry asked walking across to siriuss mirror the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before 
 
 bought it from dung bout a year ago said aberforth albus told me what it was been trying to keep an eye out for you 
 
 ron gasped 
 
 the silver doe he said excitedly was that you too 
 
 what are you talking about asked aberforth 
 
 someone sent a doe patronus to us 
 
 brains like that you could be a death eater son havent i just prove my patronus is a goat 
 
 oh said ron yeah well im hungry he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble 
 
 i got food said aberforth and he sloped out of the room reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread some cheese and a pewter jug of mead which he set upon a small table in front of the fire 
 
 ravenous they ate and drank and for a while there was sound of chewing 
 
 right then said aberforth when the had eaten their fill and harry and ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs we need to think of the best way to get you out of here cant be done by night you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness caterwauling charms set off theyll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs i dont reckon ill be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time wait for daybreak when curfew lifts then you can put your cloak back on and set out on foot get right out of hogsmeade up into the mountains and youll be able to disapparate there might see hagrid hes been hiding in a cave up there with grawp ever since they tried to arrest him 
 
 were not leaving said harry we need to get into hogwarts 
 
 dont be stupid boy said aberforth 
 
 weve got to said harry 
 
 what youve got to do said aberforth leaning forward is to get as far from here as from here as you can 
 
 you dont understand there isnt much time weve got to get into the castle dumbledore c i mean your brother c wanted us c 
 
 the firelight made the grimy lenses of aberforths glasses momentarily opaque a bright flat white and harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider aragog 
 
 my brother albus wanted a lot of things said aberforth and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans you get away from this school potter and out of the country if you can forget my brother and his clever schemes hes gone where none of this can hurt him and you dont owe him anything 
 
 you dont understand said harry again 
 
 oh dont i said aberforth quietly you dont think i understood my own brother think you know albus better than i did 
 
 i didnt mean that said harry whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine its he left me a job 
 
 did he now said aberforth nice job i hope pleasant easy sort of thing youd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves 
 
 ron gave a rather grim laugh hermione was looking strained 
 
 not easy no said harry but ive got to c 
 
 got to why got to hes dead isnt he said aberforth roughly let it go boy before you follow him save yourself 
 
 i cant 
 
 why not 
 
 i c harry felt overwhelmed he could not explain so he took the offensive instead but youre fighting too youre in the order of the phoenix c 
 
 i was said aberforth the order of the phoenix is finished won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves itll never be safe for you here potter he wants you too badly so go abroad go into hiding save yourself best take these two with you he jerked a thumb at ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows theyve been working with you 
 
 i cant leave said harry ive got a job c 
 
 give it to someone else 
 
 i cant its got to be me dumbledore explained it all c 
 
 oh did he now and did he tell you everything was he honest with you 
 
 harry wanted him with all his heart to say yes but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking 
 
 i knew my brother potter he learned secrecy at our mothers knee secrets and lies thats how we grew up and albus he was a natural 
 
 the old mans eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece it was now harry looked around properly the only picture in the room there was no photograph of albus dumbledore nor of anyone else 
 
 mr dumbledore said hermione rather timidly is that your sister ariana 
 
 yes said aberforth tersely been reading rita skeeter have you missy 
 
 even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that hermione had turned red 
 
 elphias doge mentioned her to us said harry trying to spare hermione 
 
 that old berk muttered aberforth taking another swig of mead thought the sun shone out of my brothers every ocrifice he did well so did plenty of people you three included by the looks of it 
 
 harry kept quiet he did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about dumbledore that had riddled him for months now he had made his choice while he dug dobbys grave he had decided to continue along the winding dangerous path indicated for him by albus dumbledore to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know but simply to trust he had no desire to doubt again he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose he met aberforths gaze which was so strikingly like his brothers the bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were the object of their scrutiny and harry thought that aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it 
 
 professor dumbledore cared about harry very much said hermione in a low voice 
 
 did he now said aberforth funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if hed left em well alone 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione breathlessly 
 
 never you mind said aberforth 
 
 but thats a really serious thing to say said hermione are you c are you talking about your sister 
 
 aberforth glared at her his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back then he burst into speech 
 
 when my sister was six years old she was attacked by three muggle boys theyd seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge she was a kid she couldnt control it no witch or wizard can at that age what they saw scared them i expect they forced their way through the hedge and when she couldnt show them the trick they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it 
 
 hermiones eyes were huge in the firelight ron looked slightly sick aberforth stood up tall as albus and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain 
 
 it destroyed her what they did she was never right again she wouldnt use magic but she couldnt get rid of it it turned inward and drove her mad it exploded out of her when she couldnt control it and at times she was strange and dangerous but mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless 
 
 and my father went after the bastards that did it said aberforth and attacked them and they locked him up in azkaban for it he never said why hed done it because the ministry had known what ariana had become shed have been locked up in st mungos for good theyd have seen her as a serious threat to the international statute of secrecy unbalanced like she was with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldnt keep it in any longer 
 
 we had to keep her safe and quiet we moved house put it about she was ill and my mother looked after her and tried to keep her calm and happy 
 
 i was her favourite he said and as he said it a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through aberforths wrinkles and wrangled beard not albus he was always up in his bedroom when he was home reading his books and counting his prizes keeping up with his correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day 
 
 aberforth succored he didnt want to be bothered with her she liked me best i could get her to eat when she wouldnt do it for my mother i could calm her down when she was in one of her rages and when she was quiet she used to help me feed the goats 
 
 then when she was fourteen see i wasnt there said aberforth if id been there i could have calmed her down she had one of her rages and my mother wasnt as young as she was and it was an accident ariana couldnt control it but my mother was killed 
 
 harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion he did not want to hear any more but aberforth kept talking and harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this whether in fact he had ever spoken about it 
 
 so that put paid to albuss trip round the world with little doge the pair of em came home for my mothers funeral and then doge went off on his own and albus settled down as head of the family ha 
 
 aberforth spat into the fire 
 
 id have looked after her i told him so i didnt care about school id have stayed home and done it 
 
 he told me i had to finish my education and hed take over from my mother bit of a comedown for mr brilliant theres no prizes for looking after your sister stopping her blowing up the house every other day but he did all right for a few weeks till he came 
 
 and now a positively dangerous look crept over aberforths face 
 
 grindelwald and at last my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was and looking after ariana took a backseat then while they were hatching all their plans for a new wizarding order and looking for hallows and whatever else it was they were so interested in grand plans for the benefit of all wizardkind and if one young girl neglected what did that matter when albus was working for the greater good 
 
 but after a few weeks of it id had enough i had it was nearly time for me to go hack to hogwarts so i told em both of em like i am to you now and aberforth looked downward harry and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager wiry and angry confronting his elder brother i told him youd better give it up now you cant move her shes in no fit state you cant take her with you wherever it is youre planning to go when youre making your clever speeches trying to whip yourselves up a following he didnt like that said aberforth and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses they turned white and blind again grindelwald didnt like that at all he got angry he told me what a stupid little boy i was trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother didnt i understand my poor sister wouldnt have to be hidden once theyd changed the world and led the wizards out of hiding and taught the muggles their place 
 
 and there was an argument and i pulled my wand and he pulled out his and i had the cruciatus curse used on me by my brothers best friend c and albus was trying to stop him and then all three of us were dueling and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off she couldnt stand it c 
 
 the color was draining from aberforths face as though he had suffered a mortal wound 
 
 c and i think she wanted to help but she didnt really know what she was doing and i dont know which of us did it it could have been any of us c and she was dead 
 
 his voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair hermiones face was wet with tears and ron was almost as pale as aberforth harry felt nothing but revulsion he wished he had not heard it wished he could wash is mind clean of it 
 
 im so im so sorry hermione whispered 
 
 gone croaked aberforth gone forever 
 
 he wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat 
 
 course grindelwald scarpered he had a bit of a track record already back in his own country and he didnt want ariana set to his account too and albus was free wasnt he free of the burden of his sister free to become the greatest wizard of the c 
 
 he was never free said harry 
 
 i beg your pardon said aberforth 
 
 never said harry the night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind he started screaming pleading with someone who wasnt there dont hurt them please hurt me instead 
 
 ron and hermione were staring at harry he had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake 
 
 the events that had taken place after he and dumbledore had returned to hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly 
 
 he thought he was back there with you and grindelwald i know he did said harry remembering dumbledore whispering pleading 
 
 he thought he was watching grindelwald hurting you and ariana it was torture to him if youd seen him then you wouldnt say he was free 
 
 aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands after a long pause he said how can you be sure potter that my brother wasnt more interested in the greater good than in you how can you be sure you arent dispensable just like my little sister 
 
 a shard of ice seemed to pierce harrys heart 
 
 i dont believe it dumbledore loved harry said hermione 
 
 why didnt he tell him to hide then shot back aberforth why didnt he say to him take care of yourself heres how to survive 
 
 because said harry before hermione could answer sometimes youve got to think about more than your own safety sometimes youve got to think about the greater good this is war 
 
 youre seventeen boy 
 
 im of age and im going to keep fighting even if youve given up 
 
 who says ive given up 
 
 the order of the phoenix is finished harry repeated won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves 
 
 i dont say i like it but its the truth 
 
 no it isnt said harry your brother knew how to finish and he passed the knowledge on to me im going to keep going until i succeed c or i die dont think i dont know how this might end ive known it for years 
 
 he waited for aberforth to jeer or to argue but he did not he merely moved 
 
 we need to get into hogwarts said harry again if you cant help us well wait till daybreak leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves if you can help us c well now would be a great time to mention it 
 
 aberforth remained fixed in his chair gazing at harry with the eye that were so extraordinarily like his brothers at last he cleared his throat got to his feet walked around the little table and approached the portrait of ariana 
 
 you know what to do he said 
 
 she smiled turned and walked away not as people in portraits usually did one of the sides of their frames but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her they watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness 
 
 er c what c began ron 
 
 theres only one way in now said aberforth you must know theyve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends dementors all around the boundary walls regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me the place has never been so heavily guarded 
 
 how you expect to do anything once you get inside it with snape in charge and the carrows as his deputies well thats your lookout isnt it you say youre prepared to die 
 
 but what said hermione frowning at arianas picture 
 
 a tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel and now ariana was walking back toward them growing bigger and bigger as she came but there was somebody else with her now someone taller than she was who was limping along looking excited his hair was longer than harry had ever seen he appeared and torn larger and larger the two figures grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait 
 
 then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed and out of it his hair overgrown his face cut his robes ripped clambered the real neville longbottom who gave a roar of delight leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled 
 
 i knew youd come i knew it harry 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 she was good for nothing 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the mayor stood at the open window he looked smart for his 
 in which he had stuck a and his ruffles were 
 very fine he had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth although he had cut himself slightly and had stuck a piece of newspaper over the 
 place hark ee youngster cried he 
 
 the boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a poor 
 who was just going past the house he stopped and 
 respectfully took off his cap the peak of this cap was broken in 
 the middle so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his 
 pocket he stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and 
 clothes with heavy wooden shoes on his feet looking as humble as if it had been the king himself 
 
 you are a good and civil boy said the mayor i suppose your 
 mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river and you are 
 going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket it is 
 very bad for your mother how much have you got in it 
 
 only half a quartern stammered the boy in a frightened voice 
 
 and she has had just as much this morning already 
 
 no it was yesterday replied the boy 
 
 two halves make a whole said the mayor good for 
 nothing what a sad thing it is with these people tell your mother 
 she ought to be ashamed of herself you become a drunkard but i expect you will though poor child there go now 
 
 the boy went on his way with his cap in his hand while the wind 
 fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up straight he 
 turned round the corner of the street into the little lane that led to 
 the river where his mother stood in the water by her washing bench 
 beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar the floodgates at the 
 mill had been drawn up and as the water rolled rapidly on the sheets 
 were dragged along by the stream and nearly overturned the bench 
 so that the was obliged to lean against it to keep it 
 steady i have been very nearly carried away she said it is a 
 good thing that you are come for i want something to strengthen me 
 it is cold in the water and i have stood here six hours have you 
 brought anything for me 
 
 the boy drew the bottle from his pocket and the mother put it 
 to her lips and drank a little 
 
 ah how much good that does and how it warms me she said 
 
 it is as good as a hot meal and not so dear drink a little my boy 
 you look quite pale you are shivering in your thin clothes and 
 autumn has really come oh how cold the water is i hope i shall 
 not be ill but no i must not be afraid of that give me a little 
 more and you may have a sip too but only a sip you must not get 
 used to it my poor dear child she stepped up to the bridge on 
 which the boy stood as she spoke and came on shore the water dripped from the straw mat which she had bound round her body and from her gown i work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands said she but i do it willingly that i may be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully my dear boy 
 
 at the same moment a woman rather older than herself came 
 towards them she was a object lame of one leg and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her eyes which was blind this curl was intended to conceal the blind eye but it made the defect only more visible she was a friend of the laundress and was called among the neighbors lame martha with the curl 
 oh you poor thing how you do work standing there in the water she exclaimed you really do need something to give you a little 
 warmth and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you take 
 
 and then martha repeated to the laundress in a very few minutes 
 all that the mayor had said to her boy which she had overheard and 
 she felt very angry that any man could speak as he had done of a 
 mother to her own child about the few drops she had taken and she 
 was still more angry because on that very day the mayor was going to have a at which there would be wine strong rich 
 wine drunk by the bottle many will take more than they ought but 
 they call that drinking they are all right you are good for 
 nothing indeed cried martha indignantly 
 
 and so he spoke to you in that way did he my child said the 
 and her lips trembled as she spoke he says you have a mother who is good for nothing well perhaps he is right but he should not have said it to my child how much has happened to me from that house 
 
 yes said martha i remember you were in service there and 
 lived in the house when the parents were alive how many years ago that is bushels of salt have been eaten since then and people may well be thirsty and martha smiled the great 
 ought to have been put off but the news came 
 too late the footman told me the dinner was already cooked when a 
 letter came to say that the younger brother in copenhagen is 
 dead 
 
 dead cried the laundress turning pale as death 
 
 yes certainly replied martha but why do you take it so 
 much to heart i suppose you knew him years ago when you were in 
 service there 
 
 is he dead she exclaimed oh he was such a kind 
 man there are not many like him and the tears rolled down her 
 cheeks as she spoke then she cried oh dear me i feel quite ill 
 everything is going round me i cannot bear it is the bottle 
 empty and she leaned against the plank 
 
 dear me you are ill indeed said the other woman come 
 cheer up perhaps it will pass off no indeed i see you are really 
 ill the best thing for me to do is to lead you home 
 
 but my washing yonder 
 
 i will take care of that come give me your arm the boy can 
 stay here and take care of the linen and come back and finish 
 the washing it is but a trifle 
 
 the limbs of the laundress shook under her and she said i 
 have stood too long in the cold water and i have had nothing to eat 
 the whole day since the morning o kind heaven help me to get home i am in a burning fever oh my poor child and she burst into tears and he poor boy wept also as he sat alone by the river near to and watching the damp linen 
 
 the two women walked very slowly the laundress slipped and 
 tottered through the lane and round the corner into the street where 
 the mayor lived and just as she reached the front of his house she 
 sank down upon the pavement many persons came round her and lame martha ran into the house for help the mayor and his guests came to the window 
 
 oh it is the laundress said he she has had a little drop too 
 much she is good for nothing it is a sad thing for her pretty little 
 son i like the boy very well but the mother is good for nothing 
 after a while the laundress recovered herself and they led her to 
 her poor dwelling and put her to bed kind martha warmed a mug of 
 beer for her with butter and sugar she considered this the best 
 medicine and then hastened to the river washed and rinsed badly 
 enough to be sure but she did her best then she drew the linen 
 ashore wet as it was and laid it in a basket before evening she 
 was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress the 
 cook had given her some roasted potatoes and a beautiful piece of 
 fat for the sick woman martha and the boy enjoyed these good things very much but the sick woman could only say that the smell was very nourishing she thought the boy was put to bed in the same bed as the one in which his mother lay but he slept at her feet covered with an old quilt made of blue and white patchwork 
 the laundress felt a little better by this time the warm beer had 
 strengthened her and the smell of the good food had been pleasant 
 to her 
 
 many thanks you good soul she said to martha now the boy 
 is asleep i will tell you all he is soon asleep how gentle and 
 sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed he does not know how his mother has suffered and heaven grant he never may know it i was in service at the the father of the mayor and it happened that the youngest of his sons the student came home i was a young wild girl then but honest that i can declare in the sight of heaven the student was merry and gay brave and 
 affectionate every drop of blood in him was good and honorable a 
 better man never lived on earth he was the son of the house and i 
 was only a maid but he loved me truly and honorably and he told 
 his mother of it she was to him as an angel upon earth she was so 
 wise and loving he went to travel and before he started he placed 
 a gold ring on my finger and as soon as he was out of the house my 
 mistress sent for me gently and earnestly she drew me to her and 
 spake as if an angel were speaking she showed me clearly in spirit 
 and in truth the difference there was between him and me he is 
 pleased now she said with your pretty face but good looks do 
 not last long you have not been educated like he has you are not 
 equals in mind and rank and therein lies the misfortune i esteem the 
 poor she added in the sight of god they may occupy a higher place than many of the rich but here upon earth we must beware of 
 entering upon a false track lest we are overturned in our plans like 
 a carriage that travels by a dangerous road i know a worthy man an 
 artisan who wishes to marry you i mean eric the glovemaker he is a widower without children and in a good position will you think it 
 over every word she said pierced my heart like a knife but i knew 
 she was right and the thought pressed heavily upon me i kissed her 
 hand and wept bitter tears and i wept still more when i went to my 
 room and threw myself on the bed i passed through a dreadful 
 night god knows what i suffered and how i struggled the following sunday i went to the house of god to pray for light to direct my path 
 
 it seemed like a providence that as i stepped out of church eric 
 came towards me and then there remained not a doubt in my mind 
 we were suited to each other in rank and circumstances he was even then a man of good means i went up to him and took his hand and said do you still feel the same for me yes ever and always said he will you then marry a maiden who honors and esteems you although she cannot offer you her love but that may come yes it will come said he and we joined our hands together and i went home to my mistress the gold ring which her son had given me i wore next to my heart i could not place it on my finger during the daytime but only in the evening when i went to bed i kissed the ring till my lips almost bled and then i gave it to my mistress and told her that the banns were to be put up for me and the glovemaker the following week then my mistress threw her arms round me and kissed me she did not say that i was good for nothing very likely i was better then than i am now but the misfortunes of this world were unknown to me then at michaelmas we were married and for the first year everything went well with us we had a journeyman and an apprentice and you were our servant martha 
 
 ah yes and you were a dear good mistress said martha i 
 shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to me 
 yes those were happy years when you were with us although we 
 had no children at first the student i never met again yet i saw him 
 once although he did not see me he came to his funeral i 
 saw him looking pale as death and deeply troubled standing at her 
 grave for she was his mother sometime after when his father died 
 he was in foreign lands and did not come home i know that he never 
 married i believe he became a lawyer he had forgotten me and even 
 had we met he would not have known me for i have lost all my good 
 looks and perhaps that is all for the best and then she spoke of 
 the dark days of trial when misfortune had fallen upon them 
 
 we had five hundred dollars she said and there was a house in 
 the street to be sold for two hundred so we thought it would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its place so it 
 was bought the builder and carpenter made an estimate that the new 
 house would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to build eric had 
 credit so he borrowed the money in the chief town but the captain 
 who was bringing it to him was shipwrecked and the money lost 
 just about this time my dear sweet boy who lies sleeping there 
 was born and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering illness 
 
 for three quarters of a year i was obliged to dress and undress him 
 we were backward in our payments we borrowed more money and all that we had was lost and sold and then my husband died since then i have worked toiled and striven for the sake of the child i have 
 scrubbed and washed both coarse and fine linen but i have not been 
 able to make myself better off and it was will in his own time 
 he will take me to himself but i know he will never forsake my 
 boy then she fell asleep in the morning she felt much refreshed 
 and strong enough as she thought to go on with her work but as soon as she stepped into the cold water a sudden faintness seized her she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand took one step forward and fell her head rested on dry land but her feet were in the water her wooden shoes which were only tied on by a wisp of straw were carried away by the stream and thus she was found by martha when she came to bring her some coffee 
 
 in the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by the 
 mayor to say that she must come to him immediately as he had 
 something to tell her it was too late a surgeon had been sent for to 
 open a vein in her arm but the poor woman was dead 
 
 she has drunk herself to death said the cruel mayor in the 
 letter containing the news of his death it was stated that 
 he had left in his will a legacy of six hundred dollars to the 
 widow who had been his maid to be paid with discretion in large or small sums to the widow or her child 
 there was something between my brother and her i remember said the mayor it is a good thing that she is out of the way for now the boy will have the whole i will place him with honest people to 
 bring him up that he may become a respectable working man and the blessing of god rested upon these words the mayor sent for the boy to come to him and promised to take care of him but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his mother was dead for she was good for nothing they carried her to the churchyard the 
 churchyard in which the poor were buried martha strewed sand on the grave and planted a upon it and the boy stood by her side 
 
 oh my poor mother he cried while the tears rolled down his 
 cheeks is it true what they say that she was good for nothing 
 no indeed it is not true replied the old servant raising her 
 eyes to heaven she was worth a great deal i knew it years ago 
 and since the last night of her life i am more certain of it than 
 ever i say she was a good and worthy woman and god who is in 
 heaven knows i am speaking the truth though the world may say 
 even now she was good for nothing

 book enters the shadow 
 chapter ii 
 
 an view of paris 
 a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle 
 all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a city through which run the rues and where a thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris there the glance fell into an abyss 
 thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased 
 the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere and maintained order that is to say night 
 the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed hence nothing was stirring 
 there was nothing but fright mourning stupor in the houses and in the streets a sort of sacred horror not even the long rows of windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements were visible an eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there at intervals of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of the church of and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms 
 all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection 
 the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness 
 a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night all was over 
 no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death 
 where 
 how 
 when 
 no one knew but it was certain and inevitable 
 in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the uprising groping their way were about to come into contact the necessity was the same for both 
 the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors 
 a situation so extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror 
 moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal 
 for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of flight 
 it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish 
 the government understood this as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging 
 here only one sound was audible a sound as as the death rattle as menacing as a malediction the tocsin of nothing could be more than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows 
 as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what men were about to do 
 nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect 
 the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds 
 a black sky rested on these dead streets as though an immense were being outspread over this immense tomb 
 while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar 
 a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from on high like the voice of the thunder

 book thirteen 
 chapter xi 
 
 early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at night it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories called it femgalka karataev and others called it gray or sometimes flabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the dog in the least its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw 
 attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant of his former clothing a pair of trousers which by advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and a peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this time he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested with lice curled round his head like a cap the look of his eyes was resolute calm and animatedly alert as never before the former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were bare 
 pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning then into the distance across the river then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated flitted across his face the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him 
 for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in the mornings what is called an old wives summer 
 in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air 
 on everything far and near lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distance with the village the church and the large white house the bare trees the sand the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spire and the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a mansion occupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence and even that ruined and befouled house which in dull weather was repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now in the clear motionless brilliance 
 a french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on his head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner of the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink 
 what sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just like spring 
 and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it 
 to be on the march in such weather he began 
 pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities 
 besides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captain you know he is a man who never forgets anything speak to the captain when he makes his round he will do anything for you 
 the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors 
 you see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril is a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who 
 has had misfortunes but he is a man he knows what if he wants anything and asks me he get a refusal when one has studied you see one likes education and people it is for your sake i mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill 
 and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight between the prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed 
 a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them 
 ready ready dear fellow said karataev coming out with a neatly folded shirt 
 karataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot his hair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of bast and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever 
 a promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn 
 the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming his hesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt he had a long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin bare body but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly none of the prisoners said a word 
 see it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt straight 
 the frenchman having pushed his head and hands through without raising his eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams 
 you see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no proper tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse said platon with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his work 
 good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french but there must be some linen left over 
 it will fit better still when it sets to your body said karataev still admiring his handiwork be nice and comfortable 
 thanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over 
 pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was saying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to translate what he said 
 what does he want the bits for said karataev make fine leg bands for us well never mind 
 and karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him oh dear muttered karataev and went away the frenchman looked at the linen considered for a moment then looked inquiringly at pierre and as if look had told him something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice 
 platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the odd bits he turned and went out 
 there look at that said karataev swaying his head people said they were not christians but they too have souls what the old folk used to say a sweating an open hand a dry close naked but yet given it back 
 karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces 
 but make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went back into the shed

 book enters the shadow 
 chapter iii 
 
 the extreme edge 
 marius had reached the halles 
 there everything was still calmer more obscure and more motionless than in the neighboring streets 
 one would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens 
 nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the rue de la chanvrerie on the side 
 it was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the corinthe barricade 
 marius directed his steps towards that red light 
 it had drawn him to the and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des precheurs he entered it 
 the insurgents sentinel who was guarding the other end did not see him 
 he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of and he walked on tiptoe in this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the rue mondetour which was as the reader will remember the only communication which enjolras had preserved with the outside world at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue mondetour 
 a little beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chanvrerie which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the and beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on their knees 
 all this was ten fathoms distant from him 
 it was the interior of the barricade 
 the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the the large barricade and the flag from him 
 marius had but a step more to take 
 then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father 
 he thought of that heroic colonel pontmercy who had been so proud a soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republic and had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious of europe drops of that same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command who had lived with his buckled his epaulets falling on his breast his cockade blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who at the expiration of twenty years had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek a smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her 
 he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war 
 he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall 
 then he shuddered 
 he thought of his sword which his grandfather had sold to a dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the gutters the war of the pavements fusillades through blows given and received in the rear it was because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvrerie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword were there if after taking possession of it at his pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel he told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his glory and that it was far better that the sword should be sold at auction sold to the man thrown among the old junk than that it should wound the side of his country 
 and then he fell to weeping bitterly 
 this was horrible 
 but what was he to do 
 live without cosette he could not 
 since she was gone he must needs die 
 had he not given her his word of honor that he would die 
 she had gone knowing that this meant that it pleased her that marius should die 
 and then it was clear that she no longer loved him since she had departed thus without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address 
 what was the good of living and why should he live now and then what should he retreat after going so far should he flee from danger after having approached it should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade slip away all in a tremble saying 
 after all i have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffices this is civil war and i shall take my leave 
 should he abandon his friends who were expecting him who were in need of him possibly who were a mere handful against an army 
 should he be untrue at once to his love to country to his word 
 should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him 
 march on you poltroon 
 thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his head 
 all at once he raised it 
 a sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in his mind 
 there is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death 
 the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more as lamentable but as superb 
 the war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul before the eye of his thought all the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him 
 he left none of them unanswered 
 let us see why should his father be indignant 
 are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty what was there that was degrading for the son of colonel pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin 
 it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is something quite different 
 the question is no longer one of sacred of a holy idea the country wails that may be but humanity applauds 
 but is it true that the country does wail 
 france bleeds but liberty smiles and in the presence of smile france forgets her wound and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war 
 civil does that mean 
 is there a foreign war is not all war between men war between brothers 
 war is qualified only by its object 
 there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and unjust war 
 until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary 
 what have we to reproach that war with 
 war does not become a disgrace the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth 
 then war whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does one form of man despise another 
 by what right should the sword of washington disown the pike of camille desmoulins 
 leonidas against the stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater the one is the defender the other the liberator 
 shall we brand every appeal to arms within a limits without taking the object into a consideration 
 then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould von blankenheim coligny hedgerow war 
 war of the streets why not 
 that was the war of ambiorix of artevelde of marnix of pelagius 
 but ambiorix fought against rome artevelde against france marnix against spain pelagius against the moors all against the foreigner 
 well the monarchy is a foreigner oppression is a stranger the right divine is a stranger 
 despotism violates the moral frontier an invasion violates the geographical frontier driving out the tyrant or driving out the english in both cases regaining possession of own territory 
 there comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices after philosophy action is required live force finishes what the idea has sketched out prometheus chained begins arostogeiton ends the encyclopedia enlightens souls the th of august electrifies them 
 after aeschylus thrasybulus after diderot danton 
 multitudes have a tendency to accept the master their mass bears witness to apathy 
 a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience 
 men must be stirred up pushed on treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance their eyes must be wounded by the true light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own this dazzling awakens them 
 hence the necessity of tocsins and wars great combatants must rise must enlighten nations with audacity and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine caesarian glory force fanaticism irresponsible power and absolute majesty a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation in their twilight splendor of these sombre triumphs of the night down with the tyrant 
 of whom are you speaking 
 do you call louis philippe the tyrant 
 no no more than louis xvi both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles are not to be parcelled out the logic of the true is rectilinear the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance no concessions then all encroachments on man should be repressed there is a divine right in louis xvi there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must be done france being always the one to begin when the master falls in france he falls everywhere 
 in short what cause is more just and consequently what war is greater than that which social truth restores her throne to liberty restores the people to the people restores sovereignty to man replaces the purple on the head of france restores equity and reason in their plenitude suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord and places the human race once more on a level with the right 
 these wars build up peace an enormous fortress of prejudices privileges superstitions lies exactions abuses violences iniquities and darkness still stands erect in this world with its towers of hatred it must be cast down 
 this monstrous mass must be made to crumble to conquer at austerlitz is grand to take the bastille is immense 
 there is no one who has not noticed it in his own soul and therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity has a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent extremities and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues treat subjects and discuss theses 
 logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of thought 
 this was the situation of marius mind 
 as he meditated thus dejected but resolute hesitating in every direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there was perceptible that which marks the last stage of expectation 
 overhead at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive 
 this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc 
 below by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the this head could be vaguely distinguished nothing could be stranger in that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and staring and its yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity 
 one would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor where it stopped

 four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though the french had offered to move him from the to the officers shed he had stayed in the shed where he was first put 
 in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physical strength and health of which he had till then been unconscious and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodino he had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the dissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of and in romantic love for natasha he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death through privation and through what he recognized in karataev 
 those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics or napoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not bound together he thought repeating words of which he found strangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matter to anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out that their name was count bezukhov 
 he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him though he understood prince thoughts somewhat differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre believed it without any mental reservation the absence of suffering the satisfaction of needs and consequent freedom in the choice of occupation that is of way of life now seemed to pierre to be indubitably highest happiness here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat drinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep of warmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of needs good food cleanliness and freedom now that he was deprived of all this seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice of occupation that is of his way of life now that that was so restricted seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying needs while great freedom in the choice of occupation such freedom as his wealth his education and his social position had given him in his own life is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation 
 all daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yet subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strong joyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks 
 when on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and the river all began to sparkle in the glad light pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased 
 that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge of languages the respect shown him by the french his simplicity his readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers with his strength which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut his gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the very qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him in the world he had lived in his strength his disdain for the comforts of life his and simplicity here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero and pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him

 the flag act first 
 as yet nothing had come 
 ten had sounded from enjolras and combeferre had gone and seated themselves carbines in hand near the outlet of the grand barricade they no longer addressed each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching 
 suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice which seemed to come from the rue rose and began to sing distinctly to the old popular air of by the light of the moon this bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock 
 
 mon nez est en larmes 
 mon ami bugeaud 
 prete moi tes gendarmes 
 pour leur dire un mot 
 
 en capote bleue 
 la poule au shako 
 voici la banlieue 
 
 my nose is in tears my friend bugeaud lend me thy gendarmes that i may say a word to them 
 with a blue capote and a chicken in his shako the banlieue 
 they pressed each hands 
 that is gavroche said enjolras 
 he is warning us said combeferre 
 a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus and gavroche bounded into the barricade all breathless saying 
 my gun 
 here they are 
 an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible 
 would you like my carbine said enjolras to the lad 
 i want a big gun replied gavroche 
 and he seized gun 
 two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment as gavroche 
 they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the vidette of the rue de la the vidette of the lane des precheurs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles 
 the rue de la chanvrerie of which a few alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke 
 each man had taken up his position for the conflict 
 insurgents among whom were enjolras combeferre courfeyrac bossuet joly bahorel and gavroche were kneeling inside the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at attentive mute ready to fire 
 six commanded by feuilly had installed themselves with their guns levelled at their shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinthe 
 several minutes passed thus then a sound of footsteps measured heavy and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous approached slowly without halt without intermission with a tranquil and terrible continuity nothing was to be heard but this 
 it was that combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a spectre one thought one heard the terrible statue legion marching onward this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped 
 it seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street 
 nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep 
 these were bayonets and confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch 
 a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting 
 all at once from the depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking shouted 
 who goes there 
 at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position was heard 
 enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone 
 the french revolution 
 fire shouted the voice 
 a flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again 
 a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade 
 the red flag fell the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff that is to say the very tip of the omnibus pole 
 bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men 
 the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing the attack had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest 
 it was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least 
 comrades shouted courfeyrac let us not waste our powder let us wait until they are in the street before replying 
 and above all said enjolras let us raise the flag again 
 he picked up the flag which had fallen precisely at his feet 
 outside the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard the troops were their arms 
 enjolras went on 
 who is there here with a bold heart 
 who will plant the flag on the barricade again 
 not a man responded 
 to mount on the barricade at the very moment when without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply death 
 the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation 
 enjolras himself felt a thrill 
 he repeated 
 does no one volunteer

 chapter xiii 
 
 the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troops and baggage trains started 
 at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim wearing shakos and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front of the sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all along the lines 
 in the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaited the order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed his eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at being left alone 
 pierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him 
 you know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospital here you may be better off than we others said pierre 
 o lord oh it will be the death of me o lord moaned the man in a louder voice 
 go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to the door of the shed 
 just as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps and these changed their familiar faces 
 the corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisoners had to be counted before being let out 
 corporal what will they do with the sick man pierre began 
 but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door the shed became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick groans 
 there it is it again said pierre to himself and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the changed face in the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to try to escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools was useless pierre knew this now one had to wait and endure he did not again go to the sick man nor turn to look at him but stood frowning by the door of the hut 
 when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one another like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also in marching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the words and in the roll of the drums 
 pass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him 
 pierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vain 
 what now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing pierre 
 pierre told him about the sick man 
 manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on pass on he continued without looking at pierre 
 but he is dying pierre again began 
 be so good shouted the captain frowning angrily 
 rattled the drums and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more 
 the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them and about three hundred men 
 the officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazan dressing grown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobacco pouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other panting and puffing the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at another a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day an official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see a third officer who by his accent was a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow 
 what are you disputing about said the major angrily what does it matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see burned down and an end of it what are you pushing for the road wide enough said he turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all 
 oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins all beyond the river and zubova and in the kremlin just look not half of it left yes i told you the whole quarter beyond the river and so it is 
 well you know burned so the use of talking said the major 
 as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard 
 ah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is and smeared with something 
 pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did he found that this was the body of a man set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot 
 go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convoy guards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man

 the flag act second 
 since they had arrived at corinthe and had begun the construction of the barricade no attention had been paid to father mabeuf m mabeuf had not quitted the mob however he had entered the of the and had seated himself behind the counter 
 there he had so to speak retreated into himself he no longer seemed to look or to think 
 courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them 
 when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one and as soon as he was addressed his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive 
 several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice 
 nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade when each had gone to take up his position for the combat there remained in the where javert was bound to the post only a single insurgent with a naked sword watching over javert and himself mabeuf 
 at the moment of the attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had as it were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room and at the instant when enjolras repeated his appeal 
 does no one volunteer the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the his presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups a shout went up 
 it is the voter 
 it is the member of the convention it is the representative of the people 
 it is probable that he did not hear them 
 he strode straight up to enjolras the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear he tore the flag from enjolras who recoiled in amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to ascend the staircase of arranged in the barricade 
 this was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried 
 off with your hats 
 at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his white locks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brow his amazed and open mouth his aged arm upholding the red banner rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of emerging from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand 
 when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible phantom erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness a supernatural and colossal form 
 there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of prodigies 
 in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag and shouted 
 long live the revolution 
 long live the republic 
 fraternity equality and death 
 those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste it was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street 
 then the same piercing voice which had shouted 
 who goes there shouted 
 retire 
 m mabeuf pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration raised the flag above his head and repeated 
 long live the republic 
 fire said the voice 
 a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the barricade 
 the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement like a log at full length with outstretched arms 
 rivulets of blood flowed beneath him 
 his aged head pale and sad seemed to be gazing at the sky 
 one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached the body with respectful awe 
 what men these regicides were said enjolras 
 courfeyrac bent down to enjolras ear 
 this is for yourself alone i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm but this man was anything rather than a regicide 
 i knew him his name was father mabeuf 
 i do not know what was the matter with him but he was a brave blockhead 
 just look at his head 
 the head of a blockhead and the heart of a brutus replied enjolras 
 then he raised his voice 
 citizens 
 this is the example which the old give to the young we hesitated he came 
 we were drawing back he advanced 
 this is what those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear 
 this aged man is august in the eyes of his country he has had a long life and a magnificent death 
 now let us place the body under cover that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father living and may his presence in our midst render the barricade impregnable 
 a murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words 
 enjolras bent down raised the old head and fierce as he was he kissed him on the brow then throwing wide his arms and handling this dead man with tender precaution as though he feared to hurt it he removed his coat showed the bloody holes in it to all and said 
 this is our flag now

 chapter xiv 
 
 through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners marched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles 
 at the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them to the right where the kaluga road turns near neskuchny endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais corps which had started before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the stone bridge were troops and transport 
 troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the vanguard of army was already emerging from the great ordynka street 
 when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking more than an hour to do so and came out upon the square where the streets of the transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway from all sides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels the tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums 
 to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the house against which pierre was leaning 
 what crowds just look at the crowds loaded goods even on the cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed just see what the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind in the cart why those are settings taken from some icons by heaven oh the rascals see how that fellow has loaded himself up he can hardly walk good lord even grabbed those chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavens fighting 
 right hit him on the snout on his snout like this we get away before evening look look there why that must be own see what horses and the monograms with a crown like a portable house that dropped his sack and see it fighting again a woman with a baby and not either yes i dare say the way let you pass just look no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are in carriages see how comfortably settled themselves 
 again as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to his stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts closely squeezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaring colors who were shouting something in shrill voices 
 from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him as if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to receive impressions that might weaken it 
 the vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldiers wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition carts more soldiers and now and then women 
 pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement 
 all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly they all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight white teeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the face when the drums were beating 
 it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emerged onto the kaluga road 
 they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sun began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their rest they all appeared angry and dissatisfied for a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting could be heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword 
 it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey 
 during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration 
 from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations 
 this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian to the noncommissioned excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions but which be had not felt during his imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it 
 he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades 
 neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in moscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of their present situation 
 the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yet come pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back 
 pierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad laughter so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean 
 laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive what me me my immortal soul and he laughed till tears started to his eyes 
 a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away from the inquisitive man and looked around him 
 the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseen before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions

 gavroche would have done better to accept enjolras carbine 
 they threw a long black shawl of widow over father mabeuf six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and bore it with bared heads with solemn slowness to the large table in the 
 these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood 
 when the corpse passed near javert who was still impassive enjolras said to the spy 
 it will be your turn presently 
 during all this time little gavroche who alone had not quitted his post but had remained on guard thought he espied some men stealthily approaching the barricade 
 all at once he shouted 
 look out 
 courfeyrac enjolras jean prouvaire combeferre joly bahorel bossuet and all the rest ran tumultuously from the it was almost too late 
 they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above the barricade 
 municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut thrusting before them the urchin who retreated but did not flee 
 the moment was critical 
 it was that first redoubtable moment of inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike a second more and the barricade would have been taken 
 bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering and killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun the second killed bahorel with a blow from his bayonet 
 another had already overthrown courfeyrac who was shouting 
 follow me 
 the largest of all a sort of colossus marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed the urchin took in his arms immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and fired 
 no discharge followed gun was not loaded 
 the municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child 
 before the bayonet had touched gavroche the gun slipped from the grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back a second bullet struck the other guard who had assaulted courfeyrac in the breast and laid him low on the pavement 
 this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade

 chapter xv 
 
 in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga road kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace 
 soon after that a report was received from guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutuzov to carry out suggestion kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier 
 by a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturov that same modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses on batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the wars from austerlitz to the year at austerlitz he remained last at the augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against whole army in smolensk at the malakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolensk held out all day long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturov kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and the quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino became the greatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said 
 it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit 
 it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part the man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working 
 on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and stopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsive movement reached position apparently in order to give battle suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kaluga road and began to enter forminsk where only broussier had been till then at that time dokhturov had under his command besides detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin 
 on the evening of october seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four days previously that same evening a house serf who had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town some cossacks of detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to borovsk from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected direction along the kaluga road dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do he had been ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there ermolov wished to act on his own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he must have instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff 
 for this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering a written report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received the dispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses

 the barrel of powder 
 marius still concealed in the turn of the rue mondetour had witnessed shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat 
 but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss 
 in the presence of the imminence of the peril in the presence of the death of m mabeuf that melancholy enigma in the presence of bahorel killed and courfeyrac shouting 
 follow me of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the conflict his two pistols in hand with his first shot he had saved gavroche and with the second delivered courfeyrac 
 amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen gun in hand rearing themselves to more than half the height of their bodies 
 they already covered more than of the barrier but they did not leap into the enclosure as though wavering in the fear of some trap 
 they gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a den 
 the light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets their caps and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces 
 marius had no longer any weapons he had flung away his discharged pistols after firing them but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in the near the door 
 as he turned half round gazing in that direction a soldier took aim at him 
 at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it this was done by some one who had darted young workman in velvet trousers 
 the shot sped traversed the hand and possibly also the workman since he fell but the ball did not strike marius all this which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke marius who was entering the hardly noticed still he had in a confused way perceived that aimed at him and the hand which had blocked it and he had heard the discharge but in moments like this the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated and one pauses for nothing 
 one feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still and all is cloud 
 the insurgents surprised but not terrified had rallied enjolras had shouted 
 wait 
 fire at random in the first confusion they might in fact wound each other the majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story and to the attic windows whence they commanded the assailants 
 the most determined with enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire and combeferre had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade 
 all this was accomplished without haste with that strange and threatening gravity which precedes engagements 
 they took aim point blank on both sides 
 they were so close that they could talk together without raising their voices 
 when they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of darting forth an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said 
 lay down your arms 
 fire replied enjolras 
 the two discharges took place at the same moment and all disappeared in smoke 
 an acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak dull groans 
 when the smoke cleared away the combatants on both sides could be seen to be thinned out but still in the same positions reloading in silence 
 all at once a thundering voice was heard shouting 
 be off with you or blow up the barricade 
 all turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded 
 marius had entered the and had seized the barrel of powder then he had taken advantage of the smoke and the sort of obscure mist which filled the entrenched enclosure to glide along the barricade as far as that cage of where the torch was fixed to tear it from the torch to replace it by the barrel of powder to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel which was instantly staved in with a sort of horrible this had cost marius but the time necessary to stoop and rise again and now all national guards municipal guards officers soldiers huddled at the other extremity of the barricade gazed stupidly at him as he stood with his foot on the stones his torch in his hand his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder and giving vent to that startling cry 
 be off with you or blow up the barricade 
 marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old 
 blow up the barricade said a sergeant and yourself with it 
 marius retorted 
 and myself also 
 and he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder 
 but there was no longer any one on the barrier 
 the assailants abandoning their dead and wounded flowed back and in disorder towards the extremity of the street and there were again lost in the night 
 it was a headlong flight 
 the barricade was free

 it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky muddy road bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins he entered a dark passage 
 the general on duty quick very important said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage 
 he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you should wake the captain first 
 but this is very important from general dokhturov said bolkhovitinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark 
 the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody 
 your honor your honor a courier 
 what that from whom came a sleepy voice 
 from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk said bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn 
 the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself 
 i like waking him he said fumbling for something he is very ill perhaps this is only a rumor 
 here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give it at once to the general on duty 
 wait a moment light a candle you damned rascal where do you always hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching himself to the orderly this was shcherbinin adjutant found it found it he added 
 the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick 
 oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust 
 by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw youthful face as he held the candle and the face of another man who was still asleep this was konovnitsyn 
 when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up first blue and then red shcherbinin lit the tallow candle from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve 
 who gave the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelope 
 the news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks and the scouts all say the same thing 
 nothing to be done have to wake him said shcherbinin rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir to the general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him 
 and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance 
 well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurry blinking at the light 
 while listening to the report konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples and donned his cap 
 did you get here quickly let us go to his highness 
 konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it but must only attend to own work and he did his work giving his whole strength to the task 
 peter petrovich konovnitsyn like dokhturov seems to have been included merely for sake in the list of the heroes of the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches like dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in battle he was always under fire so that kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front and like dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the most essential part of the machine 
 coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frowned partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen who ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped 
 and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters until konovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must go to see his highness

 end of the verses of jean prouvaire 
 all flocked around marius 
 courfeyrac flung himself on his neck 
 here you are 
 what luck said combeferre 
 you came in opportunely ejaculated bossuet 
 if it had not been for you i should have been dead began courfeyrac again 
 if it had not been for you i should have been gobbled up added gavroche 
 marius asked 
 where is the chief 
 you are he said enjolras 
 marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long now it was a whirlwind 
 this whirlwind which was within him produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away it seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life his two luminous months of joy and love ending abruptly at that frightful precipice cosette lost to him that barricade m mabeuf getting himself killed for the republic himself the leader of the insurgents all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare he was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was real 
 marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen 
 he had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not understand 
 in the mists which enveloped his thoughts he did not recognize javert who bound to his post had not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge 
 marius had not even seen him 
 in the meanwhile the assailants did not stir they could be heard marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not venture into it either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt 
 the insurgents had posted sentinels and some of them who were medical students set about caring for the wounded 
 they had thrown the tables out of the with the exception of the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges and of the one on which lay father mabeuf they had added them to the barricade and had replaced them in the with mattresses from the bed of the widow hucheloup and her servants 
 on these mattresses they had laid the wounded 
 as for the three poor creatures who inhabited corinthe no one knew what had become of them they were finally found however hidden in the cellar 
 a poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade 
 the roll was called 
 one of the insurgents was missing 
 and who was it one of the dearest 
 one of the most valiant 
 jean prouvaire he was sought among the wounded he was not there 
 he was sought among the dead he was not there 
 he was evidently a prisoner combeferre said to enjolras 
 they have our friend we have their agent 
 are you set on the death of that spy 
 yes replied enjolras but less so than on the life of jean prouvaire 
 this took place in the near post 
 well resumed combeferre i am going to fasten my handkerchief to my cane and go as a flag of truce to offer to exchange our man for theirs 
 listen said enjolras laying his hand on arm 
 at the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms 
 they heard a manly voice shout 
 vive la france 
 long live france 
 long live the future 
 they recognized the voice of prouvaire 
 a flash passed a report rang out 
 silence fell again 
 they have killed him exclaimed combeferre 
 enjolras glanced at javert and said to him 
 your friends have just shot you

 chapter xvii 
 
 kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed without undressing he generally remained awake thinking 
 so he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head on his plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into the darkness 
 since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tarutino battle and of the day before it which kutuzov remembered with pain must he thought have some effect on others too 
 they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fall of itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the tree is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of the guerrillas kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait 
 they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are like children from whom one get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but not what is needed now 
 and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless 
 the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was mortal or not had hung over head for a whole month on the one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just like the younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in sections against petersburg or against him or to outflank him he thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutuzov even imagined that army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane convulsive stampede of army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which made possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete extermination of the french report about division the guerrillas reports of distress in army rumors of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only suppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not to kutuzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attach to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only customary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael the reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he alone foresaw was his one desire 
 on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that 
 there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll konovnitsyn and bolkhovitinov 
 eh there come in come in what news the field marshal called out to them 
 while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance of the news 
 who brought it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle was lit struck toll by its cold severity 
 there can be no doubt about it your highness 
 call him in call him here 
 kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind 
 tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in his low aged voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest come nearer nearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh 
 bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report 
 speak quicker quicker torture me kutuzov interrupted him 
 bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent awaiting instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of the room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there 
 o lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands russia is saved i thank thee o lord and he wept

 the agony of death after the agony of life 
 a peculiarity of this species of war is that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position either because they fear ambushes or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets 
 the insurgents whole attention had been directed therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always menaced and there the struggle would infallibly recommence but marius thought of the little barricade and went thither it was deserted and guarded only by the which trembled between the moreover the mondetour alley and the branches of the rue de la petite truanderie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm 
 as marius was withdrawing after concluding his inspection he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness 
 monsieur marius 
 he started for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumet 
 only the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath 
 he looked about him but saw no one 
 marius thought he had been mistaken that it was an illusion added by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him 
 he advanced a step in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay 
 monsieur marius repeated the voice 
 this time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly he looked and saw nothing 
 at your feet said the voice 
 he bent down and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself towards him 
 it was crawling along the pavement 
 it was this that had spoken to him 
 the allowed him to distinguish a blouse torn trousers of coarse velvet bare feet and something which resembled a pool of blood 
 marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him 
 you do not recognize me 
 no 
 eponine 
 marius bent hastily down 
 it was in fact that unhappy child she was dressed in clothes 
 how come you here 
 what are you doing here 
 i am dying said she 
 there are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings marius cried out with a start 
 you are wounded 
 wait i will carry you into the room 
 they will attend to you there 
 is it serious 
 how must i take hold of you in order not to hurt you 
 where do you suffer 
 help 
 my god but why did you come hither 
 and he tried to pass his arm under her in order to raise her 
 she uttered a feeble cry 
 have i hurt you asked marius 
 a little 
 but i only touched your hand 
 she raised her hand to marius and in the middle of that hand marius saw a black hole 
 what is the matter with your hand said he 
 it is pierced 
 pierced 
 yes 
 what with 
 a bullet 
 how 
 did you see a gun aimed at you 
 yes and a hand stopping it 
 it was mine 
 marius was seized with a shudder 
 what madness 
 poor child 
 but so much the better if that is all it is nothing let me carry you to a bed 
 they will dress your wound one does not die of a pierced hand 
 she murmured 
 the bullet traversed my hand but it came out through my back it is useless to remove me from this spot 
 i will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon 
 sit down near me on this stone 
 he obeyed she laid her head on marius knees and without looking at him she said 
 oh 
 how good this is 
 how comfortable this is 
 there i no longer suffer 
 she remained silent for a moment then she turned her face with an effort and looked at marius 
 do you know what monsieur marius 
 it puzzled me because you entered that garden it was stupid because it was i who showed you that house and then i ought to have said to myself that a young man like you 
 she paused and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind she resumed with a heartrending smile 
 you thought me ugly you 
 she continued 
 you see you are lost 
 now no one can get out of the barricade it was i who led you here by the way 
 you are going to die i count upon that 
 and yet when i saw them taking aim at you i put my hand on the muzzle of the gun 
 how queer it is 
 but it was because i wanted to die before you 
 when i received that bullet i dragged myself here no one saw me no one picked me up i was waiting for you i said 
 so he is not coming 
 oh if you only knew 
 i bit my blouse i suffered so 
 now i am well do you remember the day i entered your chamber and when i looked at myself in your mirror and the day when i came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen 
 how the birds sang 
 that was a long time ago 
 you gave me a hundred sous and i said to you i want your money 
 i hope you picked up your coin you are not rich 
 i did not think to tell you to pick it up the sun was shining bright and it was not cold 
 do you remember monsieur marius 
 oh 
 how happy i am 
 every one is going to die 
 she had a mad grave and air 
 her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat 
 as she talked she pressed her pierced hand to her breast where there was another hole and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood like a jet of wine from an open 
 marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion 
 oh she resumed it is coming again i am stifling 
 she caught up her blouse and bit it and her limbs stiffened on the pavement 
 at that moment the young crow executed by little gavroche resounded through the barricade 
 the child had mounted a table to load his gun and was singing gayly the song then so popular 
 en voyant lafayette on beholding lafayette le gendarme repete the gendarme repeats sauvons nous sauvons nous 
 let us flee let us flee 
 sauvons nous let us flee 
 eponine raised herself and listened then she murmured 
 it is he 
 and turning to marius 
 my brother is here 
 he must not see me 
 he would scold me 
 your brother inquired marius who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the thenardiers which his father had bequeathed to him who is your brother 
 that little fellow 
 the one who is singing 
 yes 
 marius made a movement 
 oh go away said she it will not be long now 
 she was sitting almost upright but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs 
 at intervals the death rattle interrupted her 
 she put her face as near that of marius as possible 
 she added with a strange expression 
 listen i do not wish to play you a trick 
 i have a letter in my pocket for you 
 i was told to put it in the post 
 i kept it i did not want to have it reach you 
 but perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently 
 take your letter 
 she grasped marius hand convulsively with her pierced hand but she no longer seemed to feel her sufferings 
 she put marius hand in the pocket of her blouse 
 there in fact marius felt a paper 
 take it said she 
 marius took the letter 
 she made a sign of satisfaction and contentment 
 now for my trouble promise me 
 and she stopped 
 what asked marius 
 promise me 
 i promise 
 promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am shall feel it 
 she dropped her head again on marius knees and her eyelids closed he thought the poor soul had departed 
 eponine remained motionless all at once at the very moment when marius fancied her asleep forever she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world 
 and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you 
 she tried to smile once more and expired

 chapter xviii 
 
 from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all activity was directed toward restraining his troops by authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers or encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of kaluga a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible 
 everywhere kutuzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction 
 historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino and and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces 
 but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his way the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin how could that army which had found abundant supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them how could that army recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by russians such as those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze 
 that army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it were the chemical elements of dissolution 
 the members of what had once been an army napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled without knowing whither each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious 
 so it came about that at the council at when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the soldier mouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even napoleon could say anything against that truth which they all recognized 
 but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee an external shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came in due time it was what the french called le hourra de 
 the day after the council at napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the cossacks did not capture napoleon then what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army the booty on which the cossacks fell here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving the men disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape 
 when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleon with his stomach understood that hint not feeling his former agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued orders as the historians tell us to retreat by the smolensk road 
 that napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also

 gavroche as a profound calculator of distances 
 marius kept his promise 
 he dropped a kiss on that livid brow where the icy perspiration stood in beads 
 this was no infidelity to cosette it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soul 
 it was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which eponine had given him 
 he had immediately felt that it was an event of weight 
 he was impatient to read it the heart of man is so constituted that the unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when marius began to think of unfolding this paper 
 he laid her gently on the ground and went away 
 something told him that he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body 
 he drew near to a candle in the it was a small note folded and sealed with a elegant care 
 the address was in a hand and ran 
 to monsieur monsieur marius pontmercy at m rue de la verrerie no 
 he broke the seal and read 
 my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de arme no in a week we shall be in england 
 cosette 
 june th 
 such was the innocence of their love that marius was not even acquainted with handwriting 
 what had taken place may be related in a few words 
 eponine had been the cause of everything 
 after the evening of the d of june she had cherished a double idea to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the rue plumet and to separate marius and cosette 
 she had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman while eponine disguised herself like a man it was she who had conveyed to jean valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning 
 leave your house 
 jean valjean had in fact returned home and had said to cosette 
 we set out this evening and we go to the rue de arme with toussaint next week we shall be in london 
 cosette utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of lines to marius 
 but how was she to get the letter to the post she never went out alone and toussaint surprised at such a commission would certainly show the letter to m fauchelevent in this dilemma cosette had caught sight through the fence of eponine in clothes who now prowled incessantly around the garden cosette had called to this young workman and had handed him five francs and the letter saying 
 carry this letter immediately to its address 
 eponine had put the letter in her pocket 
 the next day on the th of june she went to quarters to inquire for marius not for the purpose of delivering the letter thing which every jealous and loving soul will see there she had waited for marius or at least for courfeyrac still for the purpose of seeing 
 when courfeyrac had told her we are going to the barricades an idea flashed through her mind to fling herself into that death as she would have done into any other and to thrust marius into it also 
 she had followed courfeyrac had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction and quite certain since marius had received no warning and since she had intercepted the letter that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening she had betaken herself to the rue plumet had there awaited marius and had sent him in the name of his friends the appeal which would she thought lead him to the barricade 
 she reckoned on marius despair when he should fail to find cosette she was not mistaken she had returned to the rue de la chanvrerie herself 
 what she did there the reader has just seen 
 she died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death and who say no one shall have him 
 marius covered letter with kisses 
 so she loved him for one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now then he said to himself 
 she is going away 
 her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage nothing is changed in our fates 
 dreamers like marius are subject to supreme attacks of dejection and desperate resolves are the result the fatigue of living is insupportable death is sooner over with then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil 
 to inform cosette of his death and send her a final farewell and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation that poor child brother and son 
 he had a about him the same one which had contained the in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette 
 he tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil 
 our marriage was impossible 
 i asked my grandfather he refused i have no fortune neither hast thou 
 i hastened to thee thou wert no longer there 
 thou knowest the promise that i gave thee i shall keep it 
 i die 
 i love thee 
 when thou readest this my soul will be near thee and thou wilt smile 
 having nothing wherewith to seal this letter he contented himself with folding the paper in four and added the address 
 to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent at m rue de arme no 
 having folded the letter he stood in thought for a moment drew out his again opened it and wrote with the same pencil these four lines on the first page 
 my name is marius pontmercy 
 carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des no in the marais 
 he put his pocketbook back in his pocket then he called gavroche 
 the gamin at the sound of marius voice ran up to him with his merry and devoted air 
 will you do something for me 
 anything said gavroche 
 good god if it had not been for you i should have been done for 
 do you see this letter 
 yes 
 take it 
 leave the barricade instantly gavroche began to scratch his ear uneasily and morning you will deliver it at its address to mademoiselle cosette at m rue de arme no 
 the heroic child replied 
 well but in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken and i shall not be there 
 the barricade will not be attacked until daybreak according to all appearances and will not be taken before noon 
 the fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade had in fact been prolonged 
 it was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats which are always followed by an increase of rage 
 well said gavroche what if i were to go and carry your letter 
 it will be too late 
 the barricade will probably be blockaded all the streets will be guarded and you will not be able to get out go at once 
 gavroche could think of no reply to this and stood there in indecision scratching his ear sadly 
 all at once he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements which were common with him 
 all right said he 
 and he started off at a run through mondetour lane 
 an idea had occurred to gavroche which had brought him to a decision but he had not mentioned it for fear that marius might offer some objection to it 
 this was the idea 
 it is barely midnight the rue de arme is not far off i will go and deliver the letter at once and i shall get back in time

 book thirteen 
 chapter xix 
 
 a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move 
 the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was too far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today i shall get to a place miles off where i shall rest and spend the night and during the first journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd 
 for the french retreating along the old smolensk road the final goal their native land was too remote and their immediate goal was smolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land 
 coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy there was another cause binding them together their great numbers as with the physical law of gravity their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation 
 each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolensk their goal drew each of them in the same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement to which the french were directing all their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition 
 a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes 
 of the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this when the flight of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined what konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to cut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all clamored for action 
 kutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief to prevent an attack 
 he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the road losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying beast 
 ermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the french near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope 
 and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked trying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousands of men 
 but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army closing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily melting away to pursue its fatal path to smolensk

 book rue de arme 
 chapter i 
 
 a drinker is a babbler 
 what are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of the soul 
 man is a depth still greater than the people jean valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval every sort of gulf had opened again within him 
 he also was trembling like paris on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution a few hours had sufficed to bring this about 
 his destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom 
 of him also as well as of paris it might have been said 
 two principles are face to face 
 the white angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss 
 which of the two will hurl the other over 
 who will carry the day 
 on the evening preceding this same th of june jean valjean accompanied by cosette and toussaint had installed himself in the rue de arme 
 a change awaited him there 
 cosette had not quitted the rue plumet without making an effort at resistance 
 for the first time since they had lived side by side will and the will of jean valjean had proved to be distinct and had been in opposition at least if they had not clashed there had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other the abrupt advice 
 leave your house hurled at jean valjean by a stranger had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory he thought that he had been traced and followed 
 cosette had been obliged to give way 
 both had arrived in the rue de arme without opening their lips and without uttering a word each being absorbed in his own personal preoccupation jean valjean so uneasy that he did not notice sadness cosette so sad that she did not notice jean uneasiness 
 jean valjean had taken toussaint with him a thing which he had never done in his previous absences 
 he perceived the possibility of not returning to the rue plumet and he could neither leave toussaint behind nor confide his secret to her 
 besides he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy 
 treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity 
 now toussaint as though she had been destined to be jean servant was not curious she stammered in her peasant dialect of barneville 
 i am made so i do my work the rest is no affair of mine 
 in this departure from the rue plumet which had been almost a flight jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise baptized by cosette the inseparable full trunks would have required porters and porters are witnesses a fiacre had been summoned to the door on the rue de babylone and they had taken their departure 
 it was with difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to pack up a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles cosette had taken only her portfolio and her 
 jean valjean with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only at dusk which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius they had arrived in the rue de arme after night had fully fallen 
 they had gone to bed in silence 
 the lodgings in the rue de arme were situated on a back court on the second floor and were composed of two a and a kitchen adjoining the with a garret where there was a and which fell to share the was an antechamber as well and separated the two bedrooms 
 the apartment was provided with all necessary utensils 
 people confidence as foolishly as they lose it human nature is so constituted 
 hardly had jean valjean reached the rue de arme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated there are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind 
 an obscure street peaceable inhabitants 
 jean valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city dimly lighted at and is so to speak incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old which hold their peace like ancients as they are there was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street 
 jean valjean drew his breath once more there 
 how could he be found there 
 his first care was to place the inseparable beside him 
 he slept well 
 night brings wisdom we may add night soothes on the following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay he thought the charming though it was hideous furnished with an old round table a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror a dilapidated and several plain chairs which were encumbered with packages 
 in one of these packages jean uniform of a national guard was visible through a rent 
 as for cosette she had had toussaint take some broth to her room and did not make her appearance until evening 
 about five toussaint who was going and coming and busying herself with the tiny establishment set on the table a cold chicken which cosette out of deference to her father consented to glance at 
 that done cosette under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache had bade jean valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber jean valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite and with his elbows on the table having gradually recovered his serenity had regained possession of his sense of security 
 while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice noticed in a confused way stammering words as she said to him 
 monsieur there is something going on they are fighting in paris 
 but absorbed in a throng of inward calculations he had paid no heed to it 
 to tell the truth he had not heard her he rose and began to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door growing ever more serene 
 with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts not that he was troubled by this headache a little nervous crisis a young fit of sulks the cloud of a moment there would be nothing left of it in a day or two but he meditated on the future and as was his habit he thought of it with pleasure 
 after all he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course at certain hours everything seems impossible at others everything appears easy jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours they generally succeed the bad ones as day follows night by virtue of that law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature and which superficial minds call antithesis in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some time past this very fact that he had seen many shadows made him begin to perceive a little azure 
 to have quitted the rue plumet without complications or incidents was one good step already accomplished perhaps it would be wise to go abroad if only for a few months and to set out for london 
 well they would go 
 what difference did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he had cosette beside him 
 cosette was his nation 
 cosette sufficed for his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind he was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings and he was fully entered on optimism 
 cosette was by his side she seemed to be his an optical illusion which every one has experienced he arranged in his own mind with all sorts of felicitous devices his departure for england with cosette and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased in the perspective of his revery 
 as he paced to and fro with long strides his glance suddenly encountered something strange 
 in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard he saw the four lines which follow 
 my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de arme no in a week we shall be in england 
 cosette 
 june th 
 jean valjean halted perfectly haggard 
 cosette on her arrival had placed her on the sideboard in front of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned and which she had given in charge of the young workman in the rue plumet the writing had been printed off on the blotter 
 the mirror reflected the writing 
 the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical image so that the writing reversed on the blotter was righted in the mirror and presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening 
 it was simple and withering 
 jean valjean stepped up to the mirror 
 he read the four lines again but he did not believe them 
 they produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of lightning 
 it was a hallucination it was impossible 
 it was not so 
 little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at and the consciousness of the reality returned to him 
 he caught up the blotter and said 
 it comes from there 
 he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl and he saw no sense in it 
 then he said to himself but this signifies nothing there is nothing written here and he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief 
 who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants 
 the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions 
 he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe 
 all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he beheld the vision 
 there were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness 
 this time it was no mirage the recurrence of a vision is a reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in the mirror 
 he understood 
 jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old beside the buffet with drooping head and glassy eyes in utter bewilderment 
 he told himself that it was plain that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that to some one 
 then he heard his soul which had become terrible once more give vent to a dull roar in the gloom try then the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage 
 strange and sad to say at that very moment marius had not yet received letter chance had treacherously carried it 
 to jean valjean before delivering it to marius 
 up to that day jean valjean had not been vanquished by trial 
 he had been subjected to fearful proofs no violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey and had raged against him he had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man had yielded up his liberty risked his head lost everything suffered everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr his conscience inured to every assault of destiny might have appeared to be forever impregnable 
 well any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment 
 it was because of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him this was the most terrible 
 never had such pincers seized him hitherto 
 he felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities 
 he felt the plucking at the strange chord alas the supreme trial let us say rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being 
 poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than as a father but we have already remarked above that into this paternity the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love he loved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest that sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and virgin 
 let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated 
 no marriage was possible between them not even that of souls and yet it is certain that their destinies were wedded 
 with the exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of that which may be loved the passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green growths tender green or dark green which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty 
 in short and we have insisted on it more than once all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum total was a lofty virtue ended in rendering jean valjean a father to cosette a strange father forged from the grandfather the son the brother and the husband that existed in jean valjean a father in whom there was included even a mother a father who loved cosette and adored her and who held that child as his light his home his family his country his paradise 
 thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come that she was escaping from him that she was slipping from his hands that she was gliding from him like a cloud like water when he had before his eyes this crushing proof 
 another is the goal of her heart another is the wish of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anything but her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he said to himself 
 she is going away from me the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility to have done all that he had done for the purpose of ending like this and the very idea of being nothing 
 then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot 
 he felt even in the very roots of his hair the immense reawakening of egotism and the i in this abyss howled 
 there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil a despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside and breaking certain profound elements which in some cases are the very man himself 
 grief when it attains this shape is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience these are fatal crises 
 few among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty 
 when the limit of endurance is overstepped the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted jean valjean took the blotter again and convinced himself afresh he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes over those four unobjectionable lines and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was crumbling away 
 he examined this revelation athwart the exaggerations of revery with an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when a calmness reaches the coldness of the statue 
 he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his having a suspicion of the fact he recalled his fears of the preceding summer so foolishly dissipated he recognized the precipice it was still the same only jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at the bottom of it 
 the unprecedented and thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiving it 
 all the light of his life had departed while he still fancied that he beheld the sun 
 his instinct did not hesitate 
 he put together certain circumstances certain dates certain blushes and certain pallors on part and he said to himself 
 it is he 
 the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses its aim 
 he struck marius with his first conjecture he did not know the name but he found the man instantly he distinctly perceived in the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories the unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretched seeker of love adventures that idler of romance that idiot that coward for it is cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves them 
 after he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at the bottom of this situation and that everything proceeded from that quarter he jean valjean the regenerated man the man who had so labored over his soul the man who had made so many efforts to resolve all life all misery and all unhappiness into love looked into his own breast and there beheld a spectre hate 
 great griefs contain something of dejection 
 they discourage one with existence 
 the man into whom they enter feels something within him withdraw from him 
 in his youth their visits are lugubrious later on they are sinister 
 alas if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is hot when the hair is black when the head is erect on the body like the flame on the torch when the roll of destiny still retains its full thickness when the heart full of desirable love still possesses beats which can be returned to it when one has time for redress when all women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before one when the force of life is complete what is it in old age when the years hasten on growing ever paler to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb 
 while he was meditating toussaint entered 
 jean valjean rose and asked her 
 in what quarter is it 
 do you know 
 toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him 
 what is it sir 
 jean valjean began again 
 did you not tell me that just now that there is fighting going on 
 ah yes sir replied toussaint 
 it is in the direction of 
 there is a mechanical movement which comes to us unconsciously from the most profound depths of our thought 
 it was no doubt under the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the street 
 bareheaded he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house he seemed to be listening 
 night had come

 book fourteen 
 chapter i 
 
 the battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history 
 all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases 
 strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor having quarreled with another collects an army fights his army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the facts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation should oblige that whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated 
 so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it is to our own day all wars serve to confirm this rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of prussia 
 but then in the french gain a victory near moscow moscow is taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the hands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed army is impossible 
 after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist what does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of all known wars 
 the period of the campaign of from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else 
 the french historians describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army except the cavalry the artillery and the transport there was no forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it 
 the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them but burned it instead 
 let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone on for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring to conceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel 
 the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the russian people those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event 
 after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages the retreats after battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed retreat the burning of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure of transports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules 
 napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of his rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules as if there were any rules for killing people in spite of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules in spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroit thrust en prime and so on the cudgel of the war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose and fell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the french till the whole invasion had perished 
 and it is well for a people who do not as the french did in salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous conqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion

 of the true greatness of kingdoms estates 
 the speech of themistocles the athenian which was haughty and arrogant in taking so much to himself had been a grave and wise observation and censure applied at large to others desired at a feast to touch a lute he said he could not fiddle but yet he could make a small town a great city these words holpen a little with a metaphor may express two differing abilities in those mat deal in business of estate for if a true survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen there may be found though rarely those which can make a small state great and yet cannot fiddle as on the other side there will be found a great many that can fiddle very cunningly but yet are so far from being able to make a small state great as their gift lieth the other way to bring a great and flourishing estate to ruin and decay and certainly those degenerate arts and shifts whereby many counsellor and governors gain both favour with their masters and estimation with the vulgar deserve no better name then fiddling being things rather pleasing for the time and graceful to themselves only than tending to the weal and advancement of the state which they serve 
 there are also no doubt counsellor and governors which may be held sufficient negotus pares able to manage affairs and to keep them from precipices and manifest inconveniences which nevertheless are far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate in power means and fortune but be the workmen what they may be let us speak of the work that is the true greatness of kingdoms and estates and the means thereof an argument fit for great and mighty princes to have in their hand to the end that neither by their forces they lose themselves in vain enterprises nor on the other side by undervaluing them they descend to fearful and pusillanimous counsels 
 
 the greatness of an estate in bulk and territory doth fall under measure and the 
 greatness of finances and revenue doth fall under computation the population may 
 appear by musters and the number and greatness of cities and towns by cards and 
 maps but yet there is not anything amongst civil affairs more subject to error than 
 the right valuation and true judgement concerning the power and forces of an estate 
 
 the kingdom of heaven is compared not to any great kernel or nut but to a grain 
 of which is one of the least grains but hath in it a property and spirit hastily to get up and spread so are there states great in territory and yet not 
 apt to enlarge or command and some that have but a small dimension of stem and yet apt to be the foundations of great monarchies 
 
 walled towns stored arsenals and armouries goodly races of horse chariots of war elephants ordnance artillery and the like all this is but a sheep in a 
 skin except the breed and disposition of the people be stout and warlike nay number itself in armies importeth not much where the people is of weak courage for as virgil saith it never troubles a wolf how many the sheep be the army of the persians in the plains of arbela was such a vast sea of people as it did somewhat astonish the commanders in army who came to him therefore and wished him to set upon them by night but he answered he would not pilfer the victory 
 and the defeat was easy when tigranes the armenian being encamped upon a hill with four hundred thousand men discovered the army of the romans being not above fourteen thousand marching towards him he made himself merry with it and said yonder men are too many for an ambassage and too few for a fight but before the sun set he found them enough to give him the chase with infinite slaughter many are the examples of the great odds between number and courage so that a man may truly make a judgement that the principal point of greatness in any state is to have a race of military men neither is money the sinews of war as it is trivially said where the sinews of arms in base and effeminate people are failing for solon said well to croesus when in ostentation he showed him his gold sir if any other come that hath better iron than you he will be master of all this gold therefore let any prince or state think soberly of his forces except his militia of natives be of good and valiant soldiers 
 
 and let princes on the other side that have subjects of martial disposition know 
 their own strength unless they be otherwise wanting unto themselves as for mercenary forces which is the help in this case all examples show that whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them he may spread his feathers for a time but he will mew them soon after 
 
 the blessing of judah and issachar will never meet that the same people or nation 
 should be both the whelp and the ass between burthens neither will it be 
 that a people with taxes should ever become valiant and martial it is 
 true that taxes levied by consent of the estate do abate courage less as 
 it hath been seen notably in the excises of the low countries and in some degree 
 in the subsidies of england for you must note that we speak now of the heart and not of the purse so that although the same tribute and tax laid by consent or by imposing be all one to the purse yet it works diversely upon the courage so that you may conclude that no people with tribute is fit for empire 
 let states that aim at greatness take heed how their nobility and gentlemen do 
 multiply too fast for that maketh the common subject grow to be a peasant and base swain driven out of heart and in effect but the labourer 
 even as you may see in coppice woods if you leave your staddles too thick you shall never have clean underwood but shrubs and bushes so in countries if the gentlemen be too many the commons will be base and you will bring it to that that not the hundred poll will be fit for an helmet especially as to the infantry which is the nerve of an army and so there will be 
 great population and little strength this which i speak of hath been nowhere 
 better seen then by comparing of england and france whereof england though far less in territory and population hath been nevertheless an overmatch in regard the middle people of england make good soldiers which the peasants of france do not and herein the device of king henry the seventh whereof i have spoken largely in the history of his life was profound and admirable in making farms and houses of husbandry of a standard that is maintained with such a proportion of land unto mem as may breed a subject to live in convenient plenty and no servile condition and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings 
 and thus indeed you shall attain to character which he gives to ancient italy terra potens arrnis atque ubere glebae neither is that state which for anything 
 i know is almost peculiar to england and hardly to be found anywhere else except 
 it be perhaps in poland to be passed over i mean die state of free servants and 
 attendants upon noblemen and gentlemen which are no ways inferior unto the yeomanry for arms 
 and therefore out of all question the splendour and magnificence and 
 great retinues and hospitality of noblemen and gentlemen received into custom doth much conduce unto martial greatness whereas contrariwise the close and reserved living of noblemen and gentlemen causeth a penury of military forces 
 
 by all means it is to be procured that the trunk of tree of monarchy be great enough to bear the branches and the boughs that is that the natural subjects of the crown or state bear a sufficient proportion to the stronger subjects that they govern therefore all states that are liberal of naturalisation towards strangers are fit for empire for to think that an handful of people can with the greatest courage and policy in the world embrace too large extent of dominion it may hold for a time but it will fail suddenly the spartans were a nice people in point of naturalisation whereby while they kept their compass they stood firm but when they did spread and their boughs were becoming too great for their stem they became a windfall upon the sudden never any state was in this point so open to receive strangers into their body as were the romans 
 therefore it sorted with them accordingly for they grew to the greatest monarchy their manner was to grant naturalisation which they called ins civitatis and to grant it in the highest degree that is not only ins conmercci ius connubii ius heredhatis but also ius suffragii and ius honorum and this not to singular persons alone but likewise to whole families yea to cities and sometimes to nations add to this their custom of plantation of colonies whereby the roman plant was removed into the soil of other nations and putting both constitutions together you will say that it was not the roman that spread upon the world but it was the world that spread upon the romans and that was the sure way of greatness i have marvelled sometimes at spain how they clasp and contain so large dominions with so few natural spaniards but sure the whole compass of spain is a very great body of a tree far above rome and sparta at the first and besides though they have not had that usage to naturalise liberally yet they have that which is next to it that is to employ almost indifferently all nations in their militia of ordinary soldiers yea and sometimes in their highest commands nay it seemeth at this instant they are sensible of this want of natives as by the pragmatical sanction now published appeareth 
 
 it is certain that sedentary and arts and delicate manufactures that 
 require rather the finger than the arm have in their nature a contrariety to a 
 military disposition and generally all warlike people are a little idle and love 
 danger better then travail neither must they be too much broken of it if they shall be preserved in vigour 
 therefore it was great advantage in the ancient states of sparta athens rome and others that they had the use of slaves which commonly did rid those manufactures 
 
 but that is abolished in greatest part by the christian law that which cometh 
 nearest to it is to leave those arts chiefly to strangers which for that purpose 
 are the more easily to be received and to contain the principal bulk of the vulgar 
 natives within those three kinds tillers of the ground free servants and 
 of strong and manly arts as smiths masons carpenters etc not 
 reckoning professed soldiers 
 
 but above all for empire and greatness it importeth most that a nation do profess 
 arms as their principal honour study and occupation for the things which we 
 formerly have spoken of are but habitations towards arms and what is habilitation 
 without intention and act romulus after his death as they report or feign sent 
 a present to the romans that above all they should intend arms and then they 
 should prove the greatest empire of the world the fabric of the state of sparta was 
 wholly though not wisely framed and composed to that scope and end the 
 persians and macedonians had it for a flash the gauls germans goths saxons normans and others had it for a time the turks have it at this day though in great declination 
 
 of christian europe they that have it are in effect only the spaniards but it 
 is so plain that every man profiteth in that he most intendeth that it needeth not 
 to be stood upon it is enough to point at it that no nation which doth not directly 
 profess arms may look to have greatness fall into their mouths and on the other 
 side it is a most certain oracle of time that those states that continue long in that profession as the romans and turks principally have done do wonders and those that have professed arms but for an age have notwithstanding commonly attained that greatness in that age which maintained them long after when their profession and exercise of arms hath grown to decay 
 
 incident to this point is for a state to have those laws or customs which may reach forth unto them just occasions as may be pretended of war for there is that justice imprinted in the nature of men that they enter not upon wars whereof so many calamities do ensue but upon some at the least specious grounds and quarrels 
 the turk hath at hand for cause of war the propagation of his law or sect a quarrel that he may always command the romans though they esteemed the extending the limits of their empire to be great honour to their generals when it was done yet they never rested upon that alone to begin a war first therefore let nations that pretend to greatness have this that they be sensible of wrongs either upon borderers merchants or politic ministers and mat they sit not too long upon a provocation 
 secondly let them be pressed and ready to give aids and succours to their 
 confederates as it ever was with the roman in so much as if the confederate had 
 leagues defensive with divers other states and upon invasion offered did implore 
 their aids severally yet the romans would ever be the foremost and leave it to none other to have the honour as for the wars which were anciently made on the behalf of a kind of party or tacit conformity of estate i do not see how they may be well justified as when the romans made a war for the liberty of greece or when the lacedaemonians and athenians made wars to set up or pull down democracies and oligarchies or when wars were made by foreigners under the pretence of justice or protection to deliver the subjects of others from tyranny and oppression and the like let it suffice that no estate expect to be great that is not awake upon any just occasion of arming 
 
 no body can be healthful without exercise neither natural body nor politic and 
 certainly to a kingdom or estate a just and honourable war is the true exercise 
 a civil war indeed is like the heat of a fever but a foreign war is like the heat 
 of exercise and serveth to keep the body in health for in a slothful peace both 
 courages will effeminate and manners corrupt but howsoever it be for happiness 
 without all question for greatness it maketh to be still for the most part in arms 
 and the strength of a veteran army though it be a chargeable business always on 
 foot is that which commonly giveth the law or at least the reputation amongst all 
 neighbour states as may well be seen in spain which hath had in one part or other a veteran army almost continually now by the space of years 
 
 to be master of the sea is an abridgement of a monarchy cicero writing to atticus of pompey his preparation against caesar saith consilium pompeii plane themistocum est putat enim qui mari potitur eum rerum potiri and without doubt pompey had tired out caesar if upon vain confidence he had not left that way we see the great effects of battles by sea the battle of actium decided the empire of the world the battle of lepanto arrested the greatness of the turks 
 there be many examples where have been final to the war 
 but this is when princes or states have set up their rest upon the battles but thus 
 much is certain that he that commands the sea is at great liberty and may take as 
 much and as little of the war as he will whereas those that be strongest by land 
 are many times nevertheless in great straits surely at this day with us of europe 
 the vantage of strength at sea which is one of the principal dowries of this kingdom of great britain is great both because most of the kingdoms of europe are not merely inland but girt with the sea most part of their compass and because the wealth of both indies seems in great part but an accessory to the command of the seas 
 
 the wars of latter ages seem to be made in the dark in respect of the glory and honour which reflected upon men from the wars in ancient time there be now for martial encouragement some degrees and orders of chivalry which nevertheless are conferred promiscuously upon soldiers and no soldiers and some remembrance perhaps upon the scutcheon and some hospitals for maimed soldiers and such like things but in ancient times the trophies erected upon the place of the victory the funeral laudatives and monuments for those that died in the wars the crowns and garlands personal the style of emperor which the great kings of the world after borrowed the triumphs of the generals upon their return the great donatives and largesses upon the disbanding of the armies were things able to inflame all courage but above all that of the triumph amongst the romans was not pageants or gaudery but one of the wisest and noblest institutions that ever was 
 
 for it contained three things honour to the general riches to the treasury out of the spoils and donatives to the army but that honour perhaps were not fit for monarchies except it be in the person of the monarch himself or his sons as it came to pass in the times of the roman emperors who did appropriate the actual triumphs to themselves and their sons for such wars as they did achieve in person and left only for wars achieved by subjects some triumphal garments and ensigns to the general 
 
 to conclude no man can by care taking as the scripture saith add a cubit to his 
 stature in this little model of body but in the great frame of kingdoms and 
 commonwealths it is in the power of princes or estates to add amplitude and 
 greatness to their kingdoms for by introducing such ordinances constitutions and customs as we have now touched they may sow greatness to their posterity and succession but these things are commonly not observed but left to take their chance

 return of the jedi 
 prologue 
 
 the very depth of space there was the length and width and height and thenthese dimensions curved over on themselves into a bending blackness measurableonly by the glinting stars that tumbled through the chasm receding to infinity tothe very depth 
 these stars marked the moments of the universe there were aging orangeembers blue dwarfs twin yellow giants there were collapsing neutron stars andangry supernovae that hissed into the icy emptiness there were borning stars pulsing stars and dying stars there was the death star 
 at the feathered edge of the galaxy the death star floated in stationary orbitabove the green moon moon whose mother planet had long since died ofunknown cataclysm and disappeared into unknown realms the death star was armored battle station nearly twice as big as its predecessor which rebelforces had destroyed so many years twice as big but more than twiceas powerful yet it was only half complete 
 half a steely dark orb it hung above the green world of endor tentacles ofunfinished superstructure curling away toward its living companion like the gropinglegs of a deadly spider 
 an imperial star destroyer approached the giant space station at cruising was city it moved with deliberate grace like some great seadragon it was accompanied by dozens of twin ion engines combat flyers that zipped back and forth around the battle sounding docking regrouping 
 soundlessly the main bay of the ship opened there was a brief an imperial shuttle emerged from the darkness of the hold into the darkness ofspace it sped toward the death star with quiet purpose 
 in the cockpit the shuttle captain and his copilot made final readings monitoreddescent functions it was a sequence each performed a thousand times yetthere was an unusual tension in the air now the captain flipped the transmitterswitch and spoke into his mouthpiece 
 command station this is st code clearance blue starting ourapproach deactivate the security shield 
 static filtered over the receiver then the voice of the port controller thesecurity deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your codetransmission stand by 
 once more silence filled the cockpit the shuttle captain bit the inside of hischeek smiled nervously at his copilot and muttered quick as you can not take long in no mood to wait 
 they refrained from glancing back into the passenger section of the shuttle nowunder for landing the unmistakable sound of the mechanical breathingcoming from the shadow filled the cabin with a terrible impatience 
 in the control room of death star below operators moved along the bank ofpanels monitoring all the space traffic in the area authorizing flight certain areas to certain vehicles the shield operator suddenly checked hismonitor with alarm the depicted the battle station itself the moon a web of deflector from the green the death star only now the security web was beginning to retract and form a clear channel through which the dot that was theimperial shuttle sailed unimpeded toward the massive space station 
 the shield operator quickly called his control officer over to the how to proceed 
 what is it the officer demanded 
 that shuttle has a priority ranking he tried to replace the fear inhis voice with disbelief 
 the officer glanced at the for only a moment before realizing whowas on the shuttle and spoke to himself vader 
 he strode past the view port where the shuttle could be seen already making itsfinal approach and headed toward the docking bay he turned to the controller 
 inform the commander that lord shuttle has arrived 
 the shuttle sat quietly dwarfed by the cavernous reaches of the huge dockingbay hundreds of troops stood assembled in formation flanking the base of theshuttle armored imperial stormtroopers officers and imperial guard they snapped to attention as moff jerjerrod entered 
 thin the death star commander he walkedwithout hurry up the ranks of soldiers to the ramp of the shuttle hurry was not injerjerrod for hurry implied a wanting to be elsewhere and he was a man whodistinctively was exactly where he wanted to be great men never hurried he wasfond of saying great men caused others to hurry 
 yet jerjerrod was not blind to ambition and a visit by such a one as this greatdark lord could not be taken too lightly he stood at the shuttle mouth respect but not hurry 
 suddenly the exit hatch of the shuttle opened pulling the troops in formation toeven tauter attention only darkness glowed from the exit at first then the characteristic electrical respirations like the breathing of a machine andfinally darth vader lord of the sith emerged from the void 
 vader strode down the ramp looking over the assemblage he stopped when hecame to jerjerrod the commander bowed from the neck and smiled 
 lord vader this is an unexpected pleasure we are honored by yourpresence 
 we can dispense with the pleasantries commander words echoed asfrom the bottom of a well the emperor is concerned with your progress i amhere to put you back on schedule 
 jerjerrod turned to pale this was news not expected i assure vader my men are working as fast as they can 
 perhaps i can encourage their progress in ways you have not considered vadergrowled he had ways of course this was known ways and ways again 
 jerjerrod kept his tone even though deep inside the ghost of hurry began toscrabble at his throat that be necessary my lord i tell you withoutquestion this station will be operational as planned 
 afraid the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of thesituation 
 i fear he asks the impossible the commander suggested 
 perhaps you could explain that to him when he arrives face remainedinvisible behind the deathly black mask that protected him but the malice was clear inthe electronically modified voice 
 pallor intensified the emperor is coming here 
 yes commander and he will be quite displeased if you are still behindschedule when he arrives he spoke loudly to spread the threat over all who couldhear 
 we shall double our efforts lord vader and he meant it for even great men hurry in time of great need 
 vader lowered his voice again i hope so commander for your sake theemperor will tolerate no further delay in the final destruction of the outlaw we have secret news included jerjerrod only in this rebel fleet has gathered all its forces into a single giant armada thetime is at hand when we can crush them without mercy in a single blow 
 for the briefest second breathing seemed to quicken then resumed itsmeasured pace like the rising of hollow wind

 in october a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of the kutuzov 
 on october one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief despite the appearance of the locality and surroundings fruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia 
 on the evening of the last march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiers after a march were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning the regiment instead of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before presented a array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the boots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles 
 the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts 
 well michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both felt happy we had our hands full last night however i think the regiment is not a bad one eh 
 the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed 
 it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow 
 what asked the commander 
 at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted two men appeared on horse back they were an followed by a cossack 
 the was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation whatever 
 a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander in chief would be though the did not know these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture 
 a fine mess made of it he remarked 
 there now i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said on the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutely forward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to command sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked the with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to 
 in an time i should say 
 shall we have time to change clothes 
 i know general 
 the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms 
 in half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray instead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance 
 whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of the third company 
 commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to the general third company to the commander the words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer 
 when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of the general to the third company the missing officer appeared from behind his company and though he was a man and not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general the face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouth twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting slackening his pace as he approached 
 you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is this shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh 
 the commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation 
 well why you speak whom have you got there dressed up as a hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe 
 your excellency 
 well your excellency what your excellency but what about your excellency nobody knows 
 your excellency the officer dolokhov who has been reduced to the ranks said the captain softly 
 well has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier if a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others 
 your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march 
 gave him leave leave just like you young men said the regimental commander cooling down a little leave indeed one says a word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i beg you to dress your men decently 
 and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky steps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another because his line was not straight he reached the third company 
 are you standing your leg your leg shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were still five men between him and dolokhov with his uniform 
 dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his clear insolent eyes in the face 
 why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the ras he did not finish 
 general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure dolokhov hurriedly interrupted 
 no talking in the ranks no talking no talking 
 not bound to endure insults dolokhov concluded in loud ringing tones 
 the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent angrily pulling down his tight scarf 
 i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he turned away

 chapter 
 
 the evening after the funeral my young lady and i were seated in the library now musing of us our loss now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future 
 we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the grange at least during life he being allowed to join her there and i to remain as housekeeper that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for and yet i did hope and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment and above all my beloved young mistress when a of the discarded ones not yet hastily in and said that devil heathcliff was coming through the court should he fasten the door in his face 
 if we had been mad enough to order that proceeding we had not time he made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name he was master and availed himself of the privilege to walk straight in without saying a word the sound of our voice directed him to the library he entered and motioning him out shut the door 
 it was the same room into which he had been ushered as a guest eighteen years before the same moon shone through the window and the same autumn landscape lay outside we had not yet lighted a candle but all the apartment was visible even to the portraits on the wall the splendid head of mrs linton and the graceful one of her husband heathcliff advanced to the hearth time had little altered his person either there was the same man his dark face rather sallower and more composed his frame a stone or two heavier perhaps and no other difference catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out when she saw him 
 stop he said arresting her by the arm no more runnings away where would you go come to fetch you home and i hope be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience i was embarrassed how to punish him when i discovered his part in the business such a cobweb a pinch would annihilate him but see by his look that he has received his due i brought him down one evening the day before yesterday and just set him in a chair and never touched him afterwards i sent hareton out and we had the room to ourselves in two hours i called joseph to carry him up again and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost and i fancy he sees me often though i am not near hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together and calls you to protect him from me and whether you like your precious mate or not you must come your concern now i yield all my interest in him to you 
 why not let catherine continue here i pleaded and send master linton to her as you hate them both not miss them they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart 
 seeking a tenant for the grange he answered and i want my children about me to be sure besides that lass owes me her services for her bread not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after linton has gone make haste and get ready now and oblige me to compel you 
 i shall said catherine linton is all i have to love in the world and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me and me to him you cannot make us hate each other and i defy you to hurt him when i am by and i defy you to frighten me 
 you are a boastful champion replied heathcliff but i like you well enough to hurt him you shall get the full benefit of the torment as long as it lasts it is not i who will make him hateful to is his own sweet spirit as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences expect thanks for this noble devotion i heard him draw a pleasant picture to zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as i the inclination is there and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength 
 i know he has a bad nature said catherine your son but glad a better to forgive it and i know he loves me and for that reason i love him mr heathcliff you have nobody to love you and however miserable you make us we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery you are miserable are you not lonely like the devil and envious like him nobody loves will cry for you when you die i be you 
 catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies 
 you shall be sorry to be yourself presently said her if you stand there another minute begone witch and get your things 
 she scornfully withdrew in her absence i began to beg for place at the heights offering to resign mine to her but he would suffer it on no account he bid me be silent and then for the first time allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures having studied mrs linton he said 
 i shall have that home not because i need it but he turned abruptly to the fire and continued with what for lack of a better word i must call a tell you what i did yesterday i got the sexton who was digging grave to remove the earth off her and i opened it i thought once i would have stayed there when i saw her face hers had hard work to stir me but he said it would change if the air blew on it and so i struck one side of the coffin loose and covered it up not side damn him i wish been soldered in lead and i bribed the sexton to pull it away when laid there and slide mine out too have it made so and then by the time linton gets to us not know which is which 
 you were very wicked mr heathcliff i exclaimed were you not ashamed to disturb the dead 
 i disturbed nobody nelly he replied and i gave some ease to myself i shall be a great deal more comfortable now and have a better chance of keeping me underground when i get there disturbed her no she has disturbed me night and day through eighteen yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil i dreamt i was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers 
 and if she had been dissolved into earth or worse what would you have dreamt of then i said 
 of dissolving with her and being more happy still he answered do you suppose i dread any change of that sort i expected such a transformation on raising the lid but better pleased that it should not commence till i share it besides unless i had received a distinct impression of her passionless features that strange feeling would hardly have been removed it began oddly you know i was wild after she died and eternally from dawn to dawn praying her to return to me her spirit i have a strong faith in ghosts i have a conviction that they can and do exist among us the day she was buried there came a fall of snow in the evening i went to the churchyard it blew bleak as round was solitary i fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the den so late and no one else had business to bring them there being alone and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us i said to have her in my arms again if she be cold think it is this north wind that chills me and if she be motionless it is sleep i got a spade from the toolhouse and began to delve with all my scraped the coffin i fell to work with my hands the wood commenced cracking about the screws i was on the point of attaining my object when it seemed that i heard a sigh from someone above close at the edge of the grave and bending down if i can only get this off i muttered i wish they may shovel in the earth over us both and i wrenched at it more desperately still there was another sigh close at my ear i appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the wind i knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by but as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark though it cannot be discerned so certainly i felt that cathy was there not under me but on the earth a sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb i relinquished my labour of agony and turned consoled at once unspeakably consoled her presence was with me it remained while i refilled the grave and led me home you may laugh if you will but i was sure i should see her there i was sure she was with me and i could not help talking to her having reached the heights i rushed eagerly to the door it was fastened and i remember that accursed earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance i remember stopping to kick the breath out of him and then hurrying upstairs to my room and hers i looked round felt her by could almost see her and yet i could not i ought to have sweat blood then from the anguish of my the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse i had not one she showed herself as she often was in life a devil to me and since then sometimes more and sometimes less been the sport of that intolerable torture infernal keeping my nerves at such a stretch that if they had not resembled catgut they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of when i sat in the house with hareton it seemed that on going out i should meet her when i walked on the moors i should meet her coming in when i went from home i hastened to return she must be somewhere at the heights i was certain and when i slept in her was beaten out of that i lie there for the moment i closed my eyes she was either outside the window or sliding back the panels or entering the room or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child and i must open my lids to see and so i opened and closed them a hundred times a be always disappointed it racked me often groaned aloud till that old rascal joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me now since seen her little it s a strange way of killing not by inches but by fractions and hairbreadths to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years 
 mr heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead his hair clung to it wet with perspiration his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire the brows not contracted but raised next the temples diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance but imparting a peculiar look of trouble and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject he only half addressed me and i maintained silence i like to hear him talk after a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage and while so occupied catherine entered announcing that she was ready when her pony should be saddled 
 send that over tomorrow said heathcliff to me then turning to her he may do without your pony it is a fine evening and need no ponies at wuthering heights for what journeys you take your own feet will serve you come along 
 goodbye ellen whispered my dear little mistress as she kissed me her lips felt like ice come and see me ellen forget 
 take care you do no such thing mrs dean said her new father when i wish to speak to you come here i want none of your prying at my house 
 he signed her to precede him and casting back a look that cut my heart she obeyed i watched them from the window walk down the garden heathcliff fixed arm under his though she disputed the act at first evidently and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley whose trees concealed them

 come jo time 
 for what 
 you mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today 
 done a good many rash and foolish things in my life but i think i ever was mad enough to say make six calls in one day when a single one upsets me for a week 
 yes you did it was a bargain between us i was to finish the crayon of beth for you and you were to go properly with me and return our neighbors visits 
 if it was fair that was in the bond and i stand to the letter of my bond shylock there is a pile of clouds in the east not fair and i go 
 now shirking a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months 
 at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelled thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready 
 jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement 
 why not neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i wish to see them you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please it pays for you to be fine it for me and furbelows only worry me 
 oh dear sighed amy now in a contrary fit and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready sure no pleasure to me to go today but a debt we owe society and no one to pay it but you and me do anything for you jo if only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil you can talk so well look so aristocratic in your best things and behave so beautifully if you try that proud of you afraid to go alone do come and take care of me 
 an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way the idea of my being aristocratic and and your being afraid to go anywhere alone i know which is the most absurd well go if i must and do my best you shall be commander of the expedition and obey blindly will that satisfy you said jo with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission 
 a perfect cherub now put on all your best things and tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression i want people to like you and they would if only try to be a little more agreeable do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief stop at and borrow her white sunshade and then you can have my one 
 while amy dressed she issued her orders and jo obeyed them not without entering her protest however for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel as the last touch of elegance she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance saying meekly 
 perfectly miserable but if you consider me presentable i die happy 
 highly satisfactory turn slowly round and let me get a careful view jo revolved and amy gave a touch here and there then fell back with her head on one side observing graciously yes do your head is all i could ask for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing hold back your shoulders and carry your hands easily no matter if your gloves do pinch one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawl i but very nice to see you and so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one simple but handsome and those folds over the arm are really artistic is the point of my mantle in the middle and have i looped my dress evenly i like to show my boots for my feet are pretty though my nose 
 you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever said jo looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair am i to drag my best dress through the dust or loop it up please 
 hold it yup when you walk but drop it in the house the sweeping style suits you best and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully you half buttoned one cuff do it at once never look finished if you are not careful about the little details for they make yup the pleasing whole 
 jo sighed and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove in doing up her cuff but at last both were ready and sailed away looking as pretty as picters hannah said as she hung out of the upper window to watch them 
 now jo dear the chesters consider themselves very elegant people so i want you to put on your best deportment make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you just be calm cool and quiet safe and ladylike and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes said amy as they approached the first place having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by meg with a baby on each arm 
 let me see calm cool and quiet yes i think i can promise that played the part of a prim young lady on the stage and try it off my powers are great as you shall see so be easy in your mind my child 
 amy looked relieved but naughty jo took her at her word for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed every fold correctly draped calm as a summer sea cool as a snowbank and as silent as the sphinx in vain mrs chester alluded to her charming novel and the misses chester introduced parties picnics the opera and the fashions each and all were answered by a smile a bow and a demure yes or no with the chill on in vain amy telegraphed the word talk tried to draw her out and administered covert pokes with her foot jo sat as if blandly unconcious of it all with deportment like face icily regular splendidly null 
 what a haughty uninteresting creature that oldest miss march is was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies as the door closed upon their guests jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall but amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions and very naturally laid the blame upon jo 
 how could you mistake me so i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone try to be sociable at the gossip as other girls do and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up they move in the best society are valuable persons for us to know and i fail to make a good impression there for anything 
 be agreeable gossip and giggle and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like i rather enjoy this and now imitate what is called a charming girl i can do it for i have may chester as a model and improve upon her see if the lambs say what a lively nice creature that jo march is 
 amy felt anxious as well she might for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room kiss all the young ladies with effusion beam graciously upon the young gentlemen and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder amy was taken possession of by mrs lamb with whom she was a favorite and forced to hear a long account of last attack while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her so situated she was powerless to check jo who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief and talked away as volubly as the lady a knot of heads gathered about her and amy strained her ears to hear what was going on for broken sentences filled her with curiosity and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun one may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation 
 she rides splendidly who taught her 
 no one she used to practice mounting holding the reins and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree now she rides anything for she know what fear is and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well she has such a passion for it i often tell her if everything else fails she can be a horsebreaker and get her living so 
 at this awful speech amy contained herself with difficulty for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady which was her especial aversion but what could she do for the old lady was in the middle of her story and long before it was done jo was off again make more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders 
 yes amy was in despair that day for all the good beasts were gone and of three left one was lame one blind and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start nice animal for a pleasure party it 
 which did she choose asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject 
 none of them she heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river and though a lady had never ridden him she resolved to try because he was handsome and spirited her struggles were really pathetic there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse my dear creature she actually rowed it over the river put it on her head and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man 
 did she ride the horse 
 of course she did and had a capital time i expected to see her brought home in fragments but she managed him perfectly and was the life of the party 
 well i call that plucky and young mr lamb turned an approving glance upon amy wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable 
 she was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago must needs answer with unnecessary frankness oh amy painted it you buy those soft shades so we paint ours any color we like a great comfort to have an artistic sister 
 that an original idea cried miss lamb who found jo great fun 
 nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances nothing the child do why she wanted a pair of blue boots for party so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw and they looked exactly like satin added jo with an air of pride in her accomplishments that exasperated amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her 
 we read a story of yours the other day and enjoyed it very much observed the elder miss lamb wishing to compliment the literary lady who did not look the character just then it must be confessed 
 any mention of her works always had a bad effect upon jo who either grew rigid and looked offended or changed the subject with a brusque remark as now sorry you could find nothing better to read i write that rubbish because it sells and ordinary people like it are you going to new york this winter 
 as miss lamb had enjoyed the story this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary the minute it was made jo saw her mistake but fearing to make the matter worse suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half finished sentences in their mouths 
 amy we must go dear do come and see us we are pining for a visit i dare to ask you mr lamb but if you should come i think i shall have the heart to send you away 
 jo said this with such a droll imitation of may gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time 
 i do well asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away 
 nothing could have been worse was crushing reply what possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle and the hats and boots and all the rest of it 
 why funny and amuses people they know we are poor so no use pretending that we have grooms buy three or four hats a season and have things as easy and fine as they do 
 you go and tell them all our little shifts and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way you a bit of proper pride and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak said amy despairingly 
 poor jo looked abashed and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors 
 how shall i behave here she asked as they approached the third mansion 
 just as you please i wash my hands of you was short answer 
 then enjoy myself the boys are at home and have a comfortable time goodness knows i need a little change for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution returned jo gruffly being disturbed by her failure to suit 
 an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr tudor who happened to be calling likewise jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing she listened to college stories with deep interest caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur agreed heartily that tom brown was a brick regardless of the improper form of praise and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to smile upon her as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs bearlike but affectionate and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired frenchwoman 
 leaving her sister to her own devices amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her content mr uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord and amy regarded the whole family with great respect for in spite of her american birth and breeding she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal laddie some years ago and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old like that of a big son for an imperious little mother who held him while she could and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time and when the proper number of minutes had passed she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society and looked about for jo fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march 
 it might have been worse but amy considered it bad for jo sat on the grass with an encampment of boys about her and a dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress as she related one of pranks to her admiring audience one small child was poking turtles with cherished parasol a second was eating gingerbread over best bonnet and a third playing ball with her gloves but all were enjoying themselves and when jo collected her damaged property to go her escort accompanied her begging her to come again it was such fun to hear about larks 
 capital boys they i feel quite young and brisk again after that said jo strolling along with her hands behind her partly from habit partly to conceal the bespattered parasol 
 why do you always avoid mr tudor asked amy wisely refraining from any comment upon dilapidated appearance 
 like him he puts on airs snubs his sisters worries his father a nd speak respectfully of his mother laurie says he is fast and i consider him a desirable acquaintance so i let him alone 
 you might treat him civilly at least you gave him a cool nod and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to tommy chamberlain whose father keeps a grocery store if you had just reversed the nod and the bow it would have been right said amy reprovingly 
 no it returned jo i neither like respect nor admire tudor though his niece was a third cousin to a lord tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever i think well of him and like to show that i do for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels 
 no use trying to argue with you began amy 
 not the least my dear interrupted jo so let us look amiable and drop a card here as the kings are evidently out for which deeply grateful 
 the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house and being told that the young ladies were engaged 
 now let us go home and never mind aunt march today we can run down there any time and really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers when we are tired and cross 
 speak for yourself if you please aunt march likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style and making a formal call a little thing to do but it gives her pleasure and i believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them stoop down and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet 
 what a good girl you are amy said jo with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister which was fresh and spotless still i wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you i think of them but it takes too much time to do them so i wait for a chance to confer a great favor and let the small ones slip but they tell best in the end i fancy 
 amy smiled and was mollified at once saying with a maternal air women should learn to be agreeable particularly poor ones for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive if remember that and practice it be better liked than i am because there is more of you 
 a crotchety old thing and always shall be but willing to own that you are right only easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i feel like it a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes it 
 a greater not to be able to hide them i mind saying that i approve of tudor any more than you do but not called upon to tell him so neither are you and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is 
 but i think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men and how can they do it except by their manners preaching does not do any good as i know to my sorrow since had teddie to manage but there are many little ways in which i can influence him without a word and i say we ought to do it to others if we can 
 teddy is a remarkable boy and be taken as a sample of other boys said amy in a tone of solemn conviction which would have convulsed the remarkable boy if he had heard it if we were belles or women of wealth and position we might do something perhaps but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we approve of them and smile upon another set because we do have a particle of effect and we should only be considered odd and puritanical 
 so we are to countenance things and people which we detest merely because we are not belles and millionaires are we a nice sort of morality 
 i argue about it i only know that the way of the world and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains i like reformers and i hope you never try to be one 
 i do like them and i shall be one if i can for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them we agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new you will get on the best but i shall have the liveliest time of it i should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting i think 
 well compose yourself now and worry aunt with your new ideas 
 try not to but always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her my doom and i help it 
 they found aunt carrol with the old lady both absorbed in some very interesting subject but they dropped it as the girls came in with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces jo was not in a good humor and the perverse fit returned but amy who had virtuously done her duty kept her temper and pleased everybody was in a most angelic frame of mind this amiable spirit was felt at once and both aunts my deared her affectionately looking what they afterward said emphatically that child improves every day 
 are you going to help about the fair dear asked mrs carrol as amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young 
 yes aunt mrs chester asked me if i would and i offered to tend a table as i have nothing but my time to give 
 not put in jo decidedly i hate to be patronized and the chesters think a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair i wonder you consented amy they only want you to work 
 i am willing to work for the freedmen as well as the chesters and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant 
 quite right and proper i like your grateful spirit my dear a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts some do not and that is trying observed aunt march looking over her spectacles at jo who sat apart rocking herself with a somewhat morose expression 
 if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them she would have turned in a minute but unfortunately we have windows in our breasts and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper by her next speech jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue 
 i like favors they oppress and make me feel like a slave rather do everything for myself and be perfectly independent 
 ahem coughed aunt carrol softly with a look at aunt march 
 i told you so said aunt march with a decided nod to aunt carrol 
 mercifully unconscious of what she had done jo sat with her nose in the air and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting 
 do you speak french dear asked mrs carrol laying a hand on 
 pretty well thanks to aunt march who lets esther talk to me as often as i like replied amy with a grateful look which caused the old lady to smile affably 
 how are you about languages asked mrs carrol of jo 
 know a word very stupid about studying anything bear french such a slippery silly sort of language was the brusque reply 
 another look passed between the ladies and aunt march said to amy you are quite strong and well no dear i believe eyes trouble you any more do they 
 not at all thank you very well and mean to do great things next winter so that i may be ready for rome whenever that joyful time arrives 
 good girl you deserve to go and sure you will some day said aunt march with an approving pat on the head as amy picked up her ball for her 
 crosspatch draw the latch sit by the fire and spin 
 squalled polly bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into face with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing 
 most observing bird said the old lady 
 come and take a walk my dear cried polly hopping toward the china closet with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar 
 thank you i will come amy and jo brought the visit to an end feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution she shook hands in a gentlemanly manner but amy kissed both the aunts and the girls departed leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine which impression caused aunt march to say as they vanished 
 better do it mary supply the money and aunt carrol to reply decidedly i certainly will if her father and mother consent

lionfish nov chapter the dreamcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 it comes down to this said hermione rubbing her forehead either mr crouch attacked viktor or somebody else attacked both of them when viktor looking 
 
 it been crouch said ron at once why he was gone when harry and dumbledore got there done a runner 
 
 i think so said harry shaking his head he seemed really weak i reckon he was up to disapparating or anything 
 
 you disapparate on the hogwarts grounds i told you enough times said hermione 
 
 okayhows this for a theory said ron excitedly krum attacked crouch no wait for it and then stunned himself 
 
 and mr crouch evaporated did he said hermione coldly 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 it was daybreak harry ron and hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the owlery together to send a note to sirius now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds all three of them were and pale because they had been talking late into the night about mr crouch 
 
 just go through it again harry said hermione what did mr crouch actually say 
 
 told you he making much sense said harry he said he wanted to warn dumbledore about something he definitely mentioned bertha jorkins and he seemed to think she was dead he kept saying stuff was his mentioned his son 
 
 well that was his fault said hermione testily 
 
 he was out of his mind said harry half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive and he kept talking to percy about work and giving him instructions 
 
 andremind me what he said about said ron tentatively 
 
 told you harry repeated dully he said getting stronger 
 
 there was a pause then ron said in a falsely confident voice but he was out of his mind like you said so half of it was probably just raving 
 
 he was sanest when he was trying to talk about voldemort said harry and ron winced at the sound of the name he was having real trouble stringing two words together but that was when he seemed to know where he was and know what he wanted to do he just kept saying he had to see dumbledore 
 
 harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters the many perches were every now and then another owl would swoop in through one of the windows returning from its hunting with a mouse in its beak 
 
 if snape held me up harry said bitterly we got there in time the headmaster is busy this rubbish potter why he have just got out of the way 
 
 maybe he want you to get there said ron quickly maybe hang on how fast reckon he gotten down to the forest reckon he beaten you and dumbledore there 
 
 not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something said harry 
 
 put it past him ron muttered 
 
 we need to see professor moody said hermione we need to find out whether he found mr crouch 
 
 if he had the map on him it been easy said harry 
 
 unless crouch was already outside the grounds said ron because it only shows up to the boundaries 
 
 shh said hermione suddenly 
 
 somebody was climbing the steps up to the owlery harry could hear two voices arguing coming closer and closer 
 
 blackmail that is we could get into a lot of trouble for that 
 
 tried being polite time to play dirty like him he like the ministry of magic knowing what he did 
 
 telling you if you put that in writing blackmail 
 
 yeah and you be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff will you 
 
 the owlery door banged open fred and george came over the threshold then froze at the sight of harry ron and hermione 
 
 you doing here ron and fred said at the same time 
 
 sending a letter said harry and george in unison 
 
 what at this time said hermione and fred 
 
 fred grinned 
 
 fine we ask you what doing if you ask us he said 
 
 he was holding a sealed envelope in his hands harry glanced at it but fred whether accidentally or on purpose shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered 
 
 well let us hold you up fred said making a mock bow and pointing at the door 
 
 ron move you blackmailing he said 
 
 the grin vanished from face harry saw george half glance at fred before smiling at ron 
 
 be stupid i was only joking he said easily 
 
 sound like that said ron 
 
 fred and george looked at each other then fred said abruptly told you before ron keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is see why you would but 
 
 my business if blackmailing someone said ron right you could end up in serious trouble for that 
 
 told you i was joking said george he walked over to fred pulled the letter out of his hands and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother you are ron carry on like this and be made a prefect 
 
 no i said ron hotly 
 
 george carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off george turned around and grinned at ron 
 
 well stop telling people what to do then see you later 
 
 he and fred left the owlery harry ron and hermione stared at one another 
 
 you think they know something about all this do you hermione whispered about crouch and everything 
 
 no said harry if it was something that serious tell someone tell dumbledore 
 
 ron however was looking uncomfortable 
 
 the matter hermione asked him 
 
 well said ron slowly i dunno if they would obsessed with making money lately i noticed it when i was hanging around with them when you know 
 
 we talking harry finished the sentence for him yeah but blackmail 
 
 this joke shop idea got said ron i thought they were only saying it to annoy mum but they really mean it they want to start one only got a year left at hogwarts they keep going on about how time to think about their future and dad help them and they need gold to get started 
 
 hermione was looking uncomfortable now 
 
 yes butthey do anything against the law to get gold 
 
 they said ron looking skeptical i dunnothey exactly mind breaking rules do they 
 
 yes but this is the law said hermione looking scared this some silly school get a lot more than detention for blackmail ronmaybe better tell percy 
 
 are you mad said ron tell percy probably do a crouch and turn them in he stared at the window through which fred and owl had departed then said come on get some breakfast 
 
 think too early to go and see professor moody hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase 
 
 yes said harry probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn think trying to attack him while asleep give it till break 
 
 history of magic had rarely gone so slowly harry kept checking watch having finally discarded his own but was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too all three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept even hermione taking her usual notes but was sitting with her head on her hand gazing at professor binns with her eyes out of focus 
 
 when the bell finally rang they hurried out into the corridors toward the dark arts classroom and found professor moody leaving it he looked as tired as they felt the eyelid of his normal eye was drooping giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual 
 
 professor moody harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd 
 
 hello potter growled moody his magical eye followed a couple of passing first years who sped up looking nervous it rolled into the back of head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again 
 
 come in here 
 
 he stood back to let them into his empty classroom limped in after them and closed the door 
 
 did you find him harry asked without preamble mr crouch 
 
 no said moody he moved over to his desk sat down stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan and pulled out his hip flask 
 
 did you use the map harry said 
 
 of course said moody taking a swig from his flask took a leaf out of your book potter summoned it from my office into the forest he anywhere on there 
 
 so he did disapparate said ron 
 
 you disapparate on the grounds ron said hermione there are other ways he could have disappeared there professor 
 
 magical eye quivered as it rested on hermione another one who might think about a career as an auror he told her mind works the right way granger 
 
 hermione flushed pink with pleasure 
 
 well he invisible said harry the map shows invisible people he left the grounds then 
 
 but under his own steam said hermione eagerly or because someone made him 
 
 yeah someone pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him they said ron quickly looking hopefully at moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an auror 
 
 we rule out kidnap growled moody 
 
 so said ron reckon somewhere in hogsmeade 
 
 could be anywhere said moody shaking his head only thing we know for sure is that not here 
 
 he yawned widely so that his scars stretched and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth then he said now told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators but nothing you can do for crouch the be looking for him now notified them potter you just keep your mind on the third task 
 
 what said harry oh yeah 
 
 he given the maze a single thought since left it with krum the previous night 
 
 should be right up your street this one said moody looking up at harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin from what said managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the sorcerers stone in your first year you 
 
 we helped ron said quickly me and hermione helped 
 
 moody grinned 
 
 well help him practice for this one and be very surprised if he win said moody in the meantimeconstant vigilance potter constant vigilance he took another long draw from his hip flask and his magical eye swiveled onto the window the topmost sail of the durmstrang ship was visible through it 
 
 you two counseled moody his normal eye on ron and hermione you stick close to potter all right keeping an eye on things but all the sameyou can never have too many eyes out 
 
 
 
 sirius sent their owl back the very next morning it fluttered down beside harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of hermione clutching a copy of the daily prophet in its beak she took the newspaper scanned the first few pages said ha she got wind of crouch then joined ron and harry in reading what sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last 
 
 harry 
 what do you think you are playing at walking off into the forest with viktor krum i want you to swear by return owl that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night there is somebody highly dangerous at hogwarts it is clear to me that they wanted to stop crouch from seeing dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark you could have been killed 
 your name get into the goblet of fire by accident if trying to attack you on their last chance stay close to ron and hermione do not leave gryffindor tower after hours and arm yourself for the third task practice stunning and disarming a few hexes go amiss either nothing you can do about crouch keep your head down and look after yourself waiting for your letter giving me your word you stray again 
 sirius 
 he to lecture me about being said harry in mild indignation as he folded up letter and put it inside his robes after all the stuff he did at school 
 
 worried about you said hermione sharply just like moody and hagrid so listen to them 
 
 no tried to attack me all year said harry no done anything to me at all 
 
 except put your name in the goblet of fire said hermione and they done that for a reason harry snuffles is right maybe been biding their time maybe this is the task going to get you 
 
 look said harry impatiently say sirius is right and someone stunned krum to kidnap crouch well they been in the trees near us they but they waited till i was out of the way until they acted they so it look like their target does it 
 
 they have made it look like an accident if murdered you in the forest said hermione but if you die during a task 
 
 they care about attacking krum did they said harry why they just polish me off at the same time they made it look like krum and i had a duel or something 
 
 harry i understand it either said hermione desperately i just know there are a lot of odd things going on and i like right sirius is right got to get in training for the third task straight away and you make sure you write back to sirius and promise him not going to go sneaking off alone again 
 
 
 
 the hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when harry had to stay indoors for the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with hermione and ron looking up hexes or else in empty classrooms which they sneaked into to practice harry was concentrating on the stunning spell which he had never used before the trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on and part 
 
 we kidnap mrs norris ron suggested on monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their charms classroom having just been stunned and reawoken by harry for the fifth time in a row stun her for a bit or you could use dobby harry i bet do anything to help you not complaining or anything he got gingerly to his feet rubbing his backside but aching all over 
 
 well you keep missing the cushions you said hermione impatiently rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the banishing spell which flitwick had left in a cabinet just try and fall backward 
 
 once stunned you aim too well hermione said ron angrily why you take a turn 
 
 well i think got it now anyway said hermione hastily and we have to worry about disarming because been able to do that for think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening 
 
 she looked down the list they had made in the library 
 
 i like the look of this one she said this impediment curse should slow down anything trying to attack you harry start with that one 
 
 the bell rang they hastily shoved the cushions back into cupboard and slipped out of the classroom 
 
 see you at dinner said hermione and she set off for arithmancy while harry and ron headed toward north tower and divination broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows the sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled 
 
 going to be boiling in room she never puts out that fire said ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor 
 
 he was quite right the dimly lit room was swelteringly hot the fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows while professor trelawney was looking the other way disentangling her shawl from a lamp he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair so that a soft breeze played across his face it was extremely comfortable 
 
 my dears said professor trelawney sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes we have almost finished our work on planetary divination today however will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of mars for he is placed most interestingly at the present time if you will all look this way i will dim the lights 
 
 she waved her wand and the lamps went out the fire was the only source of light now professor trelawney bent down and lifted from under her chair a miniature model of the solar system contained within a glass dome it was a beautiful thing each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle mars was making to neptune the heavily perfumed fumes washed over him and the breeze from the window played across his face he could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain his eyelids began to droop 
 
 he was riding on the back of an eagle owl soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old house set high on a hillside lower and lower they flew the wind blowing pleasantly in face until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered now they were flying along a gloomy passageway to a room at the very endthrough the door they went into a dark room whose windows were boarded up 
 
 harry had left the backhe was watching now as it fluttered across the room into a chair with its back to were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chairboth of them were stirring 
 
 one was a huge snakethe other was a mana short balding man a man with watery eyes and a pointed nosehe was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug 
 
 you are in luck wormtail said a cold voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed you are very fortunate indeed your blunder has not ruined everything he is dead 
 
 my lord gasped the man on the floor my lord i ami am so pleasedand so sorry 
 
 nagini said the cold voice you are out of luck i will not be feeding wormtail to you after allbut never mind never mindthere is still harry potter 
 
 the snake hissed harry could see its tongue fluttering 
 
 now wormtail said the cold voice perhaps one more little reminder why i will not tolerate another blunder from you 
 
 my lordnoi beg you 
 
 the tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair it was pointing at wormtail 
 
 crucio said the cold voice 
 
 wormtail screamed screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire the screaming filled ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain he was yelling toovoldemort would hear him would know he was there 
 
 harry harry 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying on the floor of professor room with his hands over his face his scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering the pain had been real the whole class was standing around him and ron was kneeling next to him looking terrified 
 
 you all right he said 
 
 of course he said professor trelawney looking thoroughly excited her great eyes loomed over harry gazing at him what was it potter a premonition an apparition what did you see 
 
 nothing harry lied he sat up he could feel himself shaking he stop himself from looking around into the shadows behind him voice had sounded so close 
 
 you were clutching your scar said professor trelawney you were rolling on the floor clutching your scar come now potter i have experience in these matters 
 
 harry looked up at her 
 
 i need to go to the hospital wing i think he said bad headache 
 
 my dear you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room said professor trelawney if you leave now you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever 
 
 i want to see anything except a headache cure said harry 
 
 he stood up the class backed away they all looked unnerved 
 
 see you later harry muttered to ron and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor ignoring professor trelawney who was wearing an expression of great frustration as though she had just been denied a real treat 
 
 when harry reached the bottom of her stepladder however he did not set off for the hospital wing he had no intention whatsoever of going there sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again and harry was going to follow his advice he was going straight to office he marched down the corridors thinking about what he had seen in the dreamit had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on privet ran over the details in his mind trying to make sure he could remember had heard voldemort accusing wormtail of making a blunderbut the owl had brought good news the blunder had been repaired somebody was deadso wormtail was not going to be fed to the snakehe harry was going to be fed to it instead 
 
 harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office without noticing he blinked looked around realized what he had done and retraced his steps stopping in front of it then he remembered that he know the password 
 
 sherbet lemon he tried tentatively 
 
 the gargoyle did not move 
 
 okay said harry staring at it pear drop er licorice wand fizzing whizbee best blowing gum bertie every flavor beansoh no he like them does just open you he said angrily i really need to see him its urgent 
 
 the gargoyle remained immovable 
 
 harry kicked it achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe 
 
 chocolate frog he yelled angrily standing on one leg sugar quill cockroach cluster 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside harry blinked 
 
 cockroach cluster he said amazed i was only joking 
 
 he hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker 
 
 he could hear voices from inside the office he stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated listening 
 
 dumbledore afraid i see the connection see it at all it was the voice of the minister of magic cornelius fudge ludo says berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost i agree we would have expected to have found her by now but all the same no evidence of foul play dumbledore none at all as for her disappearance being linked with barty 
 
 and what do you thinks happened to barty crouch minister said growling voice 
 
 i see two possibilities alastor said fudge either crouch has finally cracked more than likely sure agree given his personal history lost his mind and gone wandering off somewhere 
 
 he wandered extremely quickly if that is the case cornelius said dumbledore calmly 
 
 or else well fudge sounded embarrassed well reserve judgment until after seen the place where he was found but you say it was just past the beauxbatons carriage dumbledore you know what that woman is 
 
 i consider her to be a very able headmistress and an excellent dancer said dumbledore quietly 
 
 dumbledore come said fudge angrily you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of hagrid they all turn out harmless if indeed you can call hagrid harmless with that monster fixation got 
 
 i no more suspect madame maxime than hagrid said dumbledore just as calmly i think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced cornelius 
 
 can we wrap up this discussion growled moody 
 
 yes yes go down to the grounds then said fudge impatiently 
 
 no not that said moody just that potter wants a word with you dumbledore just outside the door 
 
 rowling
