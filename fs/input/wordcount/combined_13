 chapter vii 
 
 toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they were so far from home that he accepted offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna 
 and if you put up at my house that will be better still it come on said uncle you see damp weather and you could rest and the little countess could be driven home in a trap 
 offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a trap while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to house 
 some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving the presence of natasha a woman a lady and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her 
 arinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt dangles see got a little hunting horn 
 goodness gracious see her knife 
 she a tartar 
 how is it you go head over heels asked the boldest of all addressing natasha directly 
 uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors 
 the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natasha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the house with its bare unplastered log walls was not overclean it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but neither was it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples and wolf and fox skins hung about 
 uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvorov of the father and mother and of himself in military uniform the study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room rugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen from behind this came laughter and whispers natasha nicholas and petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa petya leaning on his elbow fell asleep at once natasha and nicholas were silent their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at one another now that the hunt was over and they were in the house nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister natasha gave him a wink and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it 
 after a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers and small top boots and natasha felt that this costume the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the right thing and not at all worse than a or frock coat uncle too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the and laughter it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merriment 
 right young countess it come on i never saw anyone like her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that had been cut short ridden all day like a man and is as fresh as ever 
 soon after reappearance the door was opened evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy woman of about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a large loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional stoutness which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head this woman who was housekeeper trod very lightly she went to the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors and dishes and arranged them on the table when she had finished she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her face here i am i am she now do you understand uncle her expression said to rostov how could one help understanding not only nicholas but even natasha understood the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when anisya fedorovna entered on the tray was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and sparkling mead apples nuts raw and roasted and sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves made with honey and preserves made with sugar 
 all this was the fruit of anisya housekeeping gathered and prepared by her the smell and taste of it all had a smack of anisya fedorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and pleasant smiles 
 take this little she kept saying as she offered natasha first one thing and then another 
 natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such sweets or such a chicken anywhere anisya fedorovna left the room 
 after supper over their cherry brandy rostov and uncle talked of past and future hunts of rugay and dogs while natasha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried several times to wake petya that he might eat something but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up natasha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon after a casual pause such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in own house uncle answering a thought that was in his visitors mind said 
 this you see is how i am finishing my days death will come it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone 
 face was very significant and even handsome as he said this involuntarily rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province uncle had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks they called him in to decide family disputes chose him as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice and to other posts but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in winter and lying in his overgrown garden in summer 
 why you enter the service uncle 
 i did once but gave it up i am not fit for it it come on i make head or tail of it for you i brains enough now hunting is another matter it come on open the door there he shouted why have you shut it 
 the door at the end of the passage led to the room as they called the room for the hunt servants 
 there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the door into the room from which came the clear sounds of a balalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was playing natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better 
 mitka my coachman i have got him a good balalayka fond of it said uncle 
 it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the room when uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of such music 
 how good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much 
 very good said natasha reproachfully noticing her tone not very good simply delicious 
 just as pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemed to her the acme of musical delight 
 more please more cried natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka ceased mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of my lady with trills and variations uncle sat listening slightly smiling with his head on one side the air was repeated a hundred times the balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again anisya fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost 
 you like listening she said to natasha with a smile extremely like a good player of ours she added 
 he play that part right said uncle suddenly with an energetic gesture here he ought to burst out it come on ought to burst out 
 do you play then asked natasha 
 uncle did not answer but smiled 
 anisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i touched it for a long time it come on given it up 
 anisya fedorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar 
 without looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping the case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at anisya fedorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not my lady but the song came a maiden down the street the tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the hearts of nicholas and natasha arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from anisya whole being anisya fedorovna flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energetic firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where anisya fedorovna had just stood something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there as he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap 
 lovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted natasha as soon as he had finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas nicholas she said turning to her brother as if asking him what is it moves me so 
 nicholas too was greatly pleased by playing and uncle played the piece over again anisya smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces 
 fetching water clear and sweet 
 stop dear maiden i entreat played uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders 
 go on uncle dear natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended on it 
 uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance 
 now then niece he exclaimed waving to natasha the hand that had just struck a chord 
 natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude 
 where how and when had this young countess educated by an emigree french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale would one would have supposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had expected of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantly proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end and they were already admiring her 
 the french shawl dance 
 she did the right thing with such precision such complete precision that anisya fedorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was in anisya and in father and mother and aunt and in every russian man and woman 
 well little countess it come on cried uncle with a joyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you it come on 
 chosen already said nicholas smiling 
 oh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at natasha who nodded her head with a happy smile 
 and such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile mean when he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is as if he thought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety but he would understand it all where is he now she thought and her face suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dare to think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly beside uncle begging him to play something more 
 uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song 
 as twas growing dark last night 
 fell the snow so soft and light 
 uncle sang as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natasha was in ecstasies over singing she resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song 
 after nine two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to look for them arrived to fetch natasha and petya the count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of the men 
 petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps natasha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness he accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns 
 dear niece his voice called out of the darkness not the voice natasha had known previously but the one that had sung as twas growing dark last night 
 in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke 
 what a darling uncle is said natasha when they had come out onto the highroad 
 yes returned nicholas not cold 
 no quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answered natasha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long while the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud 
 what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all find place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last night the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught 
 got it said nicholas 
 what were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natasha 
 they were fond of asking one another that question 
 i said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i thought that rugay the red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man he would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for his manner what a good fellow uncle is you think so well and you 
 i wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and then i thought no nothing else 
 i know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as natasha knew by the sound of his voice 
 no said natasha though she had in reality been thinking about prince andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have liked uncle and then i was saying to myself all the way how well anisya carried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happy ringing laughter and do you know she suddenly said i know that i shall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am now 
 rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought how charming this natasha of mine is i have no other friend like her and never shall have why should she marry we might always drive about together 
 what a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natasha 
 ah there are still lights in the drawingroom she said pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of the night

 of goodness goodness of nature 
 i take goodness in this sense the affecting of the weal of men which is that the 
 grecians call philanthropia and the word humanity as it is used is a little too 
 light to express it goodness i call the habit and goodness of nature the inclination 
 this of all virtues and dignities of the mind is the greatest being the character 
 of the deity and without it man is a busy mischievous wretched thing no better than a kind of vermin goodness answers to the theological virtue charity and admits no excess but error the desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall but in charity there is no excess neither can angel or man come in danger by it the inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man in so much that if it issue not towards men it will take unto other living creatures as it is seen in the turks a cruel people who nevertheless are kind to beasts and give alms to dogs and birds in so much as busbechius reporteth a christian boy in constantinople had like to have been stoned for gagging in a waggishness a long billed fowl errors indeed in this virtue of goodness or charity may be committed the italians have an ungracious proverb tanto buon che val niente so good that he is good for nothing and one of the doctors of italy nicholas machiavelli had the confidence to put in writing almost in plain terms that the christian faith had given up good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust which he spoke because indeed there was never law or sect or opinion did so much magnify goodness as the christian religion doth 
 therefore to avoid the scandal and the danger both it is good to take knowledge of the errors of an habit so excellent seek the good of other men but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies for that is but facility or softness which taketh an honest mind prisoner neither give thou cock a gem who would be better pleased and happier if he had had a barley corn 
 the example of god teacheth the lesson truly he sendeth his rain and maketh his sun to shine upon the just and unjust but he doth not rain wealth nor shine honour and virtues upon men equally common benefits are to be communicate with all but peculiar benefits with choice and beware how in making the portraiture thou breakest the pattern for divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern the love of our neighbours but the portraiture sell all thou hast and give it to me poor and follow me but sell not all thou hast except thou come and follow me that is except thou have a vocation wherein thou may do as much good with little means as with great for otherwise in 
 feeding the streams thou driest the fountain neither is there only a habit of 
 goodness directed by right reason but mere is in some men even in nature a 
 disposition towards it as on the other side there is a natural malignity 
 for there be that in their nature do not affect the good of others the lighter sort of malignity turneth but to a crossness or forwardness or aptness to oppose or difficultness or the like but the deeper sort to envy and mere mischief such men in other calamities are as it were in season and are ever on the loading part not so good as the dogs that licked sores but like flies that are still buzzing upon anything that is raw misanthropi that make it their practice to bring men to the bough and yet have never a tree for the purpose in their gardens as timon had 
 such dispositions are the very errors of human nature and yet they are the fittest 
 timber to make great politics of like to knee timber that is good for ships that 
 are ordained to be tossed but not for building houses that shall stand firm the 
 parts and signs of goodness are many if a man be gracious and courteous to strangers it shows he is a citizen of the world and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands but a continent that joins to them if he be compassionate towards the afflictions of others it shows mat his heart is like the noble tree that is wounded itself when it gives the balm if he easily pardons and remits offences it shows that his mind is planted above injuries so that he cannot be shot if he be thankful for small benefits it shows that he weighs minds and not their trash but above all if he have st perfection that he would wish to be an anathema from christ for the salvation of his brethren it shows much of a divine nature and a kind of conformity with christ himself

 book just man 
 chapter xii 
 
 the solitude of monseigneur welcome 
 a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes just as a general is by a covey of young officers this is what that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere les pretres callow priests 
 every career has its aspirants who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it there is no power which has not its dependents 
 there is no fortune which has not its court 
 the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present 
 every metropolis has its staff of officials every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary which goes the round and maintains good order in the episcopal palace and mounts guard over smile 
 to please a bishop is equivalent to getting foot in the stirrup for a it is necessary to walk path discreetly the apostleship does not disdain the canonship 
 just as there are bigwigs elsewhere there are big mitres in the church these are the bishops who stand well at court who are rich well endowed skilful accepted by the world who know how to pray no doubt but who know also how to beg who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy who are abbes rather than priests prelates rather than bishops happy those who approach them 
 being persons of influence they create a shower about them upon the assiduous and the favored and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing of large parishes prebends archidiaconates chaplaincies and cathedral posts while awaiting episcopal honors 
 as they advance themselves they cause their satellites to progress also it is a whole solar system on the march 
 their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite 
 their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes into nice little promotions 
 the larger the diocese of the patron the fatter the curacy for the favorite 
 and then there is rome 
 a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal carries you with him as conclavist you enter a court of papal jurisdiction you receive the pallium and behold you are an auditor then a papal chamberlain then monsignor and from a grace to an eminence is only a step and between the eminence and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot 
 every may dream of the tiara the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner and what a king the supreme king 
 then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary 
 how many blushing choristers how many youthful abbes bear on their heads pot of milk who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation in good faith perchance and deceiving itself devotee that it is 
 monseigneur bienvenu poor humble retiring was not accounted among the big mitres 
 this was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him 
 we have seen that he did not take in paris 
 not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man 
 not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow 
 his canons and were good old men rather vulgar like himself walled up like him in this diocese without exit to a cardinalship and who resembled their bishop with this difference that they were finished and he was completed 
 the impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well understood that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of aix or of auch and went off in a great hurry 
 for in short we repeat it men wish to be pushed 
 a saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor he might communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty an anchylosis of the joints which are useful in advancement and in short more renunciation than you desire and this infectious virtue is avoided 
 hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu 
 we live in the midst of a gloomy society success that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption 
 be it said in passing that success is a very hideous thing 
 its false resemblance to merit deceives men 
 for the masses success has almost the same profile as supremacy 
 success that menaechmus of talent has one 
 juvenal and tacitus alone grumble at it in our day a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service wears the livery of success and performs the service of its antechamber 
 succeed 
 theory 
 prosperity argues capacity win in the lottery and behold you are a clever man 
 he who triumphs is venerated 
 be born with a silver spoon in your mouth everything lies in that 
 be lucky and you will have all the rest be happy and people will think you great 
 outside of five or six immense exceptions which compose the splendor of a century contemporary admiration is nothing but gilding is gold 
 it does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance so long as you do arrive 
 the common herd is an old narcissus who adores himself and who applauds the vulgar herd 
 that enormous ability by virtue of which one is moses aeschylus dante michael angelo or napoleon the multitude awards on the spot and by acclamation to whomsoever attains his object in whatsoever it may consist let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy 
 let a false corneille compose tiridate let a eunuch come to possess a harem let a military prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch let an apothecary invent cardboard for the army of the and construct for himself out of this cardboard sold as leather four hundred thousand francs of income let a espouse usury and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions of which he is the father and of which it is the mother let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of men call that genius just as they call the face of mousqueton beauty and the mien of claude majesty 
 with the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks

 ann looks out across the floor and then seeing joe and irving waves irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement 
 on the bridge up above the dancing several cars pull up several men climb out rushing over to the steps the first secret service man smoking a cigarette watches the men approach the men walk over to the tables 
 ann continues dancing with mario who suddenly stops looking at her hair

 he stops thinking and then taking out a comb brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts he puts his comb away satisfied ann moves to touch her hair but mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing 
 one of the secret service men stands leaning against a structure swinging his hand to the beat smiling the man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down putting his hands in his pockets looking out again over the dancing 
 the music stops and everyone applauds the musicians 
 
 mario delani 
 thank you 
 
 the first secret service man comes over to ann then mario seeing him says something to ann in italian then bye and leaves her to him

 irving looks around from his drink and seeing the problem rushes after joe two of the secret service men drag ann away from the barges but joe catches them and pushes them away pushing one of them down and taking ann by the arm joe punches one man who tries to pull ann the other way but the other one manages to push irving over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water joe and ann run to the other side of the floor where the dancers have dispersed and are watching the action 
 joe sees more secret service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way cornered he confronts them as they close ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men having his beard pulled but responds to this with an angry punch to the face mario runs over his hair with his comb muttering some italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help joe the conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune the scene of chaos continues joe and irving and mario laying into the secret service men distracted two of the men manage to grab ann and drag her away joe runs after irving following with his camera 
 joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch freeing ann ann looks around her for a way to help picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at man joe keeps fighting with the man as ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him on a chair one of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head then swings it down hitting him full on the head stunning him for a moment 
 
 irving 
 excitedly trying to get his camera ready having missed the shot the first time 
 hit him again smithy 
 the drummer rolls again as ann swings the guitar back then releasing it and smashing it over the camera flashing as she does so 
 police sirens sound and the polizia arrive packed into their cars as they spill out joe ann and irving start to leave the scene leaving the secret service men staggering or lying about the dance floor dazed 
 
 irving 
 joe give me my car keys 
 
 joe 
 to irving he stops pointing at the police 
 police police 
 
 irving

 leia organa sat silently before the huge display screen on which yavin and its moonswere displayed a large red dot moved steadily toward the fourth of those and several other field commanders of the alliance stood behind her theireyes also intent on the screen tiny green flecks began to appear around the fourthmoon to coalesce into the small clouds like hovering emerald put a hand on her shoulder it was comforting the red represents theprogress of the imperial battle station as it moves deeper into system 
 our ships are all away a commander behind him declared 
 a single man stood alone in the cylindrical hold secured to the top of a tower staring through electrobinoculars he was the sole visiblerepresentative of the vast technology buried in the green purgatory below 
 muted cries moans and primeval gurglings drifted up to him from the highesttreetops some were frightening some less so but none were as indicative of powerheld in check as the four silvery starships which burst into view above the a tight formation they exploded through humid air to vanish in seconds intothe morning cloud cover far above rattled the trees moments a forlorn attempt to catch up to the engines which had produced them 
 slowly assuming attack formations combining x and ships the variousfighters began to move outward from the moon out past the oceanic atmosphere ofgiant yavin out to meet the technologic executioner 
 the man who had observed the between biggs and luke now loweredhis glare visor and adjusted his gunsights as he checkedthe ships to either side of him 
 blue boys he addressed his intership pickup this is blue leader adjustyour selectors and check in approaching target at one point three 
 ahead the bright sphere of what looked like on of moons but to glow with increasing brightness it shone with an eerie metallic glowutterly unlike that of any natural satellite as he watched the giant battle stationmake its way around the rim of yavin blue thoughts traveled back over theyears over the uncountable injustices the innocents taken away for interrogationand never heard from whole multitude of evils incurred by an increasinglycorrupt and indifferent imperial government all those terrors and agonies wereconcentrated magnified represented by the single bloated feat of engineering theywere approaching now 
 this is it boys he said to the mike blue two too far out close itup wedge 
 the young pilot luke had encountered in the temple briefing room glanced tostarboard then back to his instruments he executed a slight adjustment boss my ranger seems to be a few points off have to go on manual 
 check blue two watch yourself all ships stand by to lock inattack mode 
 one after another from luke and biggs wedge and the other members of blueassault squadron the replies came back standing by 
 execute blue leader commanded when john d and piggy had indicated theywere in readiness 
 the double wings on the fighters split apart like narrow seeds eachfighter now displayed four wings its armament and quadruple enginesnow deployed for maximum firepower and maneuverability 
 ahead they imperial station continued to grow surface features becamevisible as each pilot recognized docking bays broadcast antennae and other mountains and canyons 
 as he neared that threatening black sphere for the second time breathinggrew faster automatic machinery detected the respiratory shift andcompensated properly 
 something began to buffet his ship almost as if he were back in his skyhopperagain wrestling with the unpredictable winds of tatooine he experienced a badmoment of uncertainty until the calming voice of blue leader sounded in his ears 
 passing through their outer shields hold tight lock down controls and switch your own deflectors on double front 
 the shaking and buffeting continued worsened not knowing how tocompensate luke did exactly what he should have remained in control and followedorders then the turbulence was gone and the deathly cold peacefulness of spacehad returned 
 it through blue leader told them quietly keep all channelssilent until on top of them it look like expecting muchresistance 
 though half the great station remained in shadow they were now near enoughfor luke to be able to discern individual lights on its surface a ship that could showphases matching a moononce again he marveled at the misplaced ingenuity andeffort which had gone into its construction thousands of lights scattered across itscurving expanse gave it the appearance of a floating city 
 some of comrades since this was their first sight of the station wereeven more impressed look at the size of that thing wedge antilles gasped overhis open pickup 
 cut the chatter blue two blue leader ordered accelerate to attackvelocity 
 grim determination showed in expression as he flipped several switchesabove his head and began adjusting his computer target readout artoo detooreexamined the nearing station and thought untranslatable electronic thoughts 
 blue leader compared the station with the location of their proposed target leader he called toward the pickup this is blue leader in can go right in the exhaust shaft is farther to the north keep em busydown here 
 red leader was the physical opposite of squadron commander heresembled the popular notion of a credit slim shy of face hisskills and dedication however easily matched those of his counterpart and old friend 
 starting for the target shaft now dutch stand by to take over ifanything happens 
 check red leader came the reply going to cross theirequatorial axis and try to draw their main fire may the force be with you 
 from the approaching swarm two squads of fighters broke clear the dove directly for the bulge of the station far below while the curveddown and northward over its surface 
 within the station alarm sirens began a mournful clangorous wail as personnel realized that the impregnable fortress was actually under organizedattack admiral motti and his tacticians had expected the resistance to becentered around a massive defense of the moon itself they were completelyunprepared for an offensive response consisting of dozens of tiny snub ships 
 imperial efficiency was in the process of compensating for this strategicoversight soldiers scrambled to man enormous thrummed as powerful motors aligned the huge devices for a web of annihilation began to develop the station as energy weapons electricalbolts and explosive solids ripped out at the oncoming rebel craft 
 this is blue five luke announced to his mike as he nose dived his ship in theradical attempt to confuse any electronic predictors below the gray surface of thebattle station streaked past his ports going in 
 right behind you blue five a voice recognizable as sounded inhis ears 
 the target in sights was as stable as that of the imperial defenders wasevasive bolts flew from the tiny weapons one started a huge fire on thedim surface below which would burn until the crew of the station could shut off theflow of air to the damaged section 
 glee turned to terror as he realized he swerve his craft in time toavoid passing through the fireball of unknown composition pull out luke pullout biggs was screaming at him 
 but despite commands to shift course the automatic pressors allow thenecessary centrifugal force his father plunged into the expanding balls ofsuperheated gases 
 then he was through and clear on the other side a rapid check of his controlsenabled him to relax passage through the intense heat had been insufficient todamage anything all four wings bore streaks of black carbonizedtestimony to the nearness of his escape 
 bloomed outside his ship as he swung it up and around in a sharpcurve you all right luke came concerned query 
 i got a little toasted but okay 
 a different stern voice sounded blue five warned the squadron better give yourself more lead time or going to destroy yourself as wellas the imperial construction 
 yes sir got the hang of it now like you said not exactly likeflying a skyhopper 
 energy bolts and beams continued to create a chromatic maze in thespace above the station as the rebel fighters crisscrossed back and forth over itssurface firing at whatever looked like a decent target two of the tiny craftconcentrated on a power terminal it blew up throwing electric arcsfrom the innards 
 inside troopers mechanicals and equipment were blown in all directions bysubsidiary explosions as the effects of the blast traveled back down various conduitsand cables where the explosion had hulled the station escaping atmosphere suckedhelpless soldiers and droids out into a bottomless black tomb 
 moving from position to position a figure of dark calm amid the chaos wasdarth vader a harried commander rushed up to him and reported breathlessly 
 lord vader we count at least thirty of them of two types they are so smalland quick the fixed guns cannot follow them accurately they continuously evadethe predictors 
 get all tie crews to their fighters have to go out after them and destroythem ship by ship 
 within numerous hangars red lights began flashing and an insistent alarm startedto ring ground crews worked frantically to ready ships as imperialpilots grabbed for helmets and packs 
 luke requested blue leader as he skimmed smoothly through a rain of me know when off the block 
 on my way now 
 watch yourself the voice urged over the cockpit speaker a lot offire coming from the starboard side of that deflection tower 
 on it worry luke responded confidently putting his fighter into atwisting dive he sliced once more across metal horizons antennae and smallprotruding emplacements burst into transitory flame as bolts from his wing tips struckwith deadly accuracy 
 he grinned as he pulled up and away from the surface as intense lines of energypassed through space recently vacated darned if it like hunting home in the crumbling canyons of wastes 
 biggs followed luke on a similar run even as imperial pilots prepared to liftclear of the station within the many docking bays technical crews rushed hurriedlyto unlock power cables and conclude desperate final checks 
 more care was taken in preparing a particular craft nearest one of the bay one into which darth vader barely succeeded in squeezing his huge frame onceset in the seat he slid a second set of eye shields across his face 
 the atmosphere of the war room back in the temple was one of nervousexpectancy occasional blinks and buzzes from the main battle screen soundedlouder than the soft sussuration of hopeful people trying to reassure one a far corner of the mass of flickering lights a technician leaned a little closer tohis own readouts before speaking into the pickup suspended near his mouth 
 squad squad picked up a newset of signals from the other side of the station enemy fighters coming your way 
 luke received the report at the same time as everyone else he began huntingthe sky for the predicted imperial craft his gaze dropping to his negative i see anything 
 maintain visual scanning blue leader directed with all this energy be on top of you before your scope can pick them up remember they canjam every instrument on your ship except your eyes 
 luke turned again and this time saw an imperial already pursuing an with a number luke quickly recognized 
 biggs he shouted picked one up on your tailwatch it 
 i see it came his panicked response where is he i it 
 luke watched helplessly as ship shot away from the station surface andout into clear space closely followed by the imperial the enemy vessel firedsteadily at him each successive bolt seeming to pass a little closer to hull 
 on my tight the voice sounded in cockpit i shake him 
 twisting spinning biggs looped back toward the battle station but the pilottrailing him was persistent and showed no sign of relinquishing pursuit 
 hang on biggs luke called wrenching his ship around so steeply that thestraining gyros whined coming in 
 so absorbed in his pursuit of biggs was the imperial pilot that he see rotated his own ship flipped out of the concealing gray below and dropped inbehind him 
 electronic crosshairs lined up according to the luke fired repeatedly there was a small explosion in comparedwith the enormous energies being put out by the emplacements on the surface of thebattle station but the explosion was of particular significance to three people and most particularly to the pilot of the tie fighter who was vaporized withhis ship 
 got him luke murmured 
 got one got one came a less restrained cry of triumph over theopen intercom luke identified the voice as belonging to a young pilot known asjohn d yes that was blue six chasing another imperial fighter across the metallandscape bolts jumped from the in steady succession until the tie fighterblew in half sending glittering metal fragments flying in all directions 
 good shooting blue six the squadron leader commented then he addedquickly watch out got one on your tail 
 within the cockpit the gleeful smile on the young face vanishedinstantly as he looked around unable to spot his pursuer something flared brightlynearby so close that his starboard port burst then something hit even closer and theinterior of the now open cockpit became a mass of flames 
 hit hit 
 that was all he had time to scream before oblivion took him from behind farabove and to one side blue leader saw john ship expand in fiery ball his lipsmay have whitened slightly otherwise he might as well never have seen the for all the reaction he displayed he had more important things to do 
 on the fourth moon of yavin a spacious screen chose that moment to flicker anddie much as john d had worried technicians began rushing in all turned a drawn face to leia the expectant commanders and one tall bronzedrobot 
 the receiver has failed it will take some time to fix 
 do the best you can leia snapped switch to audio only 
 someone overheard and in seconds the room was filled with the sounds ofdistant battle interspersed with the voices of those involved 
 tighten it up blue two tighten it up blue leader was saying watch thosetowers 
 heavy fire boss came to the voice of wedge antilles degrees 
 i see it pull in pull in picking up some interference 
 i believe it biggs was stammering never seen such firepower 
 pull in blue five pull in a pause then luke do you read 
 all right chief came reply got a target going tocheck it out 
 too much action down there luke biggs told him get out doyou read me luke pull out 
 break off luke ordered the deeper tones of blue leader hit toomuch interference here luke i repeat break off i see him blue two doyou see blue five 
 negative wedge replied quickly a fire zone here you my jammed blue five where are you luke are you allright 
 gone biggs started to report solemnly then his voice rose he is looks like a little fin damage but the fine 
 relief swept the war room and it was most noticeable in the face of the beautiful senator present 
 on the battle station troopers worn half to death or deafened by the concussionof the big guns were replaced by fresh crews none of them had time to wonder howthe battle was going and at the moment none of them much cared a malady shared bycommon soldiers since the dawn of history 
 luke skimmed daringly low over the surface his attention riveted on adistant metal projection 
 stick close blue five the squadron commander directed him where areyou going 
 picked up what looks like a lateral stabilizer luke replied goingto try for it 
 watch yourself blue five heavy fire in your area 
 luke ignored the warning as he headed the fighter straight toward the oddlyshaped protuberance his determination was rewarded when after saturating it withfire he saw it erupt in a spectacular ball of superhot gas 
 got it he exclaimed continuing south for another one 
 within the rebel leia listened intently she seemedsimultaneously angry and frightened finally she turned to threepio and is luke taking so many chances the tall droid reply 
 watch your back luke voice sounded over the speakers watch yourback fighters above you coming in 
 leia strained to see what she could only hear she alone help threepio was whispering to himself and keep holding on 
 luke continued his dive even as he looked back and spotted the object of close on his tail reluctantly he pulled up and away from the station his target his tormentor was good however and continued closing onhim 
 i shake him he reported 
 something cut across the sky toward both ships on him luke shoutedwedge antilles hold on 
 luke have to for very long gunnery was precise and the tiefighter vanished brightly shortly thereafter 
 good shooting wedge that was biggs again blue four going me porkins 
 right with you blue three came the other assurance 
 biggs leveled them off let go with full weaponry no one ever decided exactlywhat it was he hit but the small tower that blew up under his energy bolts wasobviously more important than it looked 
 a series of sequential explosions hopscotched across a large section of the surface leaping from one terminal to the next biggs had already shot pastthe area of disturbance but his companion following slightly behind received a fulldose of whatever energy was running wild down there 
 got a problem porkins announced my running was an understatement every instrument on his control panels had abruptlygone berserk 
 blue four advised biggs blue four do you read 
 okay porkins replied i can hold her give me a little room to 
 too low his companion yelled pull up pull up 
 with his instrumentation not providing proper information and at the altitude hewas traveling ship was simple for one of the big clumsy gun emplacementsto track it did as its designers had intended it should demise was asglorious as it was abrupt 
 it was comparatively quiet near the pole of the battle station so intense andvicious had been blue and green assault on the equator that imperialresistance had concentrated there red leader surveyed the false peace withmournful satisfaction knowing it last for long 
 blue leader this is red leader he announced into his mike startingour attack run the exhaust port is located and marked no flak no enemy fightersup looks like get at least one smooth run at it 
 i copy red leader the voice of his counterpart responded try tokeep them busy down here 
 three fighters dropped out of the stars diving toward the at the last possible minute they swerved to dip into a deep artificial of many streaking the northern pole of the death star metal ramparts raced paston three sides of them 
 red leader hunted around notice the temporary absence of imperial adjusted a control and addressed his squadron 
 this is it boys remember when you think close go in closer beforeyou drop that rock switch all power to front deflector mind whatthey throw at your from the side we worry about that now 
 imperial crews lining the trench rudely awoke to the fact that their heretoforeignored section of the station was coming under attack they reacted speedily andsoon energy bolts were racing at the attacking ships in a steadily increasing on would explode near one of the onrushing jostling it withoutreal damage 
 a little aggressive they red two reported over his mike 
 red leader reacted quietly how many guns do you think red five 
 red five known casually to most of the rebel pilots as pops somehow managedto make an estimate of the defenses while simultaneously piloting his fighterthrough the growing hail of fire his helmet was battered almost to the point ofuselessness from the effects of more battles than anyone had a right to survive 
 say about twenty emplacements he finally decided some in the surfaceand some on the towers 
 red leader acknowledged the information with a grunt as he pulled visor down in front of his face explosions continued to rock thefighter switch to targeting computers he declared 
 red two came one reply computer locked in and getting a young rising excitement marked his reply 
 but the senior pilot among all the rebels red five was expectantly cool it sound like it from what he murmured half to himself nodoubt about it this is going to be some trick 
 unexpectedly all defensive fire from the surrounding emplacements eerie quiet clung to the trench as the surface continued to blur past the 
 this red two blurted looking around worriedly they 
 i like it growled red leader but there was noting to confuse theirapproach now no energy bolts to avoid 
 it was pops who was first to properly evaluate this seeming aberration on part stabilize your rear deflectors now watch for enemy fighters 
 you pinned it pops red leader admitted studying a readout here theycome three marks at 
 a mechanical voice continued to recite the shrinking distance to their target butit shrinking fast enough sitting ducks down here he observednervously 
 just have to ride it out the old man told them all we defendourselves and go for the target at the same time he fought down old reflexes as hisown screen revealed three tie fighters in precision formation diving almost verticallydown toward them 
 darth vader announced as he calmly adjusted hiscontrols the stars whipped past behind him take them myself cover me 
 red two was the first to die the young pilot never knowing what hit him neverseeing his executioner despite his experience red leader was on the verge ofpanic when he saw his wingman dissolve in flame 
 trapped down here no way to walls are too got to loosen it up somehow got 
 stay on target admonished an older voice stay on target 
 red leader took words like tonic but it was all he could do to ignore theclosing tie fighters as the two remaining continued to streak toward thetarget 
 above them vader permitted himself a moment of undisciplined pleasure as hereadjusted his targeting puter the rebel craft continued to travel a course again vader touched finger to fire control 
 something screeched in red helmet and fire started to consume hisinstrumentation no good he yelled into his pickup hit hit 
 a second exploded in a ball of vaporized metal scattering a few solidshards of debris across the trench this second loss proved too much even for redfive to take he manipulated controls and his ship commenced rising in a slowcurve out of the trench behind him the lead imperial fighter moved to follow 
 red five to blue leader he reported aborting run under heavy fire tiefighters dropped on us out of nowhere i 
 astern a silent remorseless enemy was touching a deadly button once first bolts struck just as pops had risen high enough to commence evasive he had pulled clear a few seconds too late 
 one energy beam seared his port engine igniting gas within the engine blewapart taking controls and stabilizing elements with it unable to compensate began a long graceful plunge toward the station surface 
 are you all right red five a troubled voice called over the intership system 
 lost tireelost dutch pops explained slowly tiredly they drop in behindyou and you maneuver in the trench your baby now so 
 it was the last message of many from a veteran 
 blue leader forced a crispness he feel into his voice as he tried to shuntaside the death of his old friend blue boys this is blue leader rendezvous atmark six point one all wings report in 
 blue leader this is blue ten i copy 
 blue two here wedge acknowledged coming toward you blue leader 
 luke was also waiting his turn to report when something beeped on his controlboard a glance backward confirmed the electronic warning as he spotted animperial fighter slipping in behind him 
 this is blue five he declared his ship wobbling as he tried to lose the tiefighter i have a problem here be right with you 
 he sent his ship into a steep dive toward the metal surface then cut sharply up toavoid a burst of defensive fire from emplacements below neither maneuver shookhis pursuit 
 i see you luke came a reassuring call from biggs stay with it 
 luke looked above below and to the sides but there was no sign of his energy bolts from his trailing assailant were passing uncomfortably close 
 blast it biggs where are you 
 something appeared not to the sides or behind but almost directly in front ofhim it was bright and moving incredibly fast and then it was firing just above completely by surprise the imperial fighter came apart just as its pilot realizedwhat had happened 
 luke turned for the rendezvous mark as biggs shot past overhead good fooled me too 
 just getting started his friend announced as he twisted his ship violently toavoid the fire from below he hove into view over shoulder and executed avictory roll just point me at the target 
 back alongside indifferent bulk dodonna finished an intense discussionwith several of his principal advisors then moved to the transmitter 
 blue leader this is base one your own attack prior tocommencement have your wingmen hold back and cover for you keep half ofyour group out of range to make the next run 
 copy base on the response came blue ten blue twelve join with me 
 two ships leveled off to flank the squadron commander blue leader checkedthem out satisfied that they were positioned properly for attack run he set thegroup to follow in case they should fail 
 blue five this is blue leader luke take blue two and three with up here out of their fire and wait for my signal to start your own run 
 copy blue leader luke acknowledged trying to slow his heart the force be with you biggs wedge close it up together the threefighters assumed a tight formation high above the firefight still raging between otherrebel craft of green and yellow squadrons and the imperial gunners below 
 the horizon ahead of blue leader as he commenced his approach tothe station surface blue ten blue twelve stay back until we spot those cover me 
 all three reached the surface leveled off then arced into the wingmen dropped farther and farther behind until blue leader was seeminglyalone in the vast gray chasm 
 no defensive fire greeted him as he raced toward the distant target he foundhimself looking around nervously checking and rechecking the same instruments 
 this look right he found himself muttering 
 blue ten sounded equally concerned you should be able to pick up the targetby now 
 i know the disruption down here is unbelievable i think my instrumentsare off is this the right trench 
 suddenly intense streaks of light began to shoot close by as the trench defensesopened up near misses shook the attackers at the far end of the trench a hugetower dominated the metal ridge vomiting enormous amounts of energy at thenearing ships 
 not going to be easy with that tower up there blue leader declared by to close up a little when i tell you 
 abruptly the energy bolts ceased and all was silent and dark in the trench onceagain this is it blue leader announced trying to locate the attack from abovethat had to be coming keep your eyes open for those fighters 
 all short and scopes are blank blue ten reported tensely toomuch interference here blue five can you see them from where you are 
 attention was riveted to the surface of the station no sign of rapidly moving points of light caught his eye there they are coming inpoint three five 
 blue ten turned and looked in the indicated direction sun bounced offstabilizing fins as the tie fighters looped downward i see them 
 the right trench all right blue leader exclaimed as his tracking scopesuddenly began a steady beeping he adjusted his targeting instrumentation pullingthe visor down over his eyes almost in range targets readycoming hold them off me for a few em busy 
 but darth vader was ready setting his own fire control as he dropped like a stonetoward the trench close up the formation take them myself 
 blue twelve went first both engines blown a slight deviation in flight pathand his ship slammed into the trench wall blue ten showed and drunkenly but could do little within the confines of those metal walls 
 i hold them long better fire while you can blue on you 
 the squadron commander was wholly absorbed in lining up two circles withinhis targeting visor almost home steady steady 
 blue ten glanced around frantically right behind me 
 blue leader was amazed at how calm he was the targeting device was partlyresponsible enabling him to concentrate on tiny abstract images to the exclusion ofall else helping him to shut out the rest of the inimical universe 
 almost there almost there he whispered then the two circles red and a steady buzzing sounded in his helmet torpedoes away torpedoesaway 
 immediately after blue ten let his own missiles loose both fighters pulled upsharply just clearing the end of the trench as several explosions billowed in theirwake 
 a hit done it blue ten shouted hysterically 
 blue reply was thick with disappointment no we go in they just exploded on the surface outside the shaft 
 disappointment killed them too as they neglected to watch behind pursuing imperial fighters continued up out of the fading light from the torpedoexplosions blue ten fell to precision fire then the dark lord changedcourse slightly to fall in behind the squadron commander 
 take the last one he announced coldly you two go back 
 luke was trying to pick the assault team out of the glowing gases below whenblue voice sounded over the communicator 
 blue five this is blue leader move into position luke start your low and wait until right on top of it not going to be easy 
 are you all right 
 on top of shake them 
 blue five to blue pack luke ordered go the three ships peeled offand plunged toward the trench sector 
 meanwhile vader finally succeeded in hitting his quarry a glancing bolt thatnonetheless started small intense explosions in one engine its r unit scrambledback toward the damaged wing and struggled to repair the crippled power plant 
 r shut off the main feed to starboard engine blue leaderdirected quietly staring resignedly at instruments which were running on tight this could get rough 
 luke saw that blue leader was in trouble right above you blueleader he declared turn to point oh five and cover for you 
 lost my upper starboard engine came the reply 
 come down for you 
 negative negative stay there and get set up for your attack run 
 sure all right 
 i think sostand by for a minute 
 actually it was somehow less than a minute before blue gyrating plowed into the surface of the station luke watched the huge explosiondissipate below him knowing without question its cause sensing fully for the firsttime the helplessness of his situation we just lost blue leader he murmuredabsently not particularly caring if his mike picked up the somber announcement 
 on yavin four leia organa rose from her chair and nervously began pacing theroom normally perfect nails were now jagged and uneven from nervous was the only indication of physical unease the anxiety visible in her expressionwas far more revealing of her feelings and anxiety and worry that filled the war roomon the announcement of blue death 
 can they go on she finally asked dodonna 
 the general replied with gentle resolve they must 
 but lost so many without blue or red leader how will theyregroup 
 dodonna was about to reply but held his words as more critical ones soundedover the speaker 
 close it up wedge luke was saying thousands of kilometers away are you 
 coming right behind you 
 wedge replied soon after okay boss in position 
 gaze went to leia he looked concerned 
 the three moved close together high above the battle studied his instruments and fought irritably with one control that appeared to bemalfunctioning 
 voice sounded in his ears it was a voice a familiar content confident and voice he had listened to intently on thedesert of tatooine and in the guts of the station below once upon a time 
 trust your feelings luke was all the voice said 
 luke tapped his helmet unsure whether he had heard anything or not this wasno time for introspection the steely horizon of the station tilted behind him 
 wedge biggs going in he hold his wingmen go in full mind finding the trench and then accelerating maybe that will keep thosefighters far enough behind us 
 stay far enough back to cover you biggs declared at that speed willyou be able to pull out in time 
 are you kidding luke sneered playfully as they began their dive toward thesurface be just like beggars canyon back home 
 right with you boss noted wedge emphasizing the title for the first go 
 at high speed the three slim fighters charged the glowing surface pulling outafter the last moment luke skimmed so close over the station hull that the tip ofone wing grazed a protruding antenna sending metal splinters flying instantly theywere enveloped in a meshwork of energy bolts and explosive projectiles itintensified as they dropped down into the trench we seemed to have upset them biggs chortled treating the deadly display ofenergy as though it were all a show being put on for their amusement 
 this is fine luke commented surprised at the clear view ahead i can seeeverything 
 wedge quite as confident as he studied his own readouts my scopeshows the tower but i make out the exhaust port it must be awfully you sure the computer can target it 
 it better biggs muttered 
 luke offer an was too busy holding a course through theturbulence produced by exploding bolts then as if on command the defensive fireceased he glanced around and up for sign of the expected tie fighters but sawnothing 
 his hand went to drop the targeting visor into position and for just a moment hehesitated then he swung it down in front of his eyes watch yourselves heordered his companions 
 what about the tower wedge asked worriedly 
 you worry about those fighter luke snapped worry about the tower 
 they rushed on closing on the target every second wedge stared upward andhis gaze suddenly froze here they point three 
 vader was setting his controls when one of his wingmen broke attack making their approach too never get out in time 
 stay with them vader commanded 
 going too fast to get a fix his other pilot announced with certainty 
 vader studied several readouts and found that his sensors confirmed the otherestimates still have to slow down before they reach that tower 
 luke contemplated the view in his targeting visor almost home secondspassed and the twin circlets achieved congruence his finger convulsed on the firingcontrol torpedoes away pull up pull up 
 two powerful explosions rocked the trench striking harmlessly far to one side ofthe minute opening three tie fighters shot out of the rapidly dissipating on the retreating rebels take them vader ordered softly 
 luke detected the pursuit at the same time as his companions wedge the only way shake them 
 the three ships dropped toward the station then abruptly raced off in threedifferent directions all three tie fighters turned and followed luke 
 vader fired on the crazily dodging ship missed and frowned to himself theforce is strong with this one strange take him myself 
 luke darted between defensive towers and wove a tight path around projectingdocking bays all to no avail a single remaining tie fighter stayed close energy bolt nicked one wing close by an engine it started to spark luke fought to compensate and retain full control 
 still trying to shake his persistent assailant he dropped back into a trench hit he announced but not bad artoo see what you can do with it 
 the tiny droid unlocked himself and moved to work on the damaged engine asenergy bolts flashed by dangerously close hang on back there luke counseledthe artoo unit as he worked a path around projecting towers the fighter spinning andtwisting tightly through the topography of the station 
 fire remained intense as luke randomly changed direction and speed a seriesof indicators on the control panel slowly changed color three vital gauges relaxed andreturned to where they belonged 
 i think got it artoo luke told him gratefully i just try to lock it down so it work loose again 
 artoo beeped in reply while luke studied the whirling panorama behind andabove them i think lost those fighters too blue group this is blue you clear he manipulated several controls and the shot out of thetrench still followed by emplacement fire 
 up here waiting boss wedge announced from his position high above thestation i see you 
 on my way blue three are you clear biggs 
 had some trouble his friend explained but i think i lost him 
 something showed again damnably on screen a glance behindshowed the tie fighter that had been chasing him for the past several minutesdropping in once more behind him he swung down toward the station again 
 nope not yet biggs told the others hold on luke be right there 
 a thin mechanical voice sounded over the speakers hold on artoo hangon back at the temple headquarters threepio turned away from the curioushuman faces which had turned to stare at him 
 as luke soared high above the station another swung in close to recognized ship and began hunting around anxiously for his friend 
 goin in up biggs are you all right biggs therewas no sign of the other fighter wedge do you see him anywhere 
 within the transparent canopy of the fighter bobbing close by a helmeted headshook slowly nothing wedge told him over the communicator wait a littlelonger show 
 luke looked around worried studied several instruments then came to adecision we wait got to go now i think he made it 
 hey you guys a cheerful voice demanded to another ship racing past andslowing slightly ahead of him ever give up on old biggs the intercomdirected as the figure in the ahead looked back at them 
 within the central control room of the battle station a harried officer rushed upto a figure studying the great battle screen and waved a handful of printout at him 
 sir completed an analysis of their attack plan there is a we break off the engagement or make plans to evacuate your ship isstanding by 
 governor tarkin turned an incredulous gaze on the officer who shrank he roared at our moment of triumph we are about to destroy thelast remnants of the alliance and you call for evacuation you overestimate theirchances badlynow get out 
 overwhelmed by the fury the subdued officer turned and retreatedfrom the room 
 going in luke declared as he commenced his dive toward the and biggs followed just aft 
 a voice he had heard before sounded inside his head againhe tapped his helmet and looked around it sounded as if the speaker were standingjust behind him but there was nothing only silent metal and nonverbalinstrumentation puzzled luke turned back to his controls 
 once more energy bolts reached out for them passing harmlessly on both sidesas the surface of the battle station charged up into his face but the defensive the cause of the renewed trembling luke suddenly experienced severalcritical gauges were beginning their swing back into the danger zone again 
 he leaned toward the pickup artoo those stabilizing elements must havebroken loose again see if you lock it back got to have fullcontrol 
 ignoring the bumpy ride the energy beams and explosions lighting space aroundhim the little robot moved to repair the damage 
 additional tireless explosions continued to buffet the three fighters as theydropped into the trench biggs and wedge dropped behind to cover for luke as hereached to pull down the targeting visor 
 for the second time a peculiar hesitation swept through him his hand wasslower yet as he finally pulled the device down in front of his eyes almost as if thenerves were in conflict with one another as expected the energy beams stopped asif on signal and he was barreling down the trench unchallenged 
 here we go again wedge declared as he spotted three imperial fightersdropping down on them 
 biggs and wedge began crossing behind luke trying to draw the coming fireaway from him and confuse their pursuers one tie fighter ignored the to gain inexorably on the rebel ships 
 luke stared into the targeting reached up slowly to move it a long minute he pondered the deactivated instrument staring at it as ifhypnotized then he slid it sharply back in front of his face and studied the tinyscreen as it displayed the shifting relationship of the to the nearing exhaustport 
 hurry luke biggs called out as he wrenched his ship in time to narrowlyavoid a powerful beam coming in faster this time we hold themmuch longer 
 with inhuman precision darth vader depressed the fire control of his fighteragain a loud desperate shout sounded over the speakers blending into a finalagonized scream of flesh and metal as fighter burst into a billion glowingsplinters that rained down on the bottom of the trench 
 wedge heard the explosion over his speakers and hunted frantically behind himfor the trailing enemy ship we lost biggs he yelled toward his own pickup 
 luke reply immediately his eyes were watering and he angrily wipedthem clear they were blurring his view of the targeting readout 
 a couple of shooting stars biggs he whispered huskily and be stopped his ship rocked slightly from a near miss and he directed hiswords to his remaining wingman biting down hard on the end of each sentence 
 close it up wedge you do any more good back there artoo try togive me a little more power on our rear reflectors 
 the artoo unit hurried to comply as wedge pulled up alongside trailing tie fighters also increased their speed 
 on the leader vader informed his soldiers take the other one 
 luke flew just in front of wedge slightly to port side energy bolts from thepursuing imperials began to streak close about them both men crossed each repeatedly striving to present as confusing a target as possible 
 wedge was fighting with his controls when several small flashes and sparks lithis control board one small panel exploded leaving molten slag he managed to retain control of the ship 
 got a bad malfunction luke i stay with you 
 okay wedge get clear 
 wedge mumbled a heartfelt sorry and peeled up out of the trench 
 vader concentrating his attention on the one ship remaining before him fired 
 luke see the explosion which burst close behind him nordid he have time to examine the smoking shell of twisted metal which now rodealongside one engine the arms went limp on the little droid 
 all three tie fighters continued to chase the remaining down the was only a matter of moments before one of them caught the bobbing fighter with acrippling burst except now there were only two imperial pursuing the third hadbecome an expanding cylinder of decomposing debris bits and pieces of whichslammed into the walls of the canyon 
 remaining wingman looked around in panic for the source of the same distortion fields that confused rebel instrumentation now did likewise to thetwo tie fighters 
 only when the fighter fully eclipsed the sun forward did the new threat becomevisible it was a corellian transport far larger than any fighter and it was divingdirectly at the trench but it move precisely like a freighter somehow 
 whoever was piloting that vehicle must have been unconscious or out of hismind the wingman decided wildly he adjusted controls in an attempt to avoid theanticipated collision the freighter swept by just overhead but in missing it thewingman slid too far to one side 
 a small explosion followed as two huge fins of the paralleling tie fightersintersected screaming uselessly into his pickup the wingman fluttered toward thenear trench wall he never touched it his ship erupting in flame before contact 
 to the other side darth fighter began spinning by the dark desperate glower various controls and instrumentsgave back readings which were brutally truthful completely out of control the tinyship continued spinning in the opposite direction from the destroyed the endless reaches of deep space 
 whoever was at the controls of the supple freighter was neither unconscious perhaps slightly touched but fully in command nonetheless it soaredhigh above the trench turning to run protectively above luke 
 all clear now kid a familiar voice informed him now blow thisthing so we can all go home 
 this pep talk was followed by a reinforcing grunt which could only have beenproduced by a particularly large wookie 
 luke looked up through the canopy and smiled but his smile faded as heturned back to the targeting visor there was a tickling inside his head 
 luketrust me the tickle requested forming words for the third time hestared into the targeter the emergency exhaust port was sliding toward the firingcircle again as it had once missed he hesitated but only brieflythis time then shoved the targeting screen aside closing his eyes he appeared tomumble to himself as if in internal conversation with something unseen with theconfidence of a blind man in familiar surroundings luke moved a thumb over severalcontrols then touched one soon after a concerned voice filled the cockpit from theopen speakers 
 base one to blue five your targeting device is switched off wrong 
 nothing luke murmured barely audible nothing 
 he blinked and cleared his eyes had he been asleep looking around hesaw that he was out of the trench and shooting back into open space a glanceoutside showed the familiar shape of han ship shadowing him another atthe control board indicated that he had released his remaining torpedoes although remember touching the firing stud still he must have 
 the cockpit speakers were alive with excitement you did it you did was shouting over and over i think they went right in 
 good shot kid solo complimented him having to raise his voice to be heardover unrestrained howling 
 distant muted rumblings shook ship an omen of incipient success hemust have fired the torpedoes he gradually he regained his composure 
 gladyou were here to see it now get some distance between us andthat thing before it goes i hope wedge was right 
 several and one freighter accelerated awayfrom the battle station racing toward the distant curve of yavin 
 behind them small flashes of fading light marked the receding station withoutwarning something appeared in the sky in place of it which was brighter than theglowing gas giant brighter than its sun for a few seconds the eternal nightbecame day no one dared look directly at it not even multiple shields set on highcould dim that awesome flare 
 space filled temporarily with trillions of microscopic metal fragments propelledpast the retreating ships by the liberated energy of a small artificial sun thecollapsed residue of the battle station would continued to consume itself for severaldays forming for that brief span of time the most impressive tombstone in this cornerof the cosmos

 when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was already growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming at once when she heard the young discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there 
 boris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the glass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about to call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she hardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and muttering angrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her and remained in her hiding place watching as under an invisible cap to see what went on in the world she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herself kept looking round toward the door it opened and nicholas came in 
 sonya what is the matter with you how can you said he running up to her 
 nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonya 
 ah i know what it is 
 well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her 
 look here how can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand 
 sonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirring and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes what will happen now thought she 
 sonya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything said nicholas and i will prove it to you 
 i like you to talk like that 
 well then i only forgive me sonya he drew her to him and kissed her 
 oh how nice thought natasha and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her 
 boris come here said she with a sly and significant look i have something to tell you here here and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding 
 boris followed her smiling 
 what is the something asked he 
 she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs picked it up 
 kiss the doll said she 
 boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not reply 
 you want to well then come here said she and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll closer closer she whispered 
 she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face 
 and me would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from excitement 
 boris blushed 
 how funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still more but he waited and did nothing 
 suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing back her hair kissed him full on the lips 
 then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood hanging her head 
 natasha he said you know that i love you but 
 you are in love with me natasha broke in 
 yes i am but please let us do like that in another four years then i will ask for your hand 
 natasha considered 
 thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender little fingers all right then settled 
 a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face 
 settled replied boris 
 forever said the little girl till death itself 
 she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room

 chapter 
 
 for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of knew no limits in gratitude and joy when life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self 
 the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march mr linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together 
 these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone 
 the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full catherine last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you 
 i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then leave me and i shall remain for ever next spring long again to have me under this roof and look back and think you were happy today 
 linton lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest words but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene the master told me to light a fire in the parlour and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on arm ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a gripe by the birth of an heir 
 i should mention that isabella sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with heathcliff it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it linton did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon read it for i keep it yet any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living 
 dear ellen it begins 
 i came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine has been and is yet very ill i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you 
 inform edgar that give the world to see his face my heart returned to thrushcross grange in hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine i follow it words are underlined they need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection 
 the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone i want to ask you two questions the first did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here i cannot recognize any sentiment which those around share with me 
 the second question i have great interest in it is mr heathcliff a man if so is he mad and if not is he a devil i tell my reasons for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen very soon write but come and bring me something from edgar 
 now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream 
 the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the gardens and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse and your old joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his under lip and turn away then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle 
 heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the dingy untidy hole i dare say you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth 
 this is legal nephew i in a manner i must shake hands must kiss him it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning 
 i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist said how do you do my dear he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend shall you and i be friends hareton was my next essay at conversation 
 an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance 
 hey throttler lad whispered the little wretch rousing a bulldog from its lair in a corner now wilt tuh be ganging he asked authoritatively 
 love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter mr heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and replied 
 mim mim mim did iver christian body hear aught like it minching un munching how can aw tell whet ye say 
 i say i wish you to come with me into the house i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness 
 nor nuh me i getten summat else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt 
 i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eyes too were like a ghostly with all their beauty annihilated 
 your business here he demanded grimly who are you 
 my name was isabella linton i replied seen me before sir lately married to mr heathcliff and he has brought me suppose by your permission 
 is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf 
 came just now i said but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bulldog 
 well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him 
 i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and refastened the door there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewter dishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr earnshaw vouchsafed no answer he walked up and down with his hands in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again 
 not be surprised ellen at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four miles i could not overpass them i questioned with must i turn for comfort you tell edgar or every sorrow beside this rose despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling 
 i sat and thought a doleful time the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals i listened to detect a voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping i was not aware how openly i grieved till earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of surprise taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimed 
 tired with my journey and i want to go to bed where is the maidservant direct me to her as she come to me 
 we have none he answered you must wait on yourself 
 where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness 
 joseph will show you chamber said he open that in there 
 i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tone 
 be so good as to turn your lock and draw your omit it 
 well i said but why mr earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff 
 look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol having a spring knife attached to the barrel a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door if once i find it open done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the times comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him 
 i surveyed the weapon inquisitively a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment 
 i care if you tell him said he put him on his guard and watch for him you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you 
 what has heathcliff done to you i asked in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred it be wiser to bid him quit the house 
 no thundered earnshaw should he offer to leave me a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton to be a beggar oh damnation i will have it back and have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before 
 acquainted me ellen with your old habits he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least i shuddered to be near him and thought on the moroseness as comparatively agreeable he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply make the porridge i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit mr earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve 
 gooid lord he muttered sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle if tuh be fresh when aw gettin used tuh two maisters if aw mun hev a mistress set my heead loike time tuh be flitting aw niver did think tuh say t day ut aw mud lave th owld aw daht nigh at hend 
 this lamentation drew no notice from me i went briskly to work sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition the quicker the thible ran round and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation 
 thear he ejaculated hareton thah willut sup thy porridge tuh neight be nowt bud lumps as big as maw nave thear agean fling in bowl un all if aw wer yah there pale t guilp off un then hae done bang bang a marcy t bothom deaved aht 
 it was rather a rough mess i own when poured into the basins four had been provided and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy which hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip i expostulated and desired that he should have his in a mug affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety assuring me repeatedly that the barn was every bit as good as i and every bit as wollsome and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking and glowered at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug 
 i shall have my supper in another room i said have you no place you call a parlour 
 parlour he echoed sneeringly parlour nay noa parlours if yah dunnut loike wer company un if yah dunnut loike maister us 
 then i shall go upstairs i answered show me a chamber i put my basin on a tray and went myself to fetch some more milk with great grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent we mounted to the garrets he opening a door now and then to look into the apartments we passed 
 a rahm he said at last flinging back a cranky board on hinges weel eneugh tuh ate a few porridge in a pack o corn i t corner thear meeterly clane if feared uh muckying yer grand silk cloes spread yer hankerchir o t top 
 the rahm was a kind of smelling strong of malt and grain various sacks of which articles were piled around leaving a wide bare space in the middle 
 why man i exclaimed facing him angrily this is not a place to sleep in i wish to see my bedroom 
 he repeated in a tone of mockery see all t thear mine 
 he pointed into the second garret only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls and having a large low curtainless bed with an quilt at one end 
 what do i want with yours i retorted i suppose mr heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house does he 
 oh maister wenting cried he as if making a new discovery ye uh said soa at onst un then aw mud uh telled ye baht all this wark ut just one yah cannut alias keeps it locked un iver mells but hisseln 
 a nice house joseph i could not refrain from observing and pleasant inmates and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs however that is not to the present are other rooms for sake be quick and let me settle somewhere 
 he made no reply to this adjuration only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps and halting before an apartment which from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture i conjectured to be the best one there was a carpet a good one but the pattern was obliterated by dust a fireplace hung with cut paper dropping to pieces a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make but they had evidently experienced rough usage the valances hung in festoons wrenched from their rings and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side causing the drapery to trail upon the floor the chairs were also damaged many of them severely and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession when my fool of a guide announced this here is t my supper by this time was cold my appetite gone and my patience exhausted i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose 
 whear the divil began the religious elder the lord bless us the lord forgie us whear the hell wold ye gang ye marred wearisome nowt yah seen all bud bit uf a not another hoile tuh lig dahn in i th hahse 
 i was so vexed i flung my tray and its contents on the ground and then seated myself at the hid my face in my hands and cried 
 ech ech exclaimed joseph weel done miss cathy weel done miss cathy hahsiver t maister sail just them brocken pots un then hear summut hear hah tuh be madling yah desarve pining froo this to churstmas flinging t precious gifts uh god under fooit i yer flaysome rages bud if yah shew yer sperrit lang will hathecliff bide sich bonny ways think ye aw nobbut wish he muh cotch ye i that plisky aw nobbut wish he may 
 and so he went on scolding to his den beneath taking the candle with him and i remained in the dark the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath and bestirring myself to remove its effects an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler whom i now recognized as a son of our old skulker it had spent its whelphood at the grange and was given by my father to mr hindley i fancy it knew me it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute and then hastened to devour the porridge while i groped from step to step collecting the shattered earthenware and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket handkerchief our labours were scarcely over when i heard tread in the passage my assistant tucked in his tail and pressed to the wall i stole into the nearest doorway the endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful as i guessed by a scutter downstairs and a prolonged piteous yelping i had better luck he passed on entered his chamber and shut the door directly after joseph came up with hareton to put him to bed i had found shelter in room and the old man on seeing me said 
 rahm for boath ye un yer pride now i sud think i the hahse empty ye may hev it all to yerseln un him as allas maks a third i such ill company 
 gladly did i take advantage of this intimation and the minute i flung myself into a chair by the fire i nodded and slept my slumber was deep and sweet though over far too soon mr heathcliff awoke me he had just come in and demanded in his loving manner what i was doing there i told him the cause of my staying up so he had the key of our room in his pocket the adjective our gave mortal offence he swore it was not nor ever should be mine and not repeat his language nor describe his habitual conduct he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear yet i assure you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens he told me of illness and accused my brother of causing it promising that i should be proxy in suffering till he could get hold of him 
 i do hate am have been a fool beware of uttering one breath of this to anyone at the grange i shall expect you every disappoint me

 chapter thirteen 
 
 laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself staring up into the green gloom of the trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition 
 what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river 
 well cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they be going in the boat for they got the key perhaps they forgot it take it to them and see going on 
 though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when leaped the fence and ran after them taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets 
 a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking and already 
 it was a rather pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things with them amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud a shadow passed over the face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit he stood so still that a squirrel busy with harvesting ran dawn a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile 
 may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly 
 meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may we should have asked you before only we thought you care for such a game as this 
 i always like your games but if meg want me go away 
 no objection if you do something against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously 
 much obliged do anything if let me stop a bit for as dull as the desert of sahara down there shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears ready and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold 
 finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book 
 was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the busy bee society 
 the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit 
 please could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one 
 would you tell him asked meg of her sisters 
 laugh said amy warningly 
 who cares said jo 
 i guess like it added beth 
 of course i shall i give you my word i laugh tell away jo and be afraid 
 the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer 
 yes i know said laurie nodding wisely 
 who told you demanded jo 
 spirits 
 no i did i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal he did like it so scold jo said beth meekly 
 you keep a secret never mind it saves trouble now 
 go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased 
 oh she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we dawdle 
 yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days mother likes to have us as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time 
 jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky the sun was low and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city 
 how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind 
 often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it 
 jo talks about the country where we hope to live real country she means with pigs and chickens and would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly 
 there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go when we are good enough answered meg with her sweetest voice 
 it seems so long to wait so hard to do i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate 
 get there beth sooner or later no fear of that said jo the one that will have to fight and work and climb and wait and maybe never get in after all 
 have me for company if any comfort i shall have to do a deal of traveling before i come in sight of your celestial city if i arrive late say a good word for me you beth 
 something in the face troubled his little friend but she said cheerfully with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds if people really want to go and really try all their lives i think they will get in for i believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate i always imagine it is as it is in the picture where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river 
 it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them said jo after a little pause 
 made such quantities it would be hard to choose which have said laurie lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him 
 have to take your favorite one what is it asked meg 
 if i tell mine will you tell yours 
 yes if the girls will too 
 we will now laurie 
 after seen as much of the world as i want to like to settle in germany and have just as much music as i choose to be a famous musician myself and all creation is to rush to hear me and never to be bothered about money or business but just enjoy myself and live for what i like my favorite castle yours meg 
 margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers and waved a brake before her face as if to disperse imaginary gnats while she said slowly i should like a lovely house full of all sorts of luxurious food pretty clothes handsome furniture pleasant people and heaps of money i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit how i should enjoy it for i be idle but do good and make everyone love me dearly 
 you have a master for your castle in the air asked laurie slyly 
 i said pleasant people you know and meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke so that no one saw her face 
 why you say have a splendid wise good husband and some angelic little children you know your castle be perfect without said blunt jo who had no tender fancies yet and rather scorned romance except in books 
 have nothing but horses inkstands and novels in yours answered meg petulantly 
 i though have a stable full of arabian steeds rooms piled high with books and write out of a magic inkstand so that my works should be as famous as music i want to do something splendid before i go into my castle something heroic or wonderful that be forgotten after dead i know what but on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all some day i think i shall write books and get rich and famous that would suit me so that is my favorite dream 
 mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother and help take care of the family said beth contentedly 
 you wish for anything else asked laurie since i had my little piano i am perfectly satisfied i only wish we may all keep well and be together nothing else 
 i have ever so many wishes but the pet one is to be an artist and go to rome and do fine pictures and be the best artist in the whole world was modest desire 
 an ambitious set we every one of us but beth wants to be rich and famous and gorgeous in every respect i do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes said laurie chewing grass like a meditative calf 
 got the key to my castle in the air but whether i can unlock the door remains to be seen observed jo mysteriously 
 got the key to mine but not allowed to try it hang college muttered laurie with an impatient sigh 
 mine and amy waved her pencil 
 i got any said meg forlornly 
 yes you have said laurie at once 
 where 
 in your face 
 nonsense of no use 
 wait and see if it bring you something worth having replied the boy laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew 
 meg colored behind the brake but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which mr brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight 
 if we are all alive ten years hence meet and see how many of us have got our wishes or how much nearer we are then than now said jo always ready with a plan 
 bless me how old i shall be exclaimed meg who felt grown up already having just reached seventeen 
 you and i will be teddy beth and amy what a venerable party said jo 
 i hope i shall have done something to be proud of by that time but such a lazy dog afraid i shall dawdle jo 
 you need a motive mother says and when you get it she is sure work splendidly 
 is she by jupiter i will if i only get the chance cried laurie sitting up with sudden energy i ought to be satisfied to please grandfather and i do try but working against the grain you see and comes hard he wants me to be an india merchant as he was and rather be shot i hate tea and sild and spices and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring and i care how soon they go to the bottom when i own them going to college ought to satisfy him for if i give him four years he ought to let me off from the business but set and got to do just as he did unless i break away and please myself as my father did if there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman do it tomorrow 
 laurie spoke excitedly and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation for he was growing up very fast and in spite of his indolent ways had a young hatred of subjection a young restless longing to try the world for himself 
 i advise you to sail away in one of your ships and never come home again till you have tried your own way said jo whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit and whose sympathy was excited by what she called wrongs 
 not right jo you talk in that way and take your bad advice you should do just what your grandfather wishes my dear boy said meg in her most maternal tone do your best at college and when he sees that you try to please him sure he be hard on you or unjust to you as you say there is no one else to stay with and love him and never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission be dismal or fret but do your duty and get your reward as good mr brooke has by being respected and loved 
 what do you know about him asked laurie grateful for the good advice but objecting to the lecture and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak 
 only what your grandpa told us about him how he took good care of his own mother till she died and go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he leave her and how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother and never tells anyone but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be 
 so he is dear old fellow said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story like grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know and to tell all his goodness to others so that they might like him brooke understand why your mother was so kind to him asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style if ever i do get my wish you see what do for booke 
 begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out said meg sharply 
 how do you know i do miss 
 i can always tell by his face when he goes away if you have been good he looks satisfied and walks briskly if you have plagued him sober and walks slowly as if he wanted to go back and do his work better 
 well i like that so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in face do you i see him bow and smile as he passes your window but i know got up a telegraph 
 we be angry and oh tell him i said anything it was only to show that i cared how you get on and what is said here is said in confidence you know cried meg much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech 
 i tell tales replied laurie with his high and mighty air as jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore only if brooke is going to be a thermometer i must mind and have fair weather for him to report 
 please be offended i meant to preach or tell tales or be silly i only thought jo was encouraging you in a feeling which be sorry for you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think forgive me i meant it kindly and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid 
 ashamed of his momentary pique laurie squeezed the kind little hand and said frankly the one to be forgiven cross and have been out of sorts all day i like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly so mind if i am grumpy sometimes i thank you all the same 
 bent on showing that he was not offended he made himself as agreeable as possible wound cotton for meg recited poetry to please jo shook down cones for beth and helped amy with her ferns proving himself a fit person to belong to the busy bee society in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea to draw and they would just have time to get home to supper 
 may i come again asked laurie 
 yes if your are good and love your book as the boys in the primer are told to do said meg smiling 
 try 
 then you may come and teach you to knit as the scotchmen do a demand for socks just now added jo waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate 
 that night when beth played to mr laurence in the twilight laurie standing in the shadow of the curtain listened to the little david whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit and watched the old man who sat with his gray head on his hand thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much remembering the conversation of the afternoon the boy said to himself with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully let my castle go and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me for i am all he has

 mess imhotep grins says something in ancient egyptian then 
 starts to strangle chokes about to die 
 evelyn turns and faces imhotep and reads an inscription 
 evelyn 
 kadeesh mal kadeesh mal 
 pared oos pared oos 
 imhotep pivots and looks at evelyn a look of sheer terror 
 on his face then he looks over at the detritus bog which 
 starts to bubble and shift the swirling hole begins to open 
 and then suddenly the spirits of the egyptian gods waft out 
 of the black bog and swirl around the the 
 mummies all collapse and turn to dust and then the spirits 
 attack imhotep lifting him and up into the air 
 imhotep go of who falls to the ground 
 evelyn and jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits 
 jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws the book of 
 the living into the detritus bog evelyn watches as the 
 golden book sinks into the black putrescence jonathan looks 
 like about to cry 
 ten feet off the ground the spirits swirl around 
 body twisting it and turning it and slowly shriveling it 
 accompanied by the same strange flashing light we saw at the 
 beginning of the movie when was cursed one 
 last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and imhotep 
 is spit out and thrown to the floor he staggers to his feet 
 he looks perfectly normal his body is completely intact 
 swings his sword imhotep jerks back the sword 
 scrapes chest a swath of blood appears across 
 chest where the sword hit him imhotep touches the 
 blood on his chest amazed and horrified mortal 
 runs imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
 backwards imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
 bog the sword still in his stomach 
 evelyn and jonathan run up next to they watch as 
 imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp slowly dying and 
 then just before his head goes under imhotep looks up at 
 them grins broadly and says something in ancient egyptian 
 evelyn translates 
 evelyn 
 death is only the beginning 
 grinning face vanishes under the black bile 
 staff chamber day 
 beni staggers across a chamber straining under the weight 
 of another saddlebag filled with treasure he spots a large 
 ornate staff sticking out of a wall he throws the saddlebag 
 over the staff and collapses against the wall exhausted 
 a beat and then the weight of the treasure pulls the staff 
 down which starts a massive aural 
 away from the wall filled with fear 
 all the walls start to sink into the ground driven by tons 
 of pouring sand beni turns and out of the chamber 
 cemetery day 
 evelyn and jonathan look around as all the walls 
 start to descend grabs hand 
 
 
 he pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
 pillars they duck as they run into a descending doorway 
 int passageway day 
 beni scampers down a passageway the ceiling getting lower 
 and lower until he has to crouch and then he has to stick 
 the torch between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees 
 int treasure chamber day 
 evelyn and jonathan into the treasure 
 chamber evelyn skids to a stop looks in wonder at all the 
 treasure sand rains down on them grabs her again 
 and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
 a sinking doorway on the far side of the room the sound of 
 the sinking walls is deafening 
 beni into the treasure chamber evelyn 
 and jonathan race past him he joins them as they run up a 
 staircase heading for a descending doorway which is already 
 half gone now only four feet high now three feet 
 high now two feet jonathan dives through the narrow gap 
 then dives through he spins around evelyn dives 
 but gets stuck in the middle about to get cut in half 
 grabs her arm and yanks her through in the nick of 
 time beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand 
 beni 
 
 grabs it but too late beni yanks his hand 
 back just as the top of the door crashes to the floor 
 sealing him in beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
 the ceiling slams down behind him he stands up and looks 
 around with his diminishing torch 
 all the doorways finish closing no way out 
 trapped and then he hears something and turns around over 
 in the corner a stares at him chittering 
 beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away 
 beni 
 go away 
 he stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
 upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him 
 beni is absolutely terrified the scarabs start to move in 
 and when torch goes out pitch black a beat 
 and then we hear beni start screaming in horror and pain 
 and the scarabs chittering hungrily 
 ext hamunaptra day 
 the temple collapses as evelyn jonathan and a 
 pack of stray camels race through the ruins a sinking 
 crevice drops out right behind them chasing them out through 
 the front gates the whole place rumbles ominously 
 they make it down the ramp as more ruins crash down behind 
 them a massive cloud of sand and dust billows out over the 
 wall and into the air our heroes and all the stray camels 
 race out into the desert 
 slow dissolve to 
 ext platealt day 
 evelyn and jonathan stand in the middle of the 
 plateau surrounded by stray camels they stare off at the 
 sandy dusty volcano as it continues to

 evelyn returns the look a beat and then she 
 arms around his neck and kisses him ret urn s it 
 jonathan just rolls his eyes snorts in disgust and climbs 
 up onto a camel 
 when the kiss and evelyn share a smile 
 then leaps up into the saddle reaches down grabs 
 hand and pulls her up behind him evelyn wraps her 
 arms around his waist and jonathan slap the reins 
 
 
 the camels start to move out we pan down to the saddlebag 
 behind evelyn hidden under the closed back flap we can

 roman holiday 
 part 
 
 evening it is dark music greets joe and ann as they walk down the steps on the way to the barges he pays the ticketseller as ann stands watching the dancing across the river 
 
 joe 
 to the ticketseller 
 grazzi 
 
 he walks over to ann smiling to her and they continue 
 they walk onto the dance floor and start dancing 
 two men in black suits and service out over the people one of them turns to watch the dance floor and notices joe and ann watching them as they dance the secret service man stands on his feet and the other looks over at what he is watching as the music stops for the next song the man speaks some italian to the other who leaves and continues watching as the next dance starts the other man runs back towards the steps away from the dancers 
 joe and ann continue now as it is a slower song she rests her head on his shoulder her eyes closed and smiling she looks up at him 
 
 ann 
 hello 
 
 joe 
 as they look at each other 
 hello 
 joe smiles as she rests her head against his chest and they continue 
 the band finishes the dance and the audience claps the dancers on the floor dispersing joe and ann walk over to the side of the floor 
 
 ann 
 looking up to him as she sits down 
 mr bradley if you mind my saying so i think you are a ringer 
 
 joe 
 confused 
 oh wha 
 
 understanding smiling sitting down 
 oh thanks very much 
 
 ann

 joe 
 guiltily 
 i know seemed the thing to do 
 
 ann 
 i never heard of anybody so kind 
 
 joe 
 he looks down hiding his guilt 
 any trouble 
 
 ann 
 also completely unselfish 
 
 joe 
 joe looks over to the other side of the barge motioning to ann 
 have a drink at the bar 
 
 joe takes her hand and they walk over 
 
 mario delani 
 turns to ann smiling 
 oh finalmentez there you are 
 
 remembering his manners to the woman apparently accompanying him 
 er scusatmitanto 
 
 turning immediately back to ann

 ann takes his hand and they go out on the floor to dance joe watches them dancing for a moment then takes out a notebook quickly writing something down irving arrives at the bottom of the steps saying something in italian and holding up his camera as he walks past he walks towards the barges the secret service man watches ann as she dances with mario 
 
 irving

 irving 
 musing as he watches them 
 the princess and the barber 
 
 mario and ann continue dancing having a great time 
 irving walks around the other side of the bar his camera placed on the table joe hiding it from the view of the floor the barman protests but irving reassures him keeping his eyes on ann irving watches waiting and then with a signal joe jumps away and the bulb flashes as irving takes the picture in an instant joe jumps back nonchalantly looking up at the sky while irving takes his glass doing the same 
 ann looks out across the floor and then seeing joe and irving waves irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement 
 on the bridge up above the dancing several cars pull up several men climb out rushing over to the steps the first secret service man smoking a cigarette watches the men approach the men walk over to the tables 
 ann continues dancing with mario who suddenly stops looking at her hair 
 
 ann 
 what is it 
 
 mario delani 
 moment 
 
 he stops thinking and then taking out a comb brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts he puts his comb away satisfied ann moves to touch her hair but mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing 
 one of the secret service men stands leaning against a structure swinging his hand to the beat smiling the man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down putting his hands in his pockets looking out again over the dancing 
 the music stops and everyone applauds the musicians

 thank you 
 
 the first secret service man comes over to ann then mario seeing him says something to ann in italian then bye and leaves her to him 
 ann smiles slightly but nervously to the man and they start to dance they turn several times then the man speaks in her ear 
 
 secret service man

 she looks at up him sharply and tries to pull away but he holds her 
 dance quietly towards the entrance there is a car waiting 
 
 ann 
 desperately trying to pull away 
 no 
 
 secret service man

 ann 
 as he forces her over to the side 
 you made a mistake 
 
 tells him in italian pretending that she speak english 
 let me go 
 
 loudly 
 will you let me go 
 
 shouting 
 mr bradley 
 
 joe looks up and starts toward her looking for her in the dancers 
 let me go will you mr bradley 
 irving looks around from his drink and seeing the problem rushes after joe two of the secret service men drag ann away from the barges but joe catches them and pushes them away pushing one of them down and taking ann by the arm joe punches one man who tries to pull ann the other way but the other one manages to push irving over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water joe and ann run to the other side of the floor where the dancers have dispersed and are watching the action 
 joe sees more secret service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way cornered he confronts them as they close ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men having his beard pulled but responds to this with an angry punch to the face mario runs over his hair with his comb muttering some italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help joe the conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune the scene of chaos continues joe and irving and mario laying into the secret service men distracted two of the men manage to grab ann and drag her away joe runs after irving following with his camera 
 joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch freeing ann ann looks around her for a way to help picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at man joe keeps fighting with the man as ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him on a chair one of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head then swings it down hitting him full on the head stunning him for a moment 
 
 irving 
 excitedly trying to get his camera ready having missed the shot the first time 
 hit him again smithy 
 the drummer rolls again as ann swings the guitar back then releasing it and smashing it over the camera flashing as she does so 
 police sirens sound and the polizia arrive packed into their cars as they spill out joe ann and irving start to leave the scene leaving the secret service men staggering or lying about the dance floor dazed 
 
 irving 
 joe give me my car keys 
 
 joe 
 to irving he stops pointing at the police 
 police police 
 
 irving 
 seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction 
 the other side of the bridge 
 as joe and ann run across the barges irving tries stalling the men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him running to follow ann joe and ann run through a boathouse and on reaching the other end walk along the outside edge just above the water 
 unseen a secret service man covers the outside of the boathouse as they double back joe peers round the corner and the man surprises him with a punch to the face knocking him into the water ann knees him in the groin and pushes him away she holds her nose and dives in after joe just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to stop her the polizia arrest the remaining secret service men and take them away one of them being dragged by a guitar around his neck his head clean through the guitar the band starts up again and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across the water apparently after joe and ann as they swim away 
 joe and ann stagger out of the water completely wet through joe leads her to a rock where they sit down joe rubbing her around the shoulders as she shivers 
 
 joe 
 alright 
 
 ann 
 fine how are you 
 
 joe 
 oh fine 
 
 they laugh out loud for several moments he looks at her 
 say you know you were great back there 
 
 ann

 she stops suddenly looking into his eyes he leans forward and kisses long steady kiss they look at each other for a moment 
 
 joe 
 after a pause

 water dripping slowly from the kitchen faucet 
 angle on lester in profile he puts the photograph down props his elbows on the snack bar clasps his hands together and rests his chin on them thinking this almost gives him the appearance of praying and he suddenly appears older more mature and then he smiles the deep satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago 
 after a beat the barrel of a gun rises up behind his head 
 angle on an arrangement of roses in a vase on theopposite counter deep crimson against the white tile wall from the tv in the next room we still hear canned laughter then a gunshot suddenly rings out echoing unnaturally instantly the tile is sprayed with blood the same deep crimson as the roses the canned laughter continues and then the sound fades as everything starts to brighten and the screen goes white 
 we hear a rush of wind 
 fade in

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the very secret diarycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks there was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their christmas holidays because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked so many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that madam pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around bed to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face 
 
 harry and ron went to visit her every evening when the new term started they brought her each homework 
 
 if sprouted whiskers take a break from work said ron tipping a stack of books onto bedside table one evening 
 
 be silly ron got to keep up said hermione briskly her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown i suppose got any new leads she added in a whisper so that madam pomfrey hear her 
 
 nothing said harry gloomily 
 
 i was so sure it was malfoy said ron for about the hundredth time 
 
 that asked harry pointing to something gold sticking out from under pillow 
 
 just a get well card said hermione hastily trying to poke it out of sight but ron was too quick for her he pulled it out flicked it open and read aloud 
 
 to miss granger wishing you a speedy recovery from your concerned teacher professor gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award 
 
 ron looked up at hermione disgusted 
 
 you sleep with this under your pillow 
 
 but hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine 
 
 is lockhart the smarmiest bloke ever met or what ron said to harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward gryffindor tower 
 
 snape had given them so much homework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hair raising potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears 
 
 filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused out of sight listening hard 
 
 you think someone been attacked said ron tensely 
 
 they stood still their heads inclined toward voice which sounded quite hysterical 
 
 even more work for me mopping all night like i got enough to do no this is the final straw going to dumbledore 
 
 his footsteps receded along the corridor and they heard a distant door slam 
 
 they poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spot where mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance what filch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched over half the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of moaning bathroom now that filch had stopped shouting they could hear wails echoing off the bathroom walls 
 
 now up with her said ron 
 
 go and see said harry and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and entered 
 
 moaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than ever before she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet 
 
 up myrtle said harry 
 
 that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw something else at me 
 
 harry waded across to her stall and said why would i throw something at you 
 
 ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet more water which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i am minding my own business and someone thinks funny to throw a book at me 
 
 but it hurt you if someone throws something at you said harry reasonably i mean just go right through you it 
 
 he had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked all throw books at myrtle because she feel it ten points if you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes through her head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i think 
 
 who threw it at you anyway asked harry 
 
 i know i was just sitting in the thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtle glaring at them over there it got washed out 
 
 harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing a small thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward to pick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back 
 
 what said harry 
 
 are you crazy said ron it could be dangerous 
 
 harry laughing come off it how could it be dangerous 
 
 be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively at the book some of the books the confiscated told me there was one that burned your eyes out and everyone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you could never stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything and 
 
 all right got the point said harry 
 
 the little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggy 
 
 well we find out unless we look at it he said and he ducked around ron and picked it up off the floor 
 
 harry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first page he could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged ink 
 
 hang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was looking over shoulder i know that name t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago 
 
 how on earth know that said harry in amazement 
 
 because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs all over if wiped slime off a name for an hour remember it too 
 
 harry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blank there the faintest trace of writing on any of them not even auntie birthday or dentist three 
 
 he never wrote in it said harry disappointed 
 
 i wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiously 
 
 harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on vauxhall road london 
 
 he been said harry thoughtfully to have bought a diary from vauxhall road 
 
 well not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fifty points if you can get it through nose 
 
 harry however pocketed it 
 
 hermione left the hospital wing and furfree at the beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindor tower harry showed her t m diary and told her the story of how they had found it 
 
 oooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiastically taking the diary and looking at it closely 
 
 if it has hiding them very well said ron maybe shy i know why you chuck it harry 
 
 i wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry i mind knowing how riddle got an award for special services to hogwarts either 
 
 been anything said ron maybe he got thirty or saved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that done everyone a favor 
 
 but harry could tell from the arrested look on face that she was thinking what he was thinking 
 
 what said ron looking from one to the other 
 
 well the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago it he said what malfoy said 
 
 yeah said ron slowly 
 
 and this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedly 
 
 so 
 
 oh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person who opened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we know t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir of slytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where the chamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person behind the attacks this time want that lying around would they 
 
 a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny little flaw nothing written in his diary 
 
 but hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag 
 
 it might be invisible ink she whispered 
 
 she tapped the diary three times and said aparecium 
 
 nothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser 
 
 a revealer i got it in diagon alley she said 
 
 she rubbed hard on january first nothing happened 
 
 telling you nothing to find in there said ron riddle just got a diary for christmas and be bothered filling it in 
 
 harry explain even to himself why he just throw diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages as though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry was sure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemed to mean something to him almost as though riddle was a friend had when he was very small and had but this was absurd never had friends before hogwarts dudley had made sure of that 
 
 nevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle so next day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine special award accompanied by an interested hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced ron who told them seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime 
 
 burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet it carry details of why it had been given to him good thing too or be even bigger and still be polishing it said ron however they did find name on an old medal for magical merit and on a list of old head boys 
 
 he sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgust prefect head boy probably top of every class 
 
 you say that like a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurt voice 
 
 the sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again inside the castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been no more attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick and madam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leaving childhood 
 
 the moment their acne clears up be ready for repotting again harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that it be long until cutting them up and stewing them have mrs norris back in no time 
 
 perhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harry it must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secrets with the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monster whatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years 
 
 ernie macmillan of hufflepuff take this cheerful view he was still convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had given himself away at the dueling club peeves helping matters he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter you rotter now with a dance routine to match 
 
 gilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while the gryffindors were lining up for transfiguration i think be any more trouble minerva he said tapping his nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been locked for good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before i came down hard on him 
 
 you know what the school needs now is a wash away the memories of last term i say any more just now but i think i know just the thing 
 
 he tapped his nose again and strode off 
 
 idea of a became clear at breakfast time on february fourteenth harry had much sleep because of a quidditch practice the night before and he hurried down to the great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that walked through the wrong doors 
 
 the walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worse still confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harry went over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting looking sickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles 
 
 going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon 
 
 ron pointed to the apparently too disgusted to speak lockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations was waving for silence the teachers on either side of him were looking from where he sat harry could see a muscle going in professor cheek snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of 
 
 happy day lockhart shouted and may i thank the people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it end here 
 
 lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen dwarfs not just any dwarfs however lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps 
 
 my friendly cupids beamed lockhart they will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fun stop here sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you how to whip up a love potion and while at it professor flitwick knows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard ever met the sly old dog 
 
 professor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would be poison 
 
 please hermione tell me you one of the said ron as they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and answer 
 
 all day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon as the gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfs caught up with harry 
 
 oy you arry potter shouted a particularly dwarf elbowing people out of the way to get to harry 
 
 hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry tried to escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd by kicking shins and reached him before gone two paces 
 
 got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person he said twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way 
 
 not here harry hissed trying to escape 
 
 stay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of bag and pulling him back 
 
 let me go harry snarled tugging 
 
 with a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wand parchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything 
 
 harry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing causing something of a holdup in the corridor 
 
 going on here came the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musical valentine 
 
 all this commotion said another familiar voice as percy weasley arrived 
 
 losing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor 
 
 right he said sitting on ankles here is your singing valentine 
 
 his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad 
 
 his hair is as dark as a blackboard 
 
 i wish he was mine 
 
 really divine 
 
 the hero who conquered the dark lord 
 
 harry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on the spot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did his best to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirth 
 
 off you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to class now he said shooing some of the younger students away and you malfoy 
 
 harry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up something leering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized that got diary 
 
 give that back said harry quietly 
 
 wonder what written in this said malfoy who obviously noticed the year on the cover and thought he had own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staring from the diary to harry looking terrified 
 
 hand it over malfoy said percy sternly 
 
 when had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly at harry 
 
 percy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper he pulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just as snape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught it 
 
 harry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors have to report this you know 
 
 but harry care he was on malfoy and that was worth five points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious and as ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully after her i think potter liked your valentine much 
 
 ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarling ron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron need to spend the whole of charms belching slugs 
 
 it until they had reached professor class that harry noticed something rather odd about diary all his other books were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it he tried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with his wand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end and he much interested in anything else 
 
 harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night this was partly because he think he could stand fred and george singing his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time and partly because he wanted to examine diary again and knew that ron thought he was wasting his time 
 
 harry sat on his and flicked through the blank pages not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary 
 
 the ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though it was being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potter 
 
 the words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank without trace then at last something happened 
 
 oozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harry had never written 
 
 hello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by my diary 
 
 these words too faded away but not before harry had started to scribble back 
 
 someone tried to flush it down a toilet 
 
 he waited eagerly for reply 
 
 lucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink but i always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read 
 
 what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in his excitement 
 
 i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that were covered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 where i am now harry wrote quickly at hogwarts and horrible been happening do you know anything about the chamber of secrets 
 
 his heart was hammering reply came quickly his writing becoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew 
 
 of course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us it was a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year the chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finally killing one i caught the person opened the chamber and he was expelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thing had happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shiny engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but i knew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned 
 
 harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back 
 
 happening again now there have been three attacks and no one seems to know behind them who was it last time 
 
 i can show you if you like came reply you have to take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the night when i caught him 
 
 harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddle mean how could he be taken inside somebody memory he glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which was growing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh words forming 
 
 let me show you 
 
 harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters 
 
 ok 
 
 the pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind stopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging open harry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightly he raised the book to press his eye against the little window and before he knew what was happening he was tilting forward the window was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of color and shadow 
 
 he felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus 
 
 he knew immediately where he was this circular room with the sleeping portraits was office but it dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk a wizened wizard bald except for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter by candlelight harry had never seen this man before 
 
 sorry he said shakily i mean to butt in 
 
 but the wizard look up he continued to read frowning slightly harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er just go shall i 
 
 still the wizard ignored him he seem even to have heard him thinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voice 
 
 sorry i disturbed you go now he 
 
 the wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked past harry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at his window 
 
 the sky outside the window was it seemed to be sunset the wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbs watching the door 
 
 harry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirring silver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known it meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledore and he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago 
 
 there was a knock on the office door 
 
 enter said the old wizard in a feeble voice 
 
 a boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silver badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller than harry but he too had hair 
 
 ah riddle said the headmaster 
 
 you wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he looked nervous 
 
 sit down said dippet just been reading the letter you sent me 
 
 oh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together very tightly 
 
 my dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer surely you want to go home for the holidays 
 
 no said riddle at once much rather stay at hogwarts than go back to that to that 
 
 you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe said dippet curiously 
 
 yes sir said riddle reddening slightly 
 
 you are 
 
 sir said riddle muggle father witch mother 
 
 and are both your parents 
 
 my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after my father marvolo after my grandfather 
 
 dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically 
 
 the thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might have been made for you but in the current circumstances 
 
 you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and heart leapt and he moved closer scared of missing anything 
 
 precisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death of that poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage as a matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking about closing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of all this unpleasantness 
 
 eyes had widened 
 
 sir if the person was caught if it all stopped 
 
 what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sitting up in his chair riddle do you mean you know something about these attacks 
 
 no sir said riddle quickly 
 
 but harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given dumbledore 
 
 dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed 
 
 you may go tom 
 
 riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harry followed him 
 
 down the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so did harry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing some serious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowed 
 
 then as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried off harry gliding noiselessly behind him they see another person until they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with long sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marble staircase 
 
 what are you doing wandering around this late tom 
 
 harry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a dumbledore 
 
 i had to see the headmaster sir said riddle 
 
 well hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam the corridors these days not since 
 
 he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddle watched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hot pursuit 
 
 but to disappointment riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which harry had potions with snape the torches been lit and when riddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only just see him standing by the door watching the passage outside 
 
 it felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he could see was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crack waiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present he heard something move beyond the door 
 
 someone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as a shadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behind him forgetting that he be heard 
 
 for perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddle stopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noises harry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper 
 
 gotta get yeh outta here now in the box 
 
 there was something familiar about that voice 
 
 riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behind him he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door a very large box next to it 
 
 evening rubeus said riddle sharply 
 
 the boy slammed the door shut and stood up 
 
 what yer here tom 
 
 riddle stepped closer 
 
 all over he said going to have to turn you in rubeus talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks stop 
 
 n at 
 
 i think you meant to kill anyone but monsters make good pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and 
 
 it never killed no one said the large boy backing against the closed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking 
 
 come on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead parents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered 
 
 it him roared the boy his voice echoing in the dark passage he wouldn he never 
 
 stand aside said riddle drawing out his wand 
 
 his spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite and out of it came something that made harry let out a long piercing scream unheard by anyone 
 
 a vast hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam of many eyes and a pair of pincers riddle raised his wand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as it scuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddle scrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but the huge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back down yelling noooooo 
 
 the scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himself falling and with a crash he landed on his in the gryffindor dormitory diary lying open on his stomach 
 
 before he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory door opened and ron came in 
 
 there you are he said 
 
 harry sat up he was sweating and shaking 
 
 up said ron looking at him with concern 
 
 it was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fifty years ago 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen gryffindor versus ravenclawcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 it looked like the end of ron and friendship each was so angry with the other that harry see how ever make up 
 
 ron was enraged that hermione had never taken attempts to eat scabbers seriously bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys beds hermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on head in the magical menagerie 
 
 personally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry too 
 
 okay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers my fault it just leave me alone harry got a lot of work to do 
 
 ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed 
 
 come on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and been for ages he was wasting away it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly one swallow he probably feel a thing 
 
 fred said ginny indignantly 
 
 all he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said george 
 
 he bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harry 
 
 yeah true said harry 
 
 his finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory oh come on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat the point of moaning 
 
 in a attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after finished this did seem to take mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off for the quidditch field together 
 
 madam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion 
 
 look at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault a slight list to the tail end you often find they develop a drag after a few years updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows a pity stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was too 
 
 she continued in this vein for some time until wood said er madam hooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need to practice 
 
 oh right here you are then potter said madam hooch sit over here with weasley 
 
 she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for match 
 
 harry just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker cho chang a fourth year and pretty goodi really hoped she be fit had some problems with injuries wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone go 
 
 and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the ground 
 
 it was better than ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air again 
 
 harry letting the snitch out wood called 
 
 harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand 
 
 the team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others he spotted it lurking near katie knee looped her easily and caught it again 
 
 it was the best practice ever the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a first 
 
 i see going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless harry sorted out your dementor problem you 
 
 yeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were stronger 
 
 the dementors turn up again oliver go ballistic said fred confidently 
 
 well hope not said wood anyway good work everyone get back to the towerturn in early 
 
 staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms harry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat 
 
 here you go said harry handing ron the firebolt 
 
 ron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castle 
 
 harry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darkness 
 
 harry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribs 
 
 the matter said ron 
 
 harry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumos 
 
 a beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanks 
 
 get out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail 
 
 see ron said furiously chucking the stone down again still letting him wander about wherever he wants probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds now 
 
 harry say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry say anything to ron nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hall 
 
 
 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck 
 
 did you see his face said ron gleefully looking back at malfoy he believe it this is brilliant 
 
 wood too was basking in the reflected glory of the firebolt 
 
 put it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look cedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and ravenclaw girlfriend penelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the firebolt 
 
 now now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the team ten galleons on the outcome of the match 
 
 penelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her table 
 
 harry make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i got ten galleons yes coming penny and he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast 
 
 sure you can manage that broom potter said a cold drawling voice 
 
 draco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and goyle right behind him 
 
 yeah reckon so said harry casually 
 
 got plenty of special features it said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it come with a parachute in case you get too near a dementor 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 pity you attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for you 
 
 the gryffindor team laughed loudly pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin team who put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether broom really was a firebolt 
 
 at a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watching 
 
 you know what got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match out of the running just just fly like you did in practice yesterday and be okay 
 
 they walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the field their seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry help noticing nervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he think had anything to do with nerves 
 
 wood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shook hands with the ravenclaw captain 
 
 mount your brooms on my whistle three two one 
 
 harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordan 
 
 off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstick the going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this world championship 
 
 jordan would you mind telling us going on in the match interrupted professor voice 
 
 right you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a and 
 
 jordan 
 
 okay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goal 
 
 harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across him forcing him to change direction 
 
 show her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia 
 
 harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriers 
 
 harry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry was speeding up excitement flooding him dives were his specialty he was ten feet away 
 
 then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished 
 
 there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it 
 
 gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go really putting it through its paces now see it turn comet is just no match for it the precision balance is really noticeable in these long 
 
 jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentary 
 
 ravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before him ravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post 
 
 harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him 
 
 harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have to 
 
 harry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herselfall right thenif she wanted to tail him have to take the consequences 
 
 he dived again and cho thinking seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end 
 
 he accelerated so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then 
 
 oh screamed cho pointing 
 
 distracted harry looked down 
 
 three dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at him 
 
 he stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronum 
 
 something something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitch 
 
 madam whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd 
 
 my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd 
 
 yes ron yelled yanking arm into the air yes yes 
 
 well done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me 
 
 good for you harry roared seamus finnigan 
 
 ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindors 
 
 that was quite some patronus said a voice in ear 
 
 harry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleased 
 
 the dementors affect me at all harry said excitedly i feel a thing 
 
 that would be because they er dementors said professor lupin come and see 
 
 he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field 
 
 you gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupin 
 
 harry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy crabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagall 
 
 an unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes now 
 
 if anything could have set the seal on victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe head still stuck inside it 
 
 come on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room now 
 
 right said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle 
 
 
 
 it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweets 
 
 how did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowd 
 
 with a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in ear 
 
 only one person joining in the festivities hermione incredibly was sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her 
 
 did you even come to the match he asked her 
 
 of course i did said hermione in a strangely voice not looking up and very glad we won and i think you did really well but i need to read this by monday 
 
 come on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet 
 
 i harry still got four hundred and pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he want me to join in 
 
 there was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudly if scabbers just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them 
 
 hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sight 
 
 you give her a break harry asked ron quietly 
 
 no said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but never admit wrong hermione still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or something 
 
 the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep 
 
 he had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a run and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat out and ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and 
 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggghhhhhhh nooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 
 harry woke as suddenly as though been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus voice from the other side of the room 
 
 going on 
 
 harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same moment dean thomas lit his lamp 
 
 ron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face 
 
 black sirius black with a knife 
 
 what 
 
 here just now slashed the curtains woke me up 
 
 you sure you dreaming ron said dean 
 
 look at the curtains i tell you he was here 
 
 they all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door first and they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after them 
 
 who shouted 
 
 you doing 
 
 the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was deserted 
 
 are you sure you dreaming ron 
 
 telling you i saw him 
 
 all the noise 
 
 professor mcgonagall told us to go to bed 
 
 a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling on dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearing 
 
 excellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightly 
 
 everyone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke 
 
 perce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me up 
 
 the common room went very still 
 
 nonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare 
 
 telling you 
 
 now really enough 
 
 professor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around 
 
 i am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of you 
 
 i certainly authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all t 
 
 o get back to bed my brother ron here had a nightmare 
 
 it a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knife 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared at him 
 
 be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole 
 
 ask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir picture ask him if he saw 
 
 glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor tower 
 
 certainly good lady cried sir cadogan 
 
 there was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common room 
 
 you you did said professor mcgonagall but but the password 
 
 he had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole my lady read em off a little piece of paper 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalk 
 
 which person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this passwords and left them lying around 
 
 there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks neville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the air 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen moodycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the storm had blown itself out by the following morning though the ceiling in the great hall was still gloomy heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as harry ron and hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast a few seats along fred george and lee jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the triwizard tournament 
 
 not badoutside all morning said ron who was running his finger down the monday column of his schedule herbology with the hufflepuffs and care of magical creaturesdamn it still with the slytherins 
 
 double divination this afternoon harry groaned looking down divination was his least favorite subject apart from potions professor trelawney kept predicting death which he found extremely annoying 
 
 you should have given it up like me you said hermione briskly buttering herself some toast then be doing something sensible like arithmancy 
 
 eating again i notice said ron watching hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too 
 
 decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights said hermione haughtily 
 
 yeahand you were hungry said ron grinning 
 
 there was a sudden rustling noise above them and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail instinctively harry looked up but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray the owls circled the tables looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap neville almost always forgot to pack something on the other side of the hall draco eagle owl had landed on his shoulder carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach harry returned to his porridge was it possible that something had happened to hedwig and that sirius even got his letter 
 
 his preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three but here he was distracted by professor sprout showing the class the ugliest plants harry had ever seen indeed they looked less like plants than thick black giant slugs protruding vertically out of the soil each was squirming slightly and had a number of large shiny swellings upon it which appeared to be full of liquid 
 
 bubotubers professor sprout told them briskly they need squeezing you will collect the pus 
 
 the what said seamus finnigan sounding revolted 
 
 pus finnigan pus said professor sprout and extremely valuable so waste it you will collect the pus i say in these bottles wear your gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted bubotuber pus 
 
 squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting but oddly satisfying as each swelling was popped a large amount of thick liquid burst forth which smelled strongly of petrol they caught it in the bottles as professor sprout had indicated and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints 
 
 keep madam pomfrey happy said professor sprout stoppering the last bottle with a cork an excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne bubotuber pus should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples 
 
 like poor eloise midgen said hannah abbott a hufflepuff in a hushed voice she tried to curse hers off 
 
 silly girl said professor sprout shaking her head but madam pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end 
 
 a booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds signaling the end of the lesson and the class separated the hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for transfiguration and the gryffindors heading in the other direction down the sloping lawn toward small wooden cabin which stood on the edge of the forbidden forest 
 
 hagrid was standing outside his hut one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound fang there were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet and fang was whimpering and straining at his collar apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely as they drew nearer an odd rattling noise reached their ears punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions 
 
 mornin hagrid said grinning at harry ron and hermione wait fer the slytherins they won want ter miss this skrewts 
 
 come again said ron 
 
 hagrid pointed down into the crates 
 
 eurgh squealed lavender brown jumping backward 
 
 eurgh just about summed up the skrewts in opinion they looked like deformed lobsters horribly pale and with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads there were about a hundred of them in each crate each about six inches long crawling over one another bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes they were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish every now and then sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt and with a small phut it would be propelled forward several inches 
 
 jus hatched said hagrid proudly so be able ter raise em yerselves thought make a bit of a project of it 
 
 and why would we want to raise them said a cold voice 
 
 the slytherins had arrived the speaker was draco malfoy crabbe and goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words 
 
 hagrid looked stumped at the question 
 
 i mean what do they do asked malfoy what is the point of them 
 
 hagrid opened his mouth apparently thinking hard there was a few seconds pause then he said roughly next lesson malfoy yer jus feedin em today now wan ter try em on a few things never had em before not sure what go fer i got ant eggs an frog livers an a bit o grass snake just try em out with a bit of each 
 
 first pus and now this muttered seamus 
 
 nothing but deep affection for hagrid could have made harry ron and hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the skrewts harry suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless because the skrewts seem to have mouths 
 
 ouch yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes it got me 
 
 hagrid hurried over to him looking anxious 
 
 its end exploded said dean angrily showing hagrid a burn on his hand 
 
 ah yeah that can happen when they blast off said hagrid nodding 
 
 eurgh said lavender brown again eurgh hagrid that pointy thing on it 
 
 ah some of em have got stings said hagrid enthusiastically lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box i reckon the got sorta sucker things on their think they might be ter suck blood 
 
 well i can certainly see why trying to keep them alive said malfoy sarcastically who want pets that can burn sting and bite all at once 
 
 just because not very pretty it mean not useful hermione snapped dragon amazingly magical but you want a dragon for a pet would you 
 
 harry and ron grinned at hagrid who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon as harry ron and hermione knew only too well he had owned one for a brief period during their first year a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures the more lethal the better 
 
 well at least the skrewts are small said ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later 
 
 they are now said hermione in an exasperated voice but once found out what they eat i expect be six feet long 
 
 well that matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something will it said ron grinning slyly at her 
 
 you know perfectly well i only said that to shut malfoy up said hermione as a matter of fact i think right the best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all 
 
 they sat down at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes hermione began to eat so fast that harry and ron stared at her 
 
 er is this the new stand on elf rights said ron going to make yourself puke instead 
 
 no said hermione with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts i just want to get to the library 
 
 what said ron in disbelief hermione the first day back we even got homework yet 
 
 hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days then she leapt to her feet said see you at dinner and departed at high speed 
 
 when the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons harry and ron set off for north tower where at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling and the room where professor trelawney lived 
 
 the familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder as ever the curtains were all closed the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps which were all draped with scarves and shawls harry and ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room and sat down at the same small circular table 
 
 good day said the misty voice of professor trelawney right behind harry making him jump 
 
 a very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face professor trelawney was peering down at harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him the usual large amount of beads chains and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight 
 
 you are preoccupied my dear she said mournfully to harry my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless i see difficult times ahead for you alasmost difficulti fear the thing you dread will indeed come to perhaps sooner than you think 
 
 her voice dropped almost to a whisper ron rolled his eyes at harry who looked stonily back professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire facing the class lavender brown and parvati patil who deeply admired professor trelawney were sitting on poufs very close to her 
 
 my dears it is time for us to consider the stars she said the movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays which intermingle 
 
 but thoughts had drifted the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and and professor rambling talks on never held him exactly spellbound though he help thinking about what she had just said to him i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass 
 
 but hermione was right harry thought irritably professor trelawney really was an old fraud he dreading anything at the moment at allwell unless you counted his fears that sirius had been caughtbut what did professor trelawney know he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner 
 
 except of course for that time at the end of last term when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising againand dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine when harry had described it to him 
 
 harry ron muttered 
 
 what 
 
 harry looked around the whole class was staring at him he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off lost in the heat and his thoughts 
 
 i was saying my dear that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of saturn said professor trelawney a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words 
 
 born under what sorry said harry 
 
 saturn dear the planet saturn said professor trelawney sounding definitely irritated that he riveted by this news i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your dark hairyour mean staturetragic losses so young in lifei think i am right in saying my dear that you were born in midwinter 
 
 no said harry i was born in july 
 
 ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough 
 
 half an hour later each of them had been given a complicated circular chart and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth it was dull work requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles 
 
 got two neptunes here said harry after a while frowning down at his piece of parchment that be right can it 
 
 aaaaah said ron imitating professor mystical whisper when two neptunes appear in the sky it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born harry 
 
 seamus and dean who were working nearby sniggered loudly though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown oh professor look i think got an unaspected planet oooh which that professor 
 
 it is uranus my dear said professor trelawney peering down at the chart 
 
 can i have a look at uranus too lavender said ron 
 
 most unfortunately professor trelawney heard him and it was this perhaps that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class 
 
 a detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you with reference to your personal chart she snapped sounding much more like professor mcgonagall than her usual self i want it ready to hand in next monday and no excuses 
 
 miserable old bat said ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the great hall and dinner take all weekend that will 
 
 lots of homework said hermione brightly catching up with them professor vector give us any at all 
 
 well bully for professor vector said ron moodily 
 
 they reached the entrance hall which was packed with people queuing for dinner they had just joined the end of the line when a loud voice rang out behind them 
 
 weasley hey weasley 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing there each looking thoroughly pleased about something 
 
 what said ron shortly 
 
 your in the paper weasley said malfoy brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear listen to this 
 
 further mistakes at the ministry of magic 
 it seems as though the ministry of troubles are not yet at an end writes rita skeeter special correspondent recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the quidditch world cup and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley of the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 malfoy looked up 
 
 imagine them not even getting his name right weasley almost as though a complete nonentity it he crowed 
 
 everyone in the entrance hall was listening now malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on 
 
 arnold weasley who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins mr weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of moody the aged who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder unsurprisingly mr weasley found upon arrival at mr heavily guarded house that mr moody had once again raised a false alarm mr weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene 
 and a picture weasley said malfoy flipping the paper over and holding it up a picture of your parents outside their house if you can call it a house your mother could do with losing a bit of weight she 
 
 ron was shaking with fury everyone was staring at him 
 
 get stuffed malfoy said harry ron 
 
 oh yeah you were staying with them this summer you potter sneered malfoy so tell me is his mother really that porky or is it just the picture 
 
 you know your mother malfoy said harry both he and hermione had grabbed the back of robes to stop him from launching himself at malfoy that expression got like got dung under her nose has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with her 
 
 pale face went slightly pink 
 
 you dare insult my mother potter 
 
 keep your fat mouth shut then said harry turning away 
 
 bang 
 
 several people screamed harry felt something graze the side of his face he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand but before even touched it he heard a second loud bang and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall 
 
 oh no you laddie 
 
 harry spun around professor moody was limping down the marble staircase his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret which was shivering on the floor exactly where malfoy had been standing 
 
 there was a terrified silence in the entrance hall nobody but moody was moving a muscle moody turned to look at harry at least his normal eye was looking at harry the other one was pointing into the back of his head 
 
 did he get you moody growled his voice was low and gravelly 
 
 no said harry missed 
 
 leave it moody shouted 
 
 leave what harry said bewildered 
 
 not you him moody growled jerking his thumb over his shoulder at crabbe who had just frozen about to pick up the white ferret it seemed that rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head 
 
 moody started to limp toward crabbe goyle and the ferret which gave a terrified squeak and took off streaking toward the dungeons 
 
 i think so roared moody pointing his wand at the ferret again it flew ten feet into the air fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once more 
 
 i like people who attack when their turned growled moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher squealing in pain stinking cowardly scummy thing to do 
 
 the ferret flew through the air its legs and tail flailing helplessly 
 
 never do that again said moody speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again 
 
 professor moody said a shocked voice 
 
 professor mcgonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books 
 
 hello professor mcgonagall said moody calmly bouncing the ferret still higher 
 
 what what are you doing said professor mcgonagall her eyes following the bouncing progress through the air 
 
 teaching said moody 
 
 teach moody is that a student shrieked professor mcgonagall the books spilling out of her arms 
 
 yep said moody 
 
 no cried professor mcgonagall running down the stairs and pulling out her wand a moment later with a loud snapping noise draco malfoy had reappeared lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face he got to his feet wincing 
 
 moody we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor mcgonagall wealdy surely professor dumbledore told you that 
 
 he mentioned it yeah said moody scratching his chin unconcernedly but i thought a good sharp shock 
 
 we give detentions moody or speak to the head of house 
 
 do that then said moody staring at malfoy with great dislike 
 
 malfoy whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation looked malevolently up at moody and muttered something in which the words my father were distinguishable 
 
 oh yeah said moody quietly limping forward a few steps the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall well i know your father of old tell him keeping a close eye on his sonyou tell him that from your head of be snape will it 
 
 yes said malfoy resentfully 
 
 another old friend growled moody been looking forward to a chat with old on you 
 
 and he seized upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments then waved her wand at her fallen books causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms 
 
 talk to me ron said quietly to harry and hermione as they sat down at the gryffindor table a few minutes later surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened 
 
 why not said hermione in surprise 
 
 because i want to fix that in my memory forever said ron his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face draco malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret 
 
 harry and hermione both laughed and hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates 
 
 he could have really hurt malfoy though she said it was good really that professor mcgonagall stopped it 
 
 hermione said ron furiously his eyes snapping open again ruining the best moment of my life 
 
 hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again 
 
 tell me going back to the library this evening said harry watching her 
 
 got to said hermione thickly loads to do 
 
 but you told us professor vector 
 
 not schoolwork she said within five minutes she had cleared her plate and departed no sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by fred weasley 
 
 moody he said how cool is he 
 
 beyond cool said george sitting down opposite fred 
 
 supercool said the twins best friend lee jordan sliding into the seat beside george we had him this afternoon he told harry and ron 
 
 what was it like said harry eagerly 
 
 fred george and lee exchanged looks full of meaning 
 
 never had a lesson like it said fred 
 
 he knows man said lee 
 
 knows what said ron leaning forward 
 
 knows what like to be out there doing it said george impressively 
 
 doing what said harry 
 
 fighting the dark arts said fred 
 
 seen it all said george 
 
 mazing said lee 
 
 ron dived into his bag for his schedule 
 
 we got him till thursday he said in a disappointed voice 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen dentention with delorescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dinner in the great hall that night was not a pleasant experience for harry the news about his shouting match with umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by hogwarts standards he heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between ron and hermione the funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him on the contrary it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again so that they could hear his story 
 
 he says he saw cedric diggory murdered 
 
 he reckons he duelled with 
 
 come off it 
 
 who does he think kidding 
 
 
 
 what i get said harry through clenched teeth laying down his knife and fork his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two months ago when dumbledore told them 
 
 the thing is harry not sure they did said hermione grimly oh get out of here 
 
 she slammed down her own knife and fork ron looked longingly at his apple pie but followed suit people stared at them all the way out of the hall 
 
 what mean not sure they believed dumbledore harry asked hermione when they reached the landing 
 
 look you understand what it was like after it happened said hermione quietly you arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching dead body none of us saw what what happened in the maze we just had word for it that had come back and killed cedric and fought you 
 
 which is the truth said harry loudly 
 
 i know it is harry so will you please stop biting my head off said hermione wearily just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two months reading about how a nutcase and going senile 
 
 rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to gryffindor tower harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed a dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye he glanced out of a window at the dark grounds as they turned into the fat corridor there was still no light in cabin 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said hermione before the fat lady could ask the portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it 
 
 the common room was almost empty nearly everyone was still down at dinner crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when harry ron and hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion harry gazed into the flames feeling drained and exhausted 
 
 how can dumbledore have let this happen hermione cried suddenly making harry and ron jump crookshanks leapt off her looking affronted she pounded the arms of her chair in fury so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes how can he let that terrible woman teach us and in our owl year too 
 
 well never had great defence against the dark arts teachers have we said harry you know what like hagrid told us nobody wants the job they say jinxed 
 
 yes but to employ someone actually refusing to let us do magic dumbledore playing at 
 
 and trying to get people to spy for her said ron darkly 
 
 remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying back 
 
 of course here to spy on us all obvious why else would fudge have wanted her to come snapped hermione 
 
 start arguing again said harry wearily as ron opened his mouth to retaliate we just just do that homework get it out of the way 
 
 they collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire people were coming back from dinner now harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stares he was attracting 
 
 shall we do stuff first said ron dipping his quill into his ink the properties of moonstone and its uses in he muttered writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them there he underlined the title then looked up expectantly at hermione 
 
 so what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in 
 
 but hermione was not listening she was squinting over into the far corner of the room where fred george and lee jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that fred was holding 
 
 no sorry gone too far she said standing up and looking positively furious come on ron 
 
 i what said ron plainly playing for time nocome on hermionewe tell them off for giving out sweets 
 
 you know perfectly well that those are bits of nosebleed nougat oror puking pastilles or 
 
 fainting fancies harry suggested quietly 
 
 one by one as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet the were slumping unconscious in their seats some slid right on to the floor others merely hung over the arms of their chairs their tongues lolling out most of the people watching were laughing hermione however squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where fred and george now stood with clipboards closely observing the unconscious ron rose halfway out of his chair hovered uncertainly for a moment or two then muttered to harry got it under control before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted 
 
 enough hermione said forcefully to fred and george both of whom looked up in mild surprise 
 
 yeah right said george nodding this dosage looks strong enough it 
 
 i told you this morning you test your rubbish on students 
 
 paying them said fred indignantly 
 
 i care it could be dangerous 
 
 rubbish said fred 
 
 calm down hermione fine said lee reassuringly as he walked from to inserting purple sweets into their open mouths 
 
 yeah look coming round now said george 
 
 a few of the were indeed stirring several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chairs that harry was sure fred and george had not warned them what the sweets were going to do 
 
 feel all right said george kindly to a small girl lying at his feet 
 
 ii think so she said shakily 
 
 excellent said fred happily but the next second hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of fainting fancies from his hands 
 
 it is not excellent 
 
 course it is alive they said fred angrily 
 
 you do this what if you made one of them really ill 
 
 not going to make them ill already tested them all on ourselves this is just to see if everyone reacts the same 
 
 if you stop doing it going to 
 
 put us in detention said fred in an voice 
 
 make us write lines said george smirking 
 
 onlookers all over the room were laughing hermione drew herself up to her full height her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity 
 
 no she said her voice quivering with anger but i will write to your mother 
 
 you said george horrified taking a step back from her 
 
 oh yes i would said hermione grimly i stop you eating the stupid things yourselves but not to give them to the 
 
 fred and george looked thunderstruck it was clear that as far as they were concerned threat was way below the belt with a last threatening look at them she thrust clipboard and the bag of fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire 
 
 ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees 
 
 thank you for your support ron hermione said acidly 
 
 you handled it fine by yourself ron mumbled 
 
 hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds then said edgily oh no good i concentrate now going to bed 
 
 she wrenched her bag open harry thought she was about to put her books away but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace covered them with a few bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect 
 
 what in the name of merlin are you doing said ron watching her as though fearful for her sanity 
 
 hats for she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag i did them over the summer a really slow knitter without magic but now back at school i should be able to make lots more 
 
 leaving out hats for the said ron slowly and covering them up with rubbish first 
 
 yes said hermione defiantly swinging her bag on to her back 
 
 not on said ron angrily trying to trick them into picking up the hats setting them free when they might not want to be free 
 
 of course they want to be free said hermione at once though her face was turning pink you dare touch those hats ron 
 
 she turned on her heel and left ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls dormitories then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats 
 
 they should at least see what picking up he said firmly anyway he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of essay no point trying to finish this now i do it without hermione i got a clue what supposed to do with moonstones have you 
 
 harry shook his head noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse he thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply knowing perfectly well that when the morning came he would regret not finishing his homework that night he piled his books back into his bag 
 
 going to bed too 
 
 he passed seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories but did not look at him harry had a fleeting impression that seamus had opened his mouth to speak but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation 
 
 the following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast 
 
 but on the plus side no snape today said ron bracingly 
 
 hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee she looked mildly pleased about something and when ron asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hats have gone seems the do want freedom after all 
 
 i bet on it ron told her cuttingly they might not count as clothes they look anything like hats to me more like woolly bladders 
 
 hermione did not speak to him all morning 
 
 double charms was succeeded by double transfiguration professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of owls 
 
 what you must remember said little professor flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come if you have not already given serious thought to your careers now is the time to do so and in the meantime afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice 
 
 they then spent over an hour revising summoning charms which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of charms homework 
 
 it was the same if not worse in transfiguration 
 
 you cannot pass an owl said professor mcgonagall grimly without serious application practice and study i see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an owl in transfiguration as long as they put in the work neville made a sad little disbelieving noise yes you too longbottom said professor mcgonagall nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence so today we are starting vanishing spells these are easier than conjuring spells which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl 
 
 she was quite right harry found the vanishing spells horribly difficult by the end of a double period neither he nor ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising though ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler hermione on the other hand successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt earning her a bonus for gryffindor from professor mcgonagall she was the only person not given homework everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon 
 
 now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do harry and ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in still angry about slur on her woolly hats hermione did not join them by the time they reached care of magical creatures in the afternoon head was aching again 
 
 the day had become cool and breezy and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces professor stood waiting for the class some ten yards from front door a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs as harry and ron reached her a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them turning they saw draco malfoy striding towards them surrounded by his usual gang of slytherin cronies he had clearly just said something highly amusing because crabbe goyle pansy parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and judging by the way they all kept looking over at harry he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty 
 
 everyone here barked professor once all the slytherins and gryffindors had arrived crack on then who can tell me what these things are called 
 
 she indicated the heap of twigs in front of her hand shot into the air behind her back malfoy did a imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question pansy parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny creatures made of wood each with knobbly brown arms and legs two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat barklike face in which a pair of eyes glittered 
 
 oooooh said parvati and lavender thoroughly irritating harry anyone would have thought hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough and the skrewts perhaps too much so 
 
 kindly keep your voices down girls said professor sharply scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the who immediately fell upon the food soanyone know the names of these creatures miss granger 
 
 bowtruckles said hermione usually live in 
 
 five points for gryffindor said professor yes these are bowtruckles and as miss granger rightly says they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality anybody know what they eat 
 
 woodlice said hermione promptly which explained why what harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving but fairy eggs if they can get them 
 
 good girl take another five points so whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it they may not look dangerous but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers which as you can see are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs so if like to gather closer take a few woodlice and a bowtrucklei have enough here for one between threeyou can study them more closely i want a sketch from each of you with all labelled by the end of the lesson 
 
 the class surged forwards around the trestle table harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to professor 
 
 hagrid he asked her while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles 
 
 never you mind said professor repressively which had been her attitude last time hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too smirking all over his pointed face draco malfoy leaned across harry and seized the largest bowtruckle 
 
 maybe said malfoy in an undertone so that only harry could hear him the stupid great got himself badly injured 
 
 maybe you will if you shut up said harry out of the side of his mouth 
 
 maybe been messing with stuff too big for him if you get my drift 
 
 malfoy walked away smirking over his shoulder at harry who felt suddenly sick did malfoy know something his father was a death eater after all what if he had information about fate that had not yet reached the ears of the order he hurried back around the table to ron and hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it harry pulled out parchment and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what malfoy had just said 
 
 dumbledore would know if something had happened to hagrid said hermione at once just playing into hands to look worried it tells him we know exactly going on got to ignore him harry here hold the bowtruckle for a moment just so i can draw its face 
 
 yes came clear drawl from the group nearest them father was talking to the minister just a couple of days ago you know and it sounds as though the really determined to crack down on teaching in this place so even if that overgrown moron does show up again probably be sent packing straightaway 
 
 ouch 
 
 harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers leaving two long deep cuts there harry dropped it crabbe and goyle who had already been guffawing at the idea of hagrid being sacked laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the forest a little moving soon swallowed up among the tree roots when the bell echoed distantly over the grounds harry rolled up his bowtruckle picture and marched off to herbology with his hand wrapped in handkerchief and derisive laughter still ringing in his ears 
 
 if he calls hagrid a moron one more time said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 harry go picking a row with malfoy forget a prefect now he could make life difficult for you 
 
 wow i wonder what be like to have a difficult life said harry sarcastically ron laughed but hermione frowned together they traipsed across the vegetable patch the sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not 
 
 i just wish hagrid would hurry up and get back all said harry in a low voice as they reached the greenhouses and say that a better teacher he added threateningly 
 
 i going to said hermione calmly 
 
 because never be as good as hagrid said harry firmly fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary care of magical creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it 
 
 the door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some spilled out of it including ginny 
 
 hi she said brightly as she passed a few seconds later luna lovegood emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head when she saw harry her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him many of his classmates turned curiously to watch luna took a great breath and then said without so much as a preliminary hello i believe he who must not be named is back and i believe you fought him and escaped from him 
 
 erright said harry awkwardly luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings a fact that parvati and lavender seemed to have noticed as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes 
 
 you can laugh luna said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing but people used to believe there were no such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 well they were right they said hermione impatiently there any such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 luna gave her a withering look and flounced away radishes swinging madly parvati and lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now 
 
 mind not offending the only people who believe me harry asked hermione as they made their way into class 
 
 oh for sake harry you can do better than her said hermione told me all about her apparently only believe in things as long as no proof at all well i expect anything else from someone whose father runs the quibbler 
 
 harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how luna had said she could see them too his spirits sank slightly had she been lying but before he could devote much more thought to the matter ernie macmillan had stepped up to him 
 
 i want you to know potter he said in a loud carrying voice that not only weirdos who support you i personally believe you one hundred per cent my family have always stood firm behind dumbledore and so do i 
 
 erthanks very much ernie said harry taken aback but pleased ernie might be pompous on occasions like this but harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears words had certainly wiped the smile from lavender browns face and as he turned to talk to ron and hermione harry caught expression which looked both confused and defiant 
 
 to surprise professor sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of owls harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this he was starting to get an anxious twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do a feeling that worsened dramatically when professor sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung professor sprouts preferred type of fertiliser the gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later none of them talking very much it had been another long day 
 
 as harry was starving and he had his first detention with umbridge at five he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in gryffindor tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him he had barely reached the entrance of the great hall however when a loud and angry voice yelled oi potter 
 
 what now he muttered wearily turning to face angelina johnson who looked as though she was in a towering temper 
 
 tell you what now she said marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger how come landed yourself in detention for five on friday 
 
 what said harry why oh yeah keeper tryouts 
 
 now he remembers snarled angelina i tell you i wanted to do a tryout with the whole team and find someone who fitted in with i tell you booked the quidditch pitch specially and now decided not going to be there 
 
 i decide not to be there said harry stung by the injustice of these words i got detention from that umbridge woman just because i told her the truth about 
 
 well you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en friday said angelina fiercely and i care how you do it tell her a figment of your imagination if you like just make sure there 
 
 she turned on her heel and stormed away 
 
 you know what harry said to ron and hermione as they entered the great hall i think better check with puddlemere united whether oliver been killed during a training session because angelina seems to be channelling his spirit 
 
 what reckon are the odds of umbridge letting you off on friday said ron sceptically as they sat down at the gryffindor table 
 
 less than zero said harry glumly tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat better try though i offer to do two more detentions or something i dunno he swallowed a mouthful of potato and added i hope she keep me too long this evening you realise got to write three essays practise vanishing spells for mcgonagall work out a for flitwick finish the bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for trelawney 
 
 ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling 
 
 and it looks like going to rain 
 
 that got to do with our homework said hermione her eyebrows raised 
 
 nothing said ron at once his ears reddening 
 
 at five to five harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for office on the third floor when he knocked on the door she called come in in a sugary voice he entered cautiously looking around 
 
 he had known this office under three of its previous occupants 
 
 in the days when gilderoy lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself when lupin had occupied it it was likely you would meet some fascinating dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call in the impostor days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment 
 
 now however it looked totally unrecognisable the surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths there were several vases full of dried flowers each one residing on its own doily and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck these were so foul that harry stared at them transfixed until professor umbridge spoke again 
 
 good evening mr potter 
 
 harry started and looked around he had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her 
 
 evening professor umbridge harry said stiffly 
 
 well sit down she said pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a chair a piece of blank parchment lay on the table apparently waiting for him 
 
 er said harry without moving professor umbridge erbefore we start ii wanted to ask you a a favour 
 
 her bulging eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes 
 
 well in the gryffindor quidditch team and i was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new keeper at five on friday and i waswas wondering whether i could skip detention that night and do itdo it another night instead 
 
 he knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good 
 
 oh no said umbridge smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly oh no no no this is your punishment for spreading evil nasty stories mr potter and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty convenience no you will come here at five tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detentions as planned i think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do it ought to reinforce the lesson i am trying to teach you 
 
 harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears so he told evil nasty stones did he 
 
 she was watching him with her head slightly to one side still smiling widely as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again with a massive effort harry looked away from her dropped his schoolbag beside the chair and sat down 
 
 there said umbridge sweetly getting better at controlling our temper already we now you are going to be doing some lines for me mr potter no not with your quill she added as harry bent down to open his bag going to be using a rather special one of mine here you are 
 
 she handed him a long thin black quill with an unusually sharp point 
 
 i want you to write i must not tell lies she told him softly 
 
 how many times harry asked with a creditable imitation of politeness 
 
 oh as long as it takes for the message to sink in said umbridge sweetly off you go 
 
 she moved over to her desk sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking harry raised the sharp black quill then realised what was missing 
 
 you given me any ink he said 
 
 oh you need ink said professor umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice 
 
 harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote i must not tell lies 
 
 he let out a gasp of pain the words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink at the same time the words had appeared on the back of right hand cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel yet even as he stared at the shining cut the skin healed over again leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth 
 
 harry looked round at umbridge she was watching him her wide toadlike mouth stretched in a smile 
 
 yes 
 
 nothing said harry quietly 
 
 he looked back at the parchment placed the quill on it once more wrote i must not tell lies and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time once again the words had been cut into his skin once again they healed over seconds later 
 
 and on it went again and again harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink but his own blood and again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand healed and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment 
 
 darkness fell outside window harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop he did not even check his watch he knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any not even if he had to sit there all night cutting open his own hand with this quill 
 
 come here she said after what seemed hours 
 
 he stood up his hand was stinging painfully when he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed but that the skin there was red raw 
 
 hand she said 
 
 he extended it she took it in her own harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings 
 
 tut tut i seem to have made much of an impression yet she said smiling well just have to try again tomorrow evening we you may go 
 
 harry left her office without a word the school was quite deserted it was surely past midnight he walked slowly up the corridor then when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him broke into a run 
 
 he had not had time to practise vanishing spells had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle nor had he written his essays he skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of dreams for divination their first lesson and was surprised to find a dishevelled ron keeping him company 
 
 how come you do it last night harry asked as ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration ron who had been fast asleep when harry got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words 
 
 have to do he said slamming the diary shut said i dreamed i was buying a new pair of shoes she make anything weird out of that can she 
 
 they hurried off to north tower together 
 
 how was detention with umbridge anyway what did she make you do 
 
 harry hesitated for a fraction of a second then said lines 
 
 not too bad then eh said ron 
 
 nope said harry 
 
 heyi forgot did she let you off for friday 
 
 no said harry 
 
 ron groaned sympathetically 
 
 it was another bad day for harry he was one of the worst in transfiguration not having practised vanishing spells at all he had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle and meanwhile professors mcgonagall and sinistra gave them yet more homework which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with umbridge to cap it all angelina johnson tracked him down at dinner again and on learning that he would not be able to attend keeper tryouts told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments 
 
 in detention harry yelled after her as she stalked away think rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing quidditch 
 
 at least only lines said hermione consolingly as harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie which he no longer fancied very much not as it a dreadful punishment really 
 
 harry opened his mouth closed it again and nodded he was not really sure why he was not telling ron and hermione exactly what was happening in room he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face he also felt dimly that this was between himself and umbridge a private battle of wills and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it 
 
 i believe how much homework got said ron miserably 
 
 well why you do any last night hermione asked him where were you anyway 
 
 i was i fancied a walk said ron shiftily 
 
 harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment 
 
 the second detention was just as bad as the previous one the skin on the back of hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and umbridge would perhaps be satisfied he let no gasp of pain escape him however and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal again past midnight he said nothing but good evening and goodnight 
 
 his homework situation however was now desperate and when he returned to the gryffindor common room he did not though exhausted go to bed but opened his books and began moonstone essay it was half past two by the time he had finished it he knew he had done a poor job but there was no help for it unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with snape next he then dashed off answers to the questions professor mcgonagall had set them cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for professor and staggered up to bed where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately 
 
 thursday passed in a haze of tiredness ron seemed very sleepy too though harry could not see why he should be third detention passed in the same way as the previous two except that after two hours the words i must not tell lies did not fade from the back of hand but remained scratched there oozing droplets of blood the pause in the pointed quills scratching made professor umbridge look up 
 
 ah she said softly moving around her desk to examine his hand herself good that ought to serve as a reminder to you it you may leave for tonight 
 
 do i still have to come back tomorrow said harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge smiling as widely as before yes i think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work 
 
 harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than snape but as he walked back towards gryffindor tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender evil he thought as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor an evil twisted mad old 
 
 ron 
 
 he had reached the top of the stairs turned right and almost walked into ron who was lurking behind a statue of lachlan the lanky clutching his broomstick he gave a great leap of surprise when he saw harry and attempted to hide his new cleansweep eleven behind his back 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 ernothing what are you doing 
 
 harry frowned at him 
 
 come on you can tell me what are you hiding here for 
 
 hiding from fred and george if you must know said ron they just went past with a bunch of i bet testing stuff on them again i mean they do it in the common room now can they not with hermione there 
 
 he was talking in a very fast feverish way 
 
 but what have you got your broom for you been flying have you harry asked 
 
 iwellwell ok tell you but laugh all right ron said defensively turning redder with every second ii thought try out for gryffindor keeper now got a decent broom there go on laugh 
 
 not laughing said harry ron blinked a brilliant idea be really cool if you got on the team never seen you play keeper are you good 
 
 not bad said ron who looked immensely relieved at reaction charlie fred and george always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays 
 
 so been practising tonight 
 
 every evening since tuesday just on my own though been trying to bewitch quaffles to fly at me but it been easy and i know how much use be ron looked nervous and anxious fred and george are going to laugh themselves stupid when i turn up for the tryouts they stopped taking the mickey out of me since i got made a prefect 
 
 i wish i was going to be there said harry bitterly as they set off together towards the common room 
 
 yeah so do harry that on the back of your hand 
 
 harry who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand tried to hide it but had as much success as ron with his cleansweep 
 
 just a cut 
 
 but ron had grabbed forearm and pulled the back of hand up level with his eyes there was a pause during which he stared at the words carved into the skin then looking sick he released harry 
 
 i thought you said she was just giving you lines 
 
 harry hesitated but after all ron had been honest with him so he told ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in office 
 
 the old hag ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the fat lady who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame sick go to mcgonagall say something 
 
 no said harry at once not giving her the satisfaction of knowing got to me 
 
 got to let her get away with this 
 
 i know how much power got over her said harry 
 
 dumbledore then tell dumbledore 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 why not 
 
 got enough on his mind said harry but that was not the true reason he was not going to go to dumbledore for help when dumbledore had not spoken to him once since june 
 
 well i reckon you should ron began but he was interrupted by the fat lady who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out are you going to give me the password or will i have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation 
 
 friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week though harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the great hall it was without any real hope of seeing hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with umbridge 
 
 two things sustained harry that day one was the thought that it was almost the weekend the other was that dreadful though his final detention with umbridge was sure to be he had a distant view of the quidditch pitch from her window and might with luck be able to see something of tryout these were rather feeble rays of light it was true but harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness he had never had a worse first week of term at hogwarts 
 
 at five that evening he knocked on professor office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time and was told to enter the blank parchment lay ready for him on the table the pointed black quill beside it 
 
 you know what to do mr potter said umbridge smiling sweetly at him 
 
 harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window if he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it he now had a distant view of the gryffindor quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts apparently awaiting their turn to keep it was impossible to tell which one was ron at this distance 
 
 i must not tell wrote the cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh 
 
 i must not tell cut dug deeper stinging and smarting 
 
 i must not tell trickled down his wrist 
 
 he chanced another glance out of the window whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed katie bell scored twice in the few seconds harry dared to watch hoping very much that the keeper ron he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 he looked up whenever he thought he could risk it when he could hear the scratching of quill or the opening of a desk drawer the third person to try out was pretty good the fourth was terrible the fifth dodged a bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save the sky was darkening and harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 the parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain when he next looked up night had fallen and the quidditch pitch was no longer visible 
 
 see if got the message yet shall we said soft voice half an hour later 
 
 she moved towards him stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm and then as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin pain seared not across the back of his hand but across the scar on his forehead at the same time he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff 
 
 he wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet staring at her she looked back at him a smile stretching her wide slack mouth 
 
 yes it hurts it she said softly 
 
 he did not answer his heart was thumping very hard and fast was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead 
 
 well i think made my point mr potter you may go 
 
 he caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could 
 
 stay calm he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs stay calm it necessarily mean what you think it means 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he gasped at the fat lady who swung forwards once more 
 
 a roar of sound greeted him ron came running towards him beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching 
 
 harry i did it in keeper 
 
 what oh brilliant said harry trying to smile naturally while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled 
 
 have a butterbeer ron pressed a bottle on him i believe hermione gone 
 
 there said fred who was also swigging butterbeer and pointed to an armchair by the fire hermione was dozing in it her drink tipping precariously in her hand 
 
 well she said she was pleased when i told her said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 let her sleep said george hastily it was a few moments before harry noticed that several of the gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds 
 
 come here ron and see if old robes fit you called kade bell we can take off his name and put yours on instead 
 
 as ron moved away angelina came striding up to harry 
 
 sorry i was a bit short with you earlier potter she said abruptly stressful this managing lark you know starting to think i was a bit hard on wood sometimes she was watching ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face 
 
 look i know your best mate but not fabulous she said bluntly i think with a bit of training be all right though he comes from a family of good quidditch players banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest vicky frobisher and geoffrey hooper both flew better this evening but a real whiner always moaning about something or other and involved in all sorts of societies she admitted herself that if training clashed with her charms club put charms first anyway having a practice session at two tomorrow so just make sure there this time and do me a favour and help ron as much as you can ok 
 
 he nodded and angelina strolled back to alicia spinnet harry moved over to sit next to hermione who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag 
 
 oh harry you good about ron it she said blearily just sososo tired she yawned i was up until one making more hats disappearing like mad 
 
 and sure enough now that he looked harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up 
 
 great said harry distractedly if he did not tell somebody soon he would burst listen hermione i was just up in office and she touched my arm 
 
 hermione listened closely when harry had finished she said slowly worried controlling her like he controlled quirrell 
 
 well said harry dropping his voice a possibility it 
 
 i suppose so said hermione though she sounded unconvinced but i think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean properly alive again now he got his own body he need to share someone he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose 
 
 harry watched fred george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment then hermione said but last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you and dumbledore say it had to do with what was feeling at the time i mean maybe this got anything to do with umbridge at all maybe just coincidence it happened while you were with her 
 
 evil said harry flatly twisted 
 
 horrible yes but harry i think you ought to tell dumbledore your scar hurt 
 
 it was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to dumbledore and his answer to hermione was just the same as his answer to ron 
 
 not bothering him with this like you just said not a big deal been hurting on and off all summerit was just a bit worse tonight all 
 
 harry sure dumbledore would want to be bothered by this 
 
 yeah said harry before he could stop himself the only bit of me dumbledore cares about it my scar 
 
 say that not true 
 
 i think write and tell sirius about it see what he thinks 
 
 harry you put something like that in a letter said hermione looking alarmed you remember moody told us to be careful what we put in writing we just guarantee owls being intercepted any more 
 
 all right all right i tell him then said harry irritably he got to his feet going to bed tell ron for me will you 
 
 oh no said hermione looking relieved if going that means i can go too without being rude absolutely exhausted and i want to make some more hats tomorrow listen you can help me if you like quite fun getting better i can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now 
 
 harry looked into her face which was shining with glee and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer 
 
 er no i think i will thanks he said ernot tomorrow got loads of homework to do 
 
 and he traipsed off to the boys stairs leaving her looking slightly disappointed

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the secret riddlecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 katie was removed to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the details were confused and nobody other than harry ron hermione and leanne seemed to know that katie herself had not been the intended target 
 
 oh and malfoy knows of course said harry to ron and hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever harry mentioned his theory 
 
 harry had wondered whether dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for monday lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside office at eight knocked and was told to enter there sat dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he smiled when he gestured to harry to sit down the pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling 
 
 you have had a busy time while i have been away dumbledore said i believe you witnessed accident 
 
 yes sir how is she 
 
 still very unwell although she was relatively lucky she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there was a tiny hole in her glove had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly luckily professor snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse 
 
 why him asked harry quickly why not madam pomfrey 
 
 impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and phineas nigellus black raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping i would not have permitted a student to question the way hogwarts operated in my day 
 
 yes thank you phineas said dumbledore quellingly professor snape knows much more about the dark arts than madam pomfrey harry anyway the st staff are sending me hourly reports and i am hopeful that katie will make a full recovery in time 
 
 where were you this weekend sir harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by phineas nigellus who hissed softly 
 
 i would rather not say just now said dumbledore however i shall tell you in due course 
 
 you will said harry startled 
 
 yes i expect so said dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand 
 
 sir said harry tentatively i met mundungus in hogsmeade 
 
 ah yes i am already aware that mundungus has been treating your inheritance with contempt said dumbledore frowning a little he has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the three broomsticks i rather think he dreads facing me however rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of old possessions 
 
 that mangy old has been stealing black heirlooms said phineas nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 professor said harry after a short pause did professor mcgonagall tell you what i told her after katie got hurt about draco malfoy 
 
 she told me of your suspicions yes said dumbledore 
 
 and do you 
 
 i shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in accident said dumbledore but what concerns me now harry is our lesson 
 
 harry felt slightly resentful at this if their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second however he said no more about draco malfoy but watched as dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his hands 
 
 you will remember i am sure that we left the tale of lord beginnings at the point where the handsome muggle tom riddle had abandoned his witch wife merope and returned to his family home in little hangleton merope was left alone in london expecting the baby who would one day become lord voldemort 
 
 how do you know she was in london sir 
 
 because of the evidence of one caractacus burke said dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing 
 
 he swilled the contents of the pensieve as harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes 
 
 yes we acquired it in curious circumstances it was brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many years ago now she said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious covered in rags and pretty far along going to have a baby see she said the locket had been well we hear that sort of story all the time oh this was this was his favorite teapot but when i looked at it it had his mark all right and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth of course that made it near enough priceless she seem to have any idea how much it was worth happy to get ten galleons for it best bargain we ever made 
 
 dumbledore gave the pensieve an shake and caractacus burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come 
 
 he only gave her ten galleons said harry indignantly 
 
 caractacus burke was not famed for his generosity said dumbledore so we know that near the end of her pregnancy merope was alone in london and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of treasured family heirlooms 
 
 but she could do magic said harry impatiently she could have got food and everything for herself by magic she 
 
 ah said dumbledore perhaps she could but it is my beliefi am guessing again but i am sure i am rightthat when her husband abandoned her merope stopped using magic i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen in any case as you are about to see merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life 
 
 she even stay alive for her son 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows 
 
 could you possibly be feeling sorry for lord voldemort 
 
 no said harry quickly but she had a choice she not like my mother 
 
 your mother had a choice too said dumbledore gently yes merope riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly harry she was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your courage and now if you will stand 
 
 where are we going harry asked as dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk 
 
 this time said dumbledore we are going to enter my memory i think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate after you harry 
 
 harry bent over the pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and dumbledore were standing in a bustling london street 
 
 there i am said dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a milk cart 
 
 this younger albus long hair and beard were auburn having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing 
 
 nice suit sir said harry before he could stop himself but dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings he mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once after a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron 
 
 good afternoon i have an appointment with a mrs cole who i believe is the matron here 
 
 oh said the girl taking in eccentric appearance um just a mo mrs cole she bellowed over her shoulder 
 
 harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response the girl turned back to dumbledore 
 
 come in on er way 
 
 dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean harry and the older dumbledore followed before the front door had closed behind them a skinny woman came scurrying toward them she had a face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward dumbledore 
 
 and take the iodine upstairs to martha billy stubbs has been picking his scabs and eric oozing all over his sheetschicken pox on top of everything else she said to nobody in particular and then her eyes fell upon dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold 
 
 good afternoon said dumbledore holding out his hand 
 
 mrs cole simply gaped 
 
 my name is albus dumbledore i sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today 
 
 mrs cole blinked apparently deciding that dumbledore was not a hallucination she said feebly oh yes wellwell better come into my room yes 
 
 she led dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office it was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched she invited dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously 
 
 i am here as i told you in my letter to discuss tom riddle and arrangements for his future said dumbledore 
 
 are you family asked mrs cole 
 
 no i am a teacher said dumbledore i have come to offer tom a place at my school 
 
 what this then 
 
 it is called hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 and how come interested in tom 
 
 we believe he has qualities we are looking for 
 
 you mean won a scholarship how can he have done never been entered for one 
 
 well his name has been down for our school since birth 
 
 who registered him his parents 
 
 there was no doubt that mrs cole was an inconveniently sharp woman apparently dumbledore thought so too for harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from mrs desktop 
 
 here said dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper i think this will make everything clear 
 
 mrs eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment 
 
 that seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before 
 
 ermay i offer you a glass of gin she said in an voice 
 
 thank you very much said dumbledore beaming 
 
 it soon became clear that mrs cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp smacking her lips frankly she smiled at dumbledore for the first time and he hesitate to press his advantage 
 
 i was wondering whether you could tell me anything of tom history i think he was born here in the orphanage 
 
 right said mrs cole helping herself to more gin i remember it clear as anything because just started here myself new eve and bitter cold snowing you know nasty night and this girl not much older than i was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps well she the first we took her in and she had the baby within the hour and she was dead in another hour 
 
 mrs cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin 
 
 did she say anything before she died asked dumbledore anything about the father for instance 
 
 now as it happens she did said mrs cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story i remember she said to me i hope he looks like his papa and i lie she was right to hope it because she was no beautyand then she told me he was to be named tom for his father and marvolo for her fatheryes i know funny name it we wondered whether she came from a circusand she said the surname was to be riddle and she died soon after that without another word 
 
 well we named him just as said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no tom nor marvolo nor any kind of riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and been here ever since 
 
 mrs cole helped herself almost to another healthy measure of gin two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones then she said a funny boy 
 
 yes said dumbledore i thought he might be 
 
 he was a funny baby too he hardly ever cried you know and then when he got a little older he was odd 
 
 odd in what way asked dumbledore gently 
 
 well he 
 
 but mrs cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot dumbledore over her gin glass 
 
 definitely got a place at your school you say 
 
 definitely said dumbledore 
 
 and nothing i say can change that 
 
 nothing said dumbledore 
 
 be taking him away whatever 
 
 whatever repeated dumbledore gravely 
 
 she squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush he scares the other children 
 
 you mean he is a bully asked dumbledore 
 
 i think he must be said mrs cole frowning slightly but very hard to catch him at it there have been incidents nasty things 
 
 dumbledore did not press her though harry could tell that he was interested she took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still 
 
 billy rabbit well tom said he do it and i see how he could have done but even so it hang itself from the rafters did it 
 
 i think so no said dumbledore quietly 
 
 but jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it all i know is he and billy had argued the day before and cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time on the summer outingwe take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seasidewell amy benson and dennis bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that gone into a cave with tom riddle he swore just gone exploring but something happened in there sure of it and well there have been a lot of things funny things 
 
 she looked around at dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady 
 
 i think many people will be sorry to see the back of him 
 
 you understand sure that we will not be keeping him permanently said dumbledore he will have to return here at the very least every summer 
 
 oh well better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said mrs cole with a slight hiccup she got to her feet and harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady even though of the gin was now gone i suppose like to see him 
 
 very much said dumbledore rising too 
 
 she led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed the orphans harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic they looked reasonably for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up 
 
 here we are said mrs cole as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor she knocked twice and entered 
 
 tom got a visitor this is mr dumbertonsorry dunderbore come to tell youwell let him do it 
 
 harry and the two dumbledores entered the room and mrs cole closed the door on them it was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead a boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book 
 
 there was no trace of the gaunts in tom face merope had got her dying wish he was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old and pale his eyes narrowed slightly as he took in eccentric appearance there was a silence 
 
 how do you do tom said dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand 
 
 the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor 
 
 i am professor dumbledore 
 
 professor repeated riddle he looked wary is that like doctor what are you here for did she get you in to have a look at me 
 
 he was pointing at the door through which mrs cole had just left 
 
 no no said dumbledore smiling 
 
 i believe you said riddle she wants me looked at she tell the truth 
 
 he spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking it was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before his eyes had widened and he was glaring at dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly after a few seconds riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still 
 
 who are you 
 
 i have told you my name is professor dumbledore and i work at a school called hogwarts i have come to offer you a place at my schoolyour new school if you would like to come 
 
 reaction to this was most surprising he leapt from the bed and backed away from dumbledore looking furious 
 
 you kid me the asylum where from it professor yes of coursewell not going see that old the one who should be in the asylum i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them tell you 
 
 i am not from the asylum said dumbledore patiently i am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly i shall tell you about hogwarts of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you 
 
 like to see them try sneered riddle 
 
 hogwarts dumbledore went on as though he had not heard last words is a school for people with special abilities 
 
 not mad 
 
 i know that you are not mad hogwarts is not a school for mad people it is a school of magic 
 
 there was silence riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of as though trying to catch one of them lying 
 
 magic he repeated in a whisper 
 
 right said dumbledore 
 
 magic what i can do 
 
 what is it that you can do 
 
 all sorts breathed riddle a flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered i can make things move without touching them i can make animals do what i want them to do without training them i can make bad things happen to people who annoy me i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 his legs were trembling he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer 
 
 i knew i was different he whispered to his own quivering fingers i knew i was special always i knew there was something 
 
 well you were quite right said dumbledore who was no longer smiling but watching riddle intently you are a wizard 
 
 riddle lifted his head his face was transfigured there was a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial 
 
 are you a wizard too 
 
 yes i am 
 
 prove it said riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said tell the truth 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows if as i take it you are accepting your place at hogwarts 
 
 of course i am 
 
 then you will address me as professor or sir 
 
 expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice sorry sir i meantplease professor could you show me 
 
 harry was sure that dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of muggles and must therefore be cautious to his great surprise however dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick 
 
 the wardrobe burst into flames 
 
 riddle jumped to his feet harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there but even as riddle rounded on dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged 
 
 riddle stared from the wardrobe to dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand where can i get one of them 
 
 all in good time said dumbledore i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe 
 
 and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it for the first time riddle looked frightened 
 
 open the door said dumbledore 
 
 riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door on the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it 
 
 take it out said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took down the quaking box he looked unnerved 
 
 is there anything in that box that you ought not to have asked dumbledore 
 
 riddle threw dumbledore a long clear calculating look yes i suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice 
 
 open it said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday objects a a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets 
 
 you will return them to their owners with your apologies said dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket i shall know whether it has been done and be warned thieving is not tolerated at hogwarts 
 
 riddle did not look remotely abashed he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at dumbledore at last he said in a colorless voice yes sir 
 
 at hogwarts dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it you have inadvertently i am surebeen using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school you are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you but you should know that hogwarts can expel students and the ministry of magicyes there is a ministrywill punish lawbreakers still more severely all new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws 
 
 yes sir said riddle again 
 
 it was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box when he had finished he turned to dumbledore and said baldly i got any money 
 
 that is easily remedied said dumbledore drawing a leather from his pocket there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes you might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but 
 
 where do you buy spellbooks interrupted riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold galleon 
 
 in diagon alley said dumbledore i have your list of books and school equipment with me i can help you find everything 
 
 coming with me asked riddle looking up 
 
 certainly if you 
 
 i need you said riddle used to doing things for myself i go round london on my own all the time how do you get to this diagon alleysir he added catching eye 
 
 harry thought that dumbledore would insist upon accompanying riddle but once again he was surprised dumbledore handed riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling riddle exactly how to get to the leaky cauldron from the orphanage he said you will be able to see it although muggles around people that iswill not ask for tom the barmaneasy enough to remember as he shares your name 
 
 riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly 
 
 you dislike the name tom 
 
 there are a lot of toms muttered riddle then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked was my father a wizard he was called tom riddle too told me 
 
 afraid i know said dumbledore his voice gentle 
 
 my mother have been magic or she have died said riddle more to himself than dumbledore it been him sowhen got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts 
 
 all the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said dumbledore you will leave from cross station on the first of september there is a train ticket in there too 
 
 riddle nodded dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again taking it riddle said i can speak to snakes i found out when been to the country on tripsthey find me they whisper to me is that normal for a wizard 
 
 harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress 
 
 it is unusual said dumbledore after a hesitation but not unheard of 
 
 his tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over face they stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other then the handshake was broken dumbledore was at the door 
 
 goodbye tom i shall see you at hogwarts 
 
 i think that will do said the dumbledore at side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the office 
 
 sit down said dumbledore landing beside harry 
 
 harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen 
 
 he believed it much quicker than i didi mean when you told him he was a wizard said harry i believe hagrid at first when he told me 
 
 yes riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he wasto use his said dumbledore 
 
 did you knowthen asked harry 
 
 did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time said dumbledore no i had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is however i was certainly intrigued by him i returned to hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something i should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already i felt i ought to do for others sake as much as his 
 
 his powers as you heard were surprisingly for such a young wizard andmost interestingly and ominously of allhe had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously and as you saw they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards he was already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control the little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 and he was a parselmouth interjected harry 
 
 yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark arts although as we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too in fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination 
 
 time is making fools of us again said dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings 
 
 firstly i hope you noticed reaction when i mentioned that another shared his first name tom 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 there he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary even then he wished to be different separate notorious he shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of lord voldemort behind which he has been hidden for so long 
 
 i trust that you also noticed that tom riddle was already highly secretive and apparently friendless he did not want help or companionship on his trip to diagon alley he preferred to operate alone the adult voldemort is the same you will hear many of his death eaters claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him they are deluded lord voldemort has never had a friend nor do i believe that he has ever wanted one 
 
 and lastly i hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this harrythe young tom riddle liked to collect trophies you saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room these were taken from victims of his bullying behavior souvenirs if you will of particularly unpleasant bits of magic bear in mind this tendency for this particularly will be important later 
 
 and now it really is time for bed 
 
 harry got to his feet as he walked across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which marvolo ring had rested last time but the ring was no longer there 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore for harry had come to a halt 
 
 the gone said harry looking around but i thought i you might have the mouth organ or something 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his spectacles 
 
 very astute harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ 
 
 and on that enigmatic note he waved to harry who understood himself to be dismissed

 good day minister 
 
 harry watched thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor the moment the minister had passed out of sight harry tugged the invisibility cloak out from under his heavy black cloak threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction runcorn was so tall that harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden 
 
 panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach as he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door each bearing a small plaque with the owners name and occupation upon it the might of the ministry its complexity its impenetrability seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with ron and hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish they had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected they had not given a moments thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate now hermione was stuck in court proceedings which would undoubtedly last hours ron was struggling to do magic that harry was sure was beyond him a womans liberty possibly depending on the outcome and he harry was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift 
 
 he stopped walking leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do the silence pressed upon him there was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the corridors were as hushed as though the muffliato charm had been cast over the place 
 
 her office must be up here harry thought 
 
 it seemed most unlikely that umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure he therefore set off along the corridor again passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him scribbling on a trail of parchment 
 
 now paying attention to the names on the doors harry turned a corner halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks though much more highly polished and free from graffiti harry paused to watch them for the effect was quite mesmerizing they were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites after a few seconds harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets c that the paper squares were pages which when assembled folded and magicked into place fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard 
 
 harry crept closer although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a footstep and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch he examined it beneath the invisibility cloak its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title 
 
 
 
 
 mudbloods 
 and the dangers they pose to a peaceful society 
 beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl there was no authors name upon the pamphlet but again the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said still waving and twirling her wand will the old hag be interrogating mudbloods all day does anyone know 
 
 careful said the wizard beside her glancing around nervously one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor 
 
 what has she got magic ears as well as an eye now 
 
 the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of harry looked too and the rage reared in him like a snake where there might have been a peephole on a muggle front door a large round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood c an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known alastor moody 
 
 for a split second harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there he even forgot that he was invisible he strode straight over to the door to examine the eye it was not moving it gazed blindly upward frozen the plaque beneath it read 
 
 
 
 
 dolores umbridge 
 senior undersecretary to the minister 
 
 
 
 below that a slightly shinier new plaque read 
 
 
 
 
 head of the registration commission 
 
 
 
 harry looked back at the dozen though they were intent upon their work he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them he therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a horn for a body crouching down beneath the cloak he placed the decoy detonator on the ground 
 
 it scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him a few moments later during which harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner the young witch in the front row shrieked pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up looking around for the source of the commotion harry turned the doorknob stepped into umbridges office and closed the door behind him 
 
 he felt he had stepped back in time the room was exactly like umbridges office at hogwarts lace draperies doilies and dried flowers covered every surface the walls bore the same ornamental plates each featuring a highly colored beribboned kitten gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness the desk was covered with a flouncy flowered cloth behind eye a telescopic attachment enabled umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the decoy detonator he wrenched the telescope out of the door leaving a hole behind pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket the he turned to face the room again raised his wand and murmured accio locker 
 
 nothing happened but he had not expected it to no doubt umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells he therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers he saw quills and notebooks and spellotape enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had be beaten back a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips but no sign of a locket 
 
 there was a filing cabinet behind the desk harry set to searching it like filchs filing cabinet at hogwarts it was full of folders each labeled with a name it was not until harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search mr weasleys file 
 
 he pulled it out and opened it 
 
 
 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 
 
 
 blood status 
 pureblood but with unacceptable leanings known member of the order of the phoenix 
 
 family 
 wife pureblood seven children two youngest at hogwarts nb youngest son currently at home seriously ill ministry inspectors have confirmed 
 
 security status 
 tracked all movements are being monitored strong likelihood undesirable no will contact has stayed with weasley family previously 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 undesirable number one harry muttered under his breath as he replaced mr weasleys folder and shut the drawer he had an idea he knew who that was and sure enough as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on the wall with the words undesirable no emblazoned across his chest a little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner harry moved across to read it and saw that umbridge had written to be punished 
 
 angrier than ever he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there he gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror propped up on a bookcase beside the desk 
 
 harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up but realized that the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat c the life and lies of albus dumbledore c nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest by rita skeeter bestselling author of armando dippet master or moron 
 
 harry opened the book at random and saw a photograph of two teenage boys both laughing immoderately with their arms around each others shoulders dumbledore now with hair had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on krums chin that had so annoyed ron the boy who roared in silent amusement beside dumbledore had a gleeful wild look about him his golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders harry wondered whether it was a young doge but before he could check the caption the door of the office opened 
 
 if thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered harry would not have had time to pull the invisibility cloak over himself as it was he thought thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still staring curiously at the place where harry had just vanished perhaps deciding that that all he had seen was dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book for harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot it sprang out and began scribbling a note to umbridge very slowly hardly daring to breathe harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond 
 
 the were still clustered around the remains of the decoy detonator which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said i bet it sneaked up here from experimental charms theyre so careless remember that poisonous duck 
 
 speeding back toward the lifts harry reviewed his options it had never been likely that the locket was here at the ministry and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court their priority now had to be to leave the ministry before they were exposed and try again another day the first thing to do was to find ron and then they could work out a way of extracting hermione from the courtroom 
 
 the lift was empty when it arrived harry jumped in and pulled off the invisibility cloak as it started its descent to his enormous relief when it rattled to a halt at level two a and ron got in 
 
 he stammered to harry as the lift set off again 
 
 ron its me harry 
 
 harry blimey i forgot what you looked like c why isnt hermione with you 
 
 she had to go down to the courtrooms with umbridge she couldnt refuse and c 
 
 but before harry could finish the lift had stopped again the doors opened and mr weasley walked inside talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill 
 
 i quite understand what youre saying wakanda but im afraid i cannot be party to c 
 
 mr weasley broke off he had noticed harry it was very strange to have mr weasley glare at him with that much dislike the lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more 
 
 oh hello reg said mr weasley looking around at the sound of steady dripping from rons robes isnt your wife in for questioning today er c whats happened to you why are you so wet 
 
 yaxleys office is raining said ron he addressed mr weasleys shoulder and harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each others eyes i couldnt stop it so theyve sent me to get bernie c pillsworth i think they said c 
 
 yes a lot of offices have been raining lately said mr weasley did you try meterolojinx recanto it worked for bletchley 
 
 meteolojinx recanto whispered ron no i didnt thanks d c i mean thanks arthur 
 
 the lift doors opened the old witch with the anthill hair left and ron darted past her out of sight harry made to follow him but found his path blocked as percy weasley strode into the lift his nose buried in some papers he was reading 
 
 not until the doors had clanged shut again did percy realize he was in a lit with his father he glanced up saw mr weasley turned radish red and left the lift the moment the doors opened again for the second time harry tried to get out but this time found his way blocked by mr weasleys arm 
 
 one moment runcorn 
 
 the lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor mr weasley said i hear you had information about dirk cresswell 
 
 harry had the impression that mr weasleys anger was no less because of the brush with percy he decided his best chance was to act stupid 
 
 sorry he said 
 
 dont pretend runcorn said mr weasley fiercely you tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didnt you 
 
 i c so what if i did said harry 
 
 so dirk cresswell is ten times the wizard you are said mr weasley quietly as the lift sank ever lower and if he survives azkaban youll have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends c 
 
 arthur harry interrupted you know youre being tracked dont you 
 
 is that a threat runcorn said mr weasley loudly 
 
 no said harry its a fact theyre watching your every move c 
 
 the lift doors opened they had reached the atrium mr weasley gave harry a scathing look and swept from the lift harry stood there shaken he wished he was impersonating somebody other than runcorn the lift doors clanged shut 
 
 harry pulled out the invisibility cloak and put it back on he would try to extricate hermione on his own while ron was dealing with the raining office when the doors opened he stepped out into a stone passageway quite different from the and carpeted corridors above as the left rattled away again harry shivered slightly looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the department of mysteries 
 
 he set off his destination not the black door but the doorway he remembered on the left hand side which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers his mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them he still had a couple of decoy detonators but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door enter as runcorn and ask for a quick word with mafalda of course he did not know whether runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this and even if he managed it hermiones might trigger a search before they were clear of the ministry 
 
 lost in thought he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog it was becoming colder and colder with every step he took a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs and then he felt that stealing sense of despair or hopelessness filling him expanding inside him 
 
 dementors he thought 
 
 and as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene the dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall figures their faces completely hidden their ragged breathing the only sound in the place the petrified brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches most of them were hiding their faces in their hands perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors greedy mouths some were accompanied by families others sat alone the dementors were gliding up and down in front of them and the cold and the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid themselves upon harry like a curse 
 
 fight it he told himself but he knew that he could not conjure a patronus here without revealing himself instantly so he moved forward as silently as he could and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain but he forced himself to think of hermione and of ron who needed him 
 
 moving through the towering black figures was terrifying the eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed and he felt sure that they sensed him sensed perhaps a human presence that still had some hope some resilience 
 
 and then abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it 
 
 no no im im i tell you my father was a wizard he was look him up arkie alderton hes a well known broomstick designer look him up i tell you c get your hands off me get your hands off c 
 
 this is your final warning said umbridges soft voice magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the mans desperate screams if you struggle you will be subjected to the dementors kiss 
 
 the mans screams subsided but dry sobs echoed through the corridor 
 
 take him away said umbridge 
 
 two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom their rotting scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting they glided away down the corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight 
 
 next c mary cattermole called umbridge 
 
 a small woman stood up she was trembling from head to foot her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes her face was completely bloodless as she passed the dementors harry saw her shudder 
 
 he did it instinctively without any sort of plan because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon as the door began to swing closed he slipped into the courtroom behind her 
 
 it was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic this one was much smaller though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well 
 
 there were more dementors in here casting their freezing aura over the place they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform here behind a balustrade sat umbridge with yaxley on one side of her and hermione quite as as mrs cattermole on the other at the foot of the platform a cat prowled up and down up and down and harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors that was for the accused to feel not the accusers 
 
 sit down said umbridge in her soft silky voice 
 
 mrs cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform the moment she had sat down chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there 
 
 you are mary elizabeth cattermole asked umbridge 
 
 mrs cattermole gave a single shaky nod 
 
 married to reginald cattermole of the magical maintenance department 
 
 mrs cattermole burst into tears 
 
 i dont know where he is he was supposed to meet me here 
 
 umbridge ignored her 
 
 mother to maisie ellie and alfred cattermole 
 
 mrs cattermole sobbed harder than ever 
 
 theyre frightened they think that i might not come home c 
 
 spare us spat yaxley the brats of mudbloods do not stir our sympathies 
 
 mrs cattermoles sobs masked harrys footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform the moment he had passed the place where the patronus cat patrolled he felt the change in temperature it was warm and comfortable here the patronus he was sure was umbridges and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here in her element upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind umbridge yaxley and hermione taking a seat behind the latter he was worried about making hermione jump he thought of casting the muffliato charm upon umbridge and yaxley but even murmuring the word might cause hermione alarm then umbridge raised her voice to address mrs cattermole and harry seized his chance 
 
 im behind you he whispered into hermiones ear 
 
 as he had expected she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview but both umbridge and yaxley were concentrating upon mrs cattermole and this went unnoticed 
 
 a wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the ministry today mrs cattermole umbridge was saying inches cherry core do you recognize the description 
 
 mrs cattermole nodded mopping her eyes on her sleeve 
 
 could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand 
 
 sobbed mrs cattermole i didnt it from anybody i it when i was eleven years old it c it c it c chose me 
 
 she cried harder than ever 
 
 umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made harry want to attack her she leaned forward over the barrier the better to observe her victim and something gold swung forward too and dangled over the void the locket 
 
 hermione had seen it she let out a little squeak but umbridge and yaxley still intent upon their prey were deaf to everything else 
 
 no said umbridge no i dont think so mrs cattermole wands only choose witches or wizards you are not a witch i have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here c mafalda pass them to me 
 
 umbridge held out a small hand she looked so toadlike at that moment that harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers hermiones hands were shaking with shock she fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with mrs cattermoles name on it 
 
 thats c thats pretty dolores she said pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of umbridges blouse 
 
 what snapped umbridge glancing down oh yes c an old family heirloom she said patting the locket lying on her large bosom the s stands for selwyn i am related to the selwyns indeed there are few families to whom i am not related a pity she continued in a louder voice flicking through mrs cattermoles questionnaire that the same cannot be said for you parents professions greengrocers 
 
 yaxley laughed jeeringly below the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down and the dementors stood waiting in the corners 
 
 it was umbridges lie that brought the blood surging into harrys brain and obliterated his sense of caution c that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own credentials he raised his wand not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the invisibility cloak and said stupefy 
 
 there was a flash of red light umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade mrs cattermoles papers slid off her lap onto the floor and down below the prowling silver cat vanished air hit them like an oncoming wind yaxley confused looked around for the source of the trouble and saw harrys disembodied hand and wand pointing at him he tried to draw his own wand but too late stupefy 
 
 yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor 
 
 harry 
 
 hermione if you think i was going to sit here and let her pretend c 
 
 harry mrs cattermole 
 
 harry whirled around throwing off the invisibility cloak down below the dementors had moved out of their corners they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair whether because the patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control they seemed to have abandoned restraint mrs cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 the silver stag soared from the tip of harrys wand and leaped toward the dementors which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again the stags light more powerful and more warming than the cats protection filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room 
 
 get the horcrux harry told hermione 
 
 he ran back down the steps stuffing the invisibility cloak into his back and approached mrs cattermole 
 
 you she whispered gazing into his face but c but reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning 
 
 did i muttered harry tugging at the chains binding her arms well ive had a change of heart diffindo nothing happened hermione how do i get rid of these chains 
 
 wait im trying something up here c 
 
 hermione were surrounded by dementors 
 
 i know that harry but if she wakes up and the lockets gone c i need to duplicate it c geminio there that should fool her 
 
 hermione came running downstairs 
 
 lets see relashio 
 
 the chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair mrs cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before 
 
 i dont understand she whispered 
 
 youre going to leave here with us said harry pulling her to her feet go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if youve got to disguise yourselves and run youve seen how it is you wont get anything like a fair hearing here 
 
 harry said hermione how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door 
 
 patronuses said harry pointing his wand at his own the stag slowed and walked still gleaming brightly toward the door as many as we can muster do yours hermione 
 
 expec c expecto patronum said hermione nothing happened 
 
 its the only spell she ever has trouble with harry told a completely bemused mrs cattermole bit unfortunate really come on hermione 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 a silver otter burst from the end of hermiones wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag 
 
 cmon said harry and he led hermione and mrs cattermole to the door 
 
 when the patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside harry looked around the dementors were falling back on both sides of them melding into the darkness scattering before the silver creatures 
 
 its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families harry told the waiting who were dazzled by the light of the patronuses and still cowering slightly go abroad if you can just get well away from the ministry thats the c er c new official position now if youll just follow the patronuses youll be able to leave the atrium 
 
 they managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted but as they approached the lifts harry started to have misgivings if they emerged into the atrium with a silver stag and otter soaring alongside it and twenty or so people half of them accused he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention he had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them 
 
 reg screamed mrs cattermole and she threw herself into rons arms runcorn let me out he attacked umbridge and yaxley and hes told all of us to leave the country i think wed better do it reg i really do lets hurry home and fetch the children and c why are you so wet 
 
 water muttered ron disengaging himself harry they know there are intruders inside the ministry something about a hole in umbridges office door i reckon weve got five minutes if that c 
 
 hermiones patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to harry 
 
 harry if were trapped here c 
 
 we wont be if we move fast said harry he addressed the silent group behind them who were all gawping at him 
 
 whos got wands 
 
 about half of them raised their hands 
 
 okay all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has well need to be fast before they stop us come on 
 
 they managed to cram themselves into two lifts harrys patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise 
 
 level eight said the witchs cool voice atrium 
 
 harry knew at once that they were in trouble the atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace sealing them off 
 
 harry squeaked hermione what are we going to c 
 
 stop harry thundered and the powerful voice of runcorn echoed through the atrium the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze follow me he whispered to the group of terrified who moved forward in a huddle shepherded by ron and hermione 
 
 whats up albert said the same balding wizard who had followed harry out of the fireplace earlier he looked nervous 
 
 this lot need to leave before you seal the exits said harry with all the authority he could muster 
 
 the group of wizards in front of him looked at one another 
 
 weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone c 
 
 are you contradicting me harry blustered would you like me to have your family tree examined like i had dirk cresswells 
 
 sorry gasped the balding wizard backing away i didnt mean nothing albert but i thought i thought they were in for questioning and 
 
 their blood is pure said harry and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall purer than many of yours i daresay off you go he boomed to the who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs the ministry wizards hung back some looking confused others scared and fearful then 
 
 mary 
 
 mrs cattermole looked over her shoulder the real reg cattermole no longer vomiting but pale and wan had just come running out of a lift 
 
 r reg 
 
 she looked from her husband to ron who swore loudly 
 
 the balding wizard gaped his head turning ludicrously from one reg cattermole to the other 
 
 hey c whats going on what is this 
 
 seal the exit seal it 
 
 yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the but mrs cattermole had now vanished as the balding wizard lifted his wand harry raised an enormous fist and punched him sending him flying through the air 
 
 hes been helping escape yaxley harry shouted 
 
 the balding wizards colleagues set up and uproar under cover of which ron grabbed mrs cattermole pulled her into the fireplace and disappeared confused yaxley looked from harry to the punched wizard while the real reg cattermole screamed my wife who was that with my wife whats going on 
 
 harry saw yaxleys head turn saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face 
 
 come on harry shouted at hermione he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as yaxleys curse sailed over harrys head they spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle harry flung open the door ron was standing there beside the sinks still wrestling with mrs cattermole 
 
 reg i dont understand c 
 
 let go im not your husband youve got to go home 
 
 there was a noise in the cubicle behind them harry looked around yaxley had just appeared 
 
 lets go harry yelled he seized hermione by the hand and ron by the arm and turned on the stop 
 
 darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compressing hands but something was wrong hermiones hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip 
 
 he wondered whether he was going to suffocate he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were rons arm and hermiones fingers which were slowly slipping away 
 
 and then he saw the door to number twelve grimmauld place with its serpent door knocker but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light hermiones hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 grandmother 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 grandmother is very old her face is wrinkled and her hair is 
 quite white but her eyes are like two stars and they have a mild 
 gentle expression in them when they look at you which does you 
 good she wears a dress of heavy rich silk with large flowers worked on it and it rustles when she moves and then she can tell the most wonderful stories grandmother knows a great deal for she was alive before father and mother quite certain she has a with large silver clasps in which she often reads and in the book between the leaves lies a rose quite flat and dry it is not so 
 pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass and yet she 
 smiles at it most pleasantly and tears even come into her eyes i 
 wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book 
 that way do you know why when tears fall upon the rose and she is looking at it the rose revives and fills the room 
 with its fragrance the walls vanish as in a mist and all around 
 her is the glorious green wood where in summer the sunlight streams 
 through thick foliage and grandmother why she is young again a 
 charming maiden fresh as a rose with round rosy cheeks fair 
 bright ringlets and a figure pretty and graceful but the eyes those 
 mild saintly eyes are the same they have been left to grandmother 
 at her side sits a young man tall and strong he gives her a rose and 
 she smiles grandmother cannot smile like that now yes she is 
 smiling at the memory of that day and many thoughts and recollections of the past but the handsome young man is gone and the rose has withered in the old book and grandmother is sitting there again an old woman looking down upon the withered rose in the book 
 grandmother is dead now she had been sitting in her 
 telling us a long beautiful tale and when it was finished she 
 said she was tired and leaned her head back to sleep awhile we could hear her gentle breathing as she slept gradually it became quieter and calmer and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace it was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine she smiled once more and then people said she was dead she was laid in a black coffin looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen though her eyes were closed but every wrinkle had vanished her hair looked white and silvery and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile 
 
 we did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who had 
 been such a dear good grandmother the in which the rose still lay was placed under her head for so she had wished it and then they buried grandmother 
 
 on the grave close by the churchyard wall they planted a 
 it was soon full of roses and the nightingale sat among 
 the flowers and sang over the grave from the organ in the church 
 sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms which were 
 written in the old book under the head of the dead one 
 
 the moon shone down upon the grave but the dead was not there 
 every child could go safely even at night and pluck a rose from 
 the tree by the churchyard wall the dead know more than we do who are living they know what a terror would come upon us if such a strange thing were to happen as the appearance of a dead person among us 
 
 they are better off than we are the dead return no more the earth 
 has been heaped on the coffin and it is earth only that lies within 
 it the leaves of the are dust and the rose with all its 
 recollections has crumbled to dust also but over the grave fresh 
 roses bloom the nightingale sings and the organ sounds and there 
 still lives a remembrance of old grandmother with the loving 
 gentle eyes that always looked young eyes can never die ours will 
 once again behold dear grandmother young and beautiful as when for the first time she kissed the fresh red rose that is now dust in 
 the grave

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter i 
 
 which treats of the manner of entering a convent 
 it was into this house that jean valjean had as fauchelevent expressed it fallen from the sky 
 he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polonceau 
 that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns chanting matins that hall of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom was the chapel that phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation that bell the sound of which had so strangely surprised him was the bell attached to the knee of father fauchelevent 
 cosette once put to bed jean valjean and fauchelevent had as we have already seen supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good crackling fire then the only bed in the hut being occupied by cosette each threw himself on a truss of straw 
 before he shut his eyes jean valjean said 
 i must remain here henceforth 
 this remark trotted through head all night long 
 to tell the truth neither of them slept 
 jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that javert was on his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to paris 
 then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister 
 jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to remain there 
 now for an unfortunate man in his position this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most dangerous because as no men might enter there if he were discovered it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison the safest because if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there who would ever seek him in such a place to dwell in an impossible place was safety 
 on his side fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains 
 he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter how had m madeleine got there when the walls were what they were cloister walls are not to be stepped over 
 how did he get there with a child 
 one cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in arms 
 who was that child 
 where did they both come from since fauchelevent had lived in the convent he had heard nothing of m sur m and he knew nothing of what had taken place there father madeleine had an air which discouraged questions and besides fauchelevent said to himself 
 one does not question a saint m madeleine had preserved all his prestige in eyes only from some words which jean valjean had let fall the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times and that he was pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some political affair and was in hiding which last did not displease fauchelevent who like many of our peasants of the north had an old fund of bonapartism about him while in hiding m madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there but the inexplicable point to which fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m madeleine should be there and that he should have that little girl with him fauchelevent saw them touched them spoke to them and still did not believe it possible 
 the incomprehensible had just made its entrance into hut 
 fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures and could see nothing clearly but this m madeleine saved my life 
 this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course 
 he said to himself 
 it is my turn now he added in his conscience 
 m madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out 
 he made up his mind to save m madeleine 
 nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies 
 after what he did for me would i save him if he were a thief 
 just the same 
 if he were an assassin would i save him 
 just the same 
 since he is a saint shall i save him just the same 
 but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his his good will and a little of that old rustic cunning on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister and the steep escarpments of the rule of father fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end of his days halt infirm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be performed flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he is dying should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted and should swallow it with avidity we may add that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him 
 so he took his resolve 
 to devote himself to m madeleine 
 we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy 
 that description is just but incomplete 
 at the point of this story which we have now reached a little of father physiology becomes useful 
 he was a peasant but he had been a notary which added trickery to his cunning and penetration to his ingenuousness having through various causes failed in his business he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer 
 but in spite of oaths and lashings which horses seem to require something of the notary had lingered in him 
 he had some natural wit he talked good grammar he conversed which is a rare thing in a village and the other peasants said of him 
 he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat 
 fauchelevent belonged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the of the plebeian 
 rather rustic rather citified pepper and salt fauchelevent though sorely tried and harshly used by fate worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked his defects and his vices for he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer 
 his aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity 
 at daybreak father fauchelevent opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and beheld m madeleine seated on his truss of straw and watching slumbers fauchelevent sat up and said 
 now that you are here how are you going to contrive to enter 
 this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his revery 
 the two men took counsel together 
 in the first place said fauchelevent you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child one step in the garden and we are done for 
 that is true 
 monsieur madeleine resumed fauchelevent you have arrived at a very auspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill 
 this will prevent them from looking much in our direction 
 it seems that she is dying 
 the prayers of the forty hours are being said 
 the whole community is in confusion that occupies them 
 the one who is on the point of departure is a saint 
 in fact we are all saints here all the difference between them and me is that they say our cell and that i say my cabin 
 the prayers for the dying are to be said and then the prayers for the dead 
 we shall be at peace here for but i will not answer for 
 still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible from the convent 
 and i add that the nuns never come near it 
 well said jean valjean 
 the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here 
 it was to this interrogation point that fauchelevent responded 
 there are the little girls 
 what little girls asked jean valjean 
 just as fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a bell emitted one stroke 
 the nun is dead said he 
 there is the knell 
 and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen 
 the bell struck a second time 
 it is the knell monsieur madeleine 
 the bell will continue to strike once a minute for hours until the body is taken from the see they play 
 at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside to send them all hither in spite of prohibitions to hunt and rummage for it all about here those cherubs are devils 
 who asked jean valjean 
 the little girls 
 you would be very quickly discovered they would shriek 
 oh a man 
 there is no danger there will be no recreation hour 
 the day will be entirely devoted to prayers 
 you hear the bell 
 as i told you a stroke each minute it is the death knell 
 i understand father fauchelevent 
 there are pupils 
 and jean valjean thought to himself 
 here is education already provided 
 fauchelevent exclaimed 
 pardine 
 there are little girls indeed 
 and they would bawl around you 
 and they would rush off 
 to be a man here is to have the plague 
 you see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast 
 jean valjean fell into more and more profound convent would be our salvation he murmured 
 then he raised his voice 
 yes the difficulty is to remain here 
 no said fauchelevent the difficulty is to get out 
 jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart 
 to get out 
 yes monsieur madeleine 
 in order to return here it is first necessary to get out 
 and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fauchelevent went on 
 you must not be found here in this fashion 
 whence come you for me you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter by the door 
 all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell 
 ah said fauchelevent they are ringing up the vocal mothers they are going to the chapter 
 they always hold a chapter when any one dies 
 she died at daybreak 
 people generally do die at daybreak but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered 
 come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in 
 jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder 
 you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither jean valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps 
 impossible said he 
 father fauchelevent say that i fell from the sky 
 but i believe it i believe it retorted fauchelevent you have no need to tell me that 
 the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you 
 only he meant to place you in a convent he made a mistake 
 come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the is to come here and view a corpse 
 all that is the ceremony of dying these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit 
 a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything 
 he lifts the veil sometimes he lifts something else too 
 how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time 
 what is the matter 
 your little one is still asleep 
 what is her name 
 cosette 
 she is your daughter 
 you are her grandfather that is 
 yes 
 it will be easy enough for her to get out of here 
 i have my service door which opens on the courtyard 
 i knock 
 the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out father fauchelevent goes out with his is perfectly natural you will tell the child to keep very quiet 
 she will be under the cover i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend a whom i know in the rue who is deaf and who has a little bed 
 i will shout in the ear that she is a niece of mine and that she is to keep her for me until then the little one will with you for i will contrive to have you it must be done but how will you manage to get out 
 jean valjean shook his head 
 no one must see me the whole point lies there father fauchelevent find some means of getting me out in a basket under cover like cosette 
 fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand a sign of serious embarrassment 
 a third peal created a diversion 
 that is the taking his departure said fauchelevent he has taken a look and said 
 she is dead that is well when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the company sends a coffin 
 if it is a mother the mothers lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out 
 after which i nail her up 
 that forms a part of my duty 
 a gardener is a bit of a she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead 
 i count the men and myself as men 
 it is in that hall that i nail up the coffin the men come and get it and whip up coachman the way one goes to heaven 
 they fetch a box with nothing in it they take it away again with something in it 
 what a burial is like 
 de profundis 
 a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light 
 jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her 
 he was no longer listening to fauchelevent 
 that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble 
 the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery 
 they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery 
 it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire 
 it is a shame for it is convenient i have a friend there father mestienne the the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall 
 there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf 
 but how many events have happened since yesterday mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine 
 is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly 
 fauchelevent caught the word 
 goodness if you were here for good it would be a real burial 
 a fourth peal burst out 
 fauchelevent hastily detached the belled from its nail and buckled it on his knee again 
 this time it is for me 
 the mother prioress wants me 
 good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle 
 monsieur madeleine stir from here and wait for me 
 something new has come up if you are hungry there is wine bread and cheese 
 and he hastened out of the hut crying 
 coming coming 
 jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch 
 less than ten minutes later father fauchelevent whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied 
 forever 
 forever that is to say 
 enter 
 the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business 
 this parlor adjoined the chapter hall the prioress seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for fauchelevent

 chapter viii 
 
 count ilya rostov had resigned the position of marshal of the nobility because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs did not improve natasha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral rostov house and estate near moscow it was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal and life at otradnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day these were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the family or persons who were it seemed obliged to live in the house such were dimmler the musician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his family belova an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such as tutors the girls former governess and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the house than at home they had not as many visitors as before but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged there was still the hunting establishment which nicholas had even enlarged the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the games of whist and boston at which spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with count rostov as a most profitable source of income 
 the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and patiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt that her children were being ruined that it was not the fault for he could not help being what he was that though he tried to hide it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position from her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namely for nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to be their last hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right this match was with julie karagina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents a girl the rostovs had known from childhood and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers 
 the countess had written direct to mother in moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and everything depend on her inclination she invited nicholas to come to moscow 
 several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him married she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage 
 at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karagina 
 but mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his 
 no you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to justify herself you have not understood me nikolenka it is your happiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry 
 mamma cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i will give my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i would sacrifice anything for you even my feelings 
 but the countess did not want the question put like that she did not want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him 
 no you have not understood me let us talk about it she replied wiping away her tears 
 maybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma could speak so to me because sonya is poor i must not love her he thought must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainly be happier with her than with some julie i can always sacrifice my feelings for my welfare he said to himself but i coerce my feelings if i love sonya that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else 
 nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the conversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and the portionless sonya though she blamed herself for it she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya often pulling her up without reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using the formal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her the kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sonya because that poor niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful to her benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly in love with nicholas that there were no grounds for finding fault with her 
 nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter had come from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that he would have been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till the beginning of the new year natasha was still as much in love with her betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not master she felt sorry for herself sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to anyone while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved 
 things were not cheerful in the rostovs home

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter ii 
 
 fauchelevent in the presence of a difficulty 
 
 it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions 
 at the moment when fauchelevent entered this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de blemeur mother innocente who was ordinarily cheerful 
 the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell the prioress who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said 
 ah it is you father fauvent 
 this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent 
 fauchelevent bowed again 
 father fauvent i have sent for you 
 here i am reverend mother 
 i have something to say to you 
 and so have i said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror i have something to say to the very reverend mother 
 the prioress stared at him 
 ah you have a communication to make to me 
 a request 
 very well speak 
 goodman fauchelevent the belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance 
 a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent 
 always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity 
 as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those corpses were alive for him he was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute 
 he had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear fauchelevent knew all and concealed all that constituted his art the whole convent thought him stupid 
 a great merit in religion the vocal mothers made much of fauchelevent 
 he was a curious mute he inspired confidence 
 moreover he was regular and never went out except for requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden 
 this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit none the less he had set two men to chattering 
 the porter in the convent and he knew the singularities of their parlor and the at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns one as to their life the other as to their death 
 but he did not abuse his knowledge the congregation thought a great deal of him 
 old lame blind to everything probably a little deaf into the qualities they would have found it difficult to replace him 
 the goodman with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress 
 he talked a long time about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a prioress made a brother no longer second movement on the part of the prioress but one expressive of if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him who might be reared for god in the house and who might who knows become a nun some day 
 when he had finished speaking the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers and said to him 
 could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening 
 for what purpose 
 to serve as a lever 
 yes reverend mother replied fauchelevent 
 the prioress without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled 
 fauchelevent was left alone

 book seven 
 chapter ix 
 
 christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special celebration of the season 
 on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning was asleep on the sofa the old count was resting in his study sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastasya ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies natasha came into the room went up to sonya glanced at what she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking 
 why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother what do you want 
 him i want him now this minute i want him said natasha with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile 
 the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter 
 look at me mamma look i shall cry directly 
 sit down with me a little said the countess 
 mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma 
 her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room 
 she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from the serfs quarters 
 stop playing a time for everything said the old woman 
 let her alone kondratevna said natasha go mavrushka go 
 having released mavrushka natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing cards they broke off and rose as she entered 
 what can i do with them thought natasha 
 oh nikita please go where can i send him yes go to the yard and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some oats 
 just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily 
 go go quickly the old man urged him 
 and you theodore get me a piece of chalk 
 on her way past the pantry she told them to set a samovar though it was not at all the time for tea 
 foka the butler was the most person in the house natasha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted 
 oh dear what a young lady said foka pretending to frown at natasha 
 no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as natasha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no orders so readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought she as she went slowly along the passage 
 nastasya ivanovna what sort of children shall i have she asked the buffoon who was coming toward her in a jacket 
 why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon 
 o lord o lord always the same oh where am i to go what am i to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story 
 two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha sat down listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got up again 
 the island of madagascar she said she repeated articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madame schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room 
 her brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night 
 petya petya she called to him carry me downstairs 
 petya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her arms round his neck and he pranced along with her 
 no the island of madagascar she said and jumping off his back she went downstairs 
 having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natasha betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood for brooding on the past 
 sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before and sonya passing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the same thought natasha 
 sonya what is this she cried twanging a thick string 
 oh you are there said sonya with a start and came near and listened i know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of being wrong 
 there just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before thought natasha and in just the same way i thought there was something lacking in her 
 no the chorus from the listen and natasha sang the air of the chorus so that sonya should catch it where were you going she asked 
 to change the water in this glass i am just finishing the design 
 you always find something to do but i said natasha and nicholas 
 asleep i think 
 sonya go and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come and sing 
 she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with a eyes 
 oh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never be and worst of all i am growing old the thing there then be in me what there is now but perhaps come today will come immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose put down the guitar and went to the drawing room 
 all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already at the tea table the servants stood round the table but prince andrew was not there and life was going on as before 
 ah here she is said the old count when he saw natasha enter well sit down by me but natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something 
 mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs 
 she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the same 
 after tea nicholas sonya and natasha went to the sitting room to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter iii 
 
 mother innocente 
 
 about a quarter of an hour elapsed 
 the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair 
 the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied 
 we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 do you know the chapel 
 i have a little cage there where i hear the mass and the offices 
 and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties 
 two or three times 
 there is a stone to be raised 
 heavy 
 the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar 
 the slab which closes the vault 
 yes 
 it would be a good thing to have two men for it 
 mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you 
 a woman is never a man 
 we have only a woman here to help you 
 each one does what he can because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and i do not despise merlonus horstius 
 neither do i 
 merit consists in working according to strength 
 a cloister is not a 
 and a woman is not a man 
 but my brother is the strong one though 
 and can you get a lever 
 that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door 
 there is a ring in the stone 
 i will put the lever through it 
 and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot 
 that is good reverend mother 
 i will open the vault 
 and the four mother precentors will help you 
 and when the vault is open 
 it must be closed again 
 will that be all 
 no 
 give me your orders very reverend mother 
 fauvent we have confidence in you 
 i am here to do anything you wish 
 and to hold your peace about everything 
 yes reverend mother 
 when the vault is open 
 i will close it again 
 but before that 
 what reverend mother 
 something must be lowered into it 
 a silence ensued 
 the prioress after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation broke it 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 you know that a mother died this morning 
 no 
 did you not hear the bell 
 nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden 
 really 
 i can hardly distinguish my own signal 
 she died at daybreak 
 and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning 
 it was mother crucifixion 
 a blessed woman 
 the prioress paused moved her lips as though in mental prayer and resumed 
 three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer 
 ah yes now i hear the knell reverend mother 
 the mothers have taken her to the which opens on the church 
 i know 
 no other man than you can or must enter that chamber 
 see to that a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the 
 more often 
 hey 
 more often 
 what do you say 
 i say more often 
 more often than what 
 reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often 
 i understand you 
 why do you say more often 
 in order to speak like you reverend mother 
 but i did not say more often 
 at that moment nine struck 
 at nine in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress 
 amen said fauchelevent 
 the clock struck opportunely 
 it cut more often short it is probable that had it not been for this the prioress and fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein 
 fauchelevent mopped his forehead 
 the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice 
 in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles 
 she will replied father fauchelevent falling into step and striving not to flinch again 
 father fauvent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion no doubt it is not granted to every one to die like cardinal de berulle while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to god while pronouncing these words 
 hanc igitur oblationem but without attaining to such happiness mother death was very precious 
 she retained her consciousness to the very last moment 
 she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels she gave us her last commands 
 if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it 
 she smiled 
 we felt that she was regaining her life in god 
 there was something of paradise in that death 
 fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing 
 amen said he 
 father fauvent what the dead wish must be done 
 the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet 
 fauchelevent held his peace 
 she went on 
 i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit 
 reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden 
 besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint 
 like yourself reverend mother 
 she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii 
 the one who crowned the 
 for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it 
 she continued 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 saint didorus archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb 
 acarus which signifies a worm of the earth this was done 
 is this true 
 yes reverend mother 
 the blessed mezzocane abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done 
 that is true 
 saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that would spit on his tomb 
 this was done the dead must be obeyed 
 so be it 
 the body of bernard guidonis born in france near was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain 
 can the contrary be affirmed 
 for that matter no reverend mother 
 the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse 
 several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence the prioress resumed 
 father fauvent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years 
 that is just 
 it is a continuation of her slumber 
 so i shall have to nail up that coffin 
 yes 
 and we are to reject the coffin 
 precisely 
 i am at the orders of the very reverend community 
 the four mother precentors will assist you 
 in nailing up the coffin 
 i do not need them 
 no in lowering the coffin 
 where 
 into the vault 
 what vault 
 under the altar 
 fauchelevent started 
 the vault under the altar 
 under the altar 
 but 
 you will have an iron bar 
 yes but 
 you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring 
 but 
 the dead must be obeyed 
 to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion 
 she asked it of us that is to say commanded us 
 but it is forbidden 
 forbidden by men enjoined by god 
 what if it became known 
 we have confidence in you 
 oh 
 i am a stone in your walls 
 the chapter assembled 
 the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our altar 
 think father fauvent if she were to work miracles here 
 what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs 
 but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission 
 saint benoit ii in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine pogonatus 
 but the commissary of police 
 chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar 
 but the inspector from the prefecture 
 the world is nothing in the presence of the cross 
 martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dum volvitur orbis 
 amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin 
 any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long on the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it 
 the prioress who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away 
 i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard 
 who was bernard the first abbot of clairvaux 
 fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth 
 his father was named tecelin and his mother alethe 
 he began at citeaux to end in clairvaux he was ordained abbot by the bishop of guillaume de champeaux he had seven hundred novices and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries he overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in and pierre de bruys and henry his disciple and another sort of erring spirits who were called the apostolics he confounded arnauld de brescia darted lightning at the monk raoul the murderer of the jews dominated the council of reims in caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea bishop of poitiers caused the condemnation of eon de arranged the disputes of princes enlightened king louis the young advised pope eugene iii regulated the temple preached the crusade performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many as in one day 
 who was benoit 
 he was the patriarch of he was the second founder of the saintete claustrale he was the basil of the west 
 his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses kings queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years 
 on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public ways the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that there is not a chance who would not be indignant to see how we are treated 
 we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ 
 your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age silence fauvent 
 fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath the prioress continued 
 no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture 
 only fanatics and those in error deny it 
 we live in times of terrible confusion we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore 
 we are ignorant and impious 
 in this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi to the cross of jesus christ 
 louis xvi 
 was merely a king let us beware of god 
 there is no longer just nor unjust the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar de bus nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory 
 the last the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de gondren succeeded to berulle and francois bourgoin to gondren and senault to bourgoin and father to senault the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie but because he furnished henri iv the huguenot king with the material for an oath that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play 
 and then religion is attacked why 
 because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed mommol 
 what has that to do with the question 
 does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar 
 they persecute the saints 
 they shut their eyes to the truth 
 darkness is the rule 
 the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind no one thinks of hell as a reality 
 oh how wicked people are by order of the king signifies by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead 
 a holy death is prohibited 
 burial is a civil matter 
 this is horrible saint leo ii 
 wrote two special letters one to pierre notaire the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the emperor 
 gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy the ancient magistracy agreed with him 
 in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day 
 the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy 
 we do what we please with our dead is not the body of saint benoit himself in france in the abbey of fleury called saint although he died in italy at on saturday the st of the month of march of the year 
 all this is incontestable 
 i abhor i hate priors i execrate heretics but i should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary 
 one has only to read arnoul wion gabriel bucelin trithemus maurolics and dom luc 
 the prioress took breath then turned to fauchelevent 
 is it settled father fauvent 
 it is settled reverend mother 
 we may depend on you 
 i will obey 
 that is well 
 i am entirely devoted to the convent 
 that is understood 
 you will close the coffin 
 the sisters will carry it to the chapel 
 the office for the dead will then be said then we shall return to the cloister 
 between eleven and midnight you will come with your iron bar 
 all will be done in the most profound secrecy 
 there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors mother ascension and yourself 
 and the sister at the post 
 she will not turn round 
 but she will hear 
 she will not listen 
 besides what the cloister knows the world learns not 
 a pause ensued 
 the prioress went on 
 you will remove your bell 
 it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence 
 reverend mother 
 what father fauvent 
 has the doctor for the dead paid his visit 
 he will pay it at four the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung but you do not understand any of the peals 
 i pay no attention to any but my own 
 that is well father fauvent 
 reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required 
 where will you obtain it 
 where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden 
 about of an hour before midnight do not forget 
 reverend mother 
 what 
 if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you 
 a perfect turk 
 you will do it as speedily as possible 
 i cannot work very fast 
 i am infirm that is why i require an assistant 
 i limp 
 to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing 
 the emperor henry ii who combated antipope gregory and benoit viii has two surnames the saint and the lame 
 two surtouts are a good thing murmured fauchelevent who really was a little hard of hearing 
 now that i think of it father fauvent let us give a whole hour to it 
 that is not too much 
 be near the principal altar with your iron bar at eleven the office begins at midnight everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that 
 i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders 
 i am to nail up the coffin 
 at eleven exactly i am to be in the chapel 
 the mother precentors will be there 
 mother ascension will be there 
 two men would be better 
 however never mind 
 i shall have my lever we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again 
 after which there will be no trace of anything the government will have no suspicion 
 thus all has been arranged reverend mother 
 no 
 what else remains 
 the empty coffin remains 
 this produced a pause 
 fauchelevent meditated 
 the prioress meditated 
 what is to be done with that coffin father fauvent 
 it will be given to the earth 
 empty 
 another silence 
 fauchelevent made with his left hand that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject 
 reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church and no one can enter there but myself and i will cover the coffin with the pall 
 yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it 
 ah the de exclaimed fauchelevent 
 the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener 
 the vil stuck fast in his throat 
 he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath 
 i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother 
 that will produce the effect of a corpse 
 you are right 
 earth that is the same thing as man 
 so you will manage the empty coffin 
 i will make that my special business 
 the face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene once more 
 she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him 
 fauchelevent went towards the door 
 as he was on the point of passing out the prioress raised her voice gently 
 i am pleased with you father fauvent bring your brother to me after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter

 book seven 
 chapter x 
 
 does it ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when they settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing that everything good is past and to feel not exactly dull but sad 
 i should think so he replied i have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music and suddenly i felt so depressed 
 oh yes i know i know i know natasha interrupted him when i was quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i was punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbing in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocent that was the chief thing said natasha do you remember 
 i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you do you remember 
 and do you remember natasha asked with a pensive smile how once long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into the study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and suddenly there stood 
 a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course i remember even now i know whether there really was a negro or if we only dreamed it or were told about him 
 he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at us 
 sonya do you remember asked nicholas 
 yes yes i do remember something too sonya answered timidly 
 you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natasha and they say there was no negro at all but you see you remember 
 of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them 
 how strange it is as if it were a dream i like that 
 and do you remember how we rolled eggs in the ballroom and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that real or not do you remember what fun it was 
 yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch 
 so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those impressions of most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they laughed with quiet enjoyment 
 sonya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared the same reminiscences 
 much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it 
 she only really took part when they recalled first arrival she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with cords 
 and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage said natasha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable 
 while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room 
 they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper 
 it wanted petya tell them to take it away replied natasha 
 in the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its cloth covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound 
 mr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the old countess voice from the drawing room 
 dimmler struck a chord and turning to natasha nicholas and sonya remarked how quiet you young people are 
 yes philosophizing said natasha glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreams 
 dimmler began to play natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else 
 do you know said natasha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and sonya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world 
 that is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well and remembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals and will go back into animals again 
 no i believe we ever were in animals said natasha still in a whisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that we were angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we remember 
 may i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down by them 
 if we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas no that be 
 not lower who said we were lower how do i know what i was before natasha rejoined with conviction the soul is immortal well then if i shall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole eternity 
 yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they 
 why is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now today and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the day before 
 natasha now your turn sing me something they heard the countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators 
 mamma i at all want to replied natasha but all the same she rose 
 none of them not even the dimmler wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best natasha began to sing her favorite song 
 she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the count from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her and like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sonya as she listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she thought of natasha and of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and prince andrew 
 dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with closed eyes 
 ah countess he said at last a european talent she has nothing to learn what softness tenderness and strength 
 ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess not realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that natasha had too much of something and that because of this she would not be happy before natasha had finished singing petya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived 
 natasha stopped abruptly 
 idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time 
 nothing mamma really nothing only petya startled me she said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her 
 the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks innkeepers and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had disappeared 
 half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas a turkish girl was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and a circassian was sonya with mustache and eyebrows 
 after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere 
 nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to 
 no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides you have room to turn round there if you must go go to the melyukovs 
 melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and governesses lived three miles from the rostovs 
 right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused dress up at once and go with them make pashette open her eyes 
 but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if louisa ivanovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies might go to the melyukovs sonya generally so timid and shy more urgently than anyone begging louisa ivanovna not to refuse 
 costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa ivanovna consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow drove up to the porch 
 natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing from one to another grew stronger and stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to one another laughing and shouting 
 two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the old with a trotter from the orlov stud as shaft horse the fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse nicholas in his old dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand 
 it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof 
 natasha sonya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas sleigh dimmler his wife and petya into the old and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs 
 you go ahead zakhar shouted nicholas to his coachman wishing for a chance to race past him 
 the old troyka with dimmler and his party started forward squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar and threw it up 
 nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after the other 
 a track a lot of tracks rang out voice through the air 
 how light it is nicholas came voice 
 nicholas glanced round at sonya and bent down to see her face closer quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the moonlight 
 that used to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer and smiled 
 what is it nicholas 
 nothing said he and turned again to the horses 
 when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners and cut up by hoofs the marks of which were visible in the moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from side to side moving his ears as if asking it time to begin now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the shouts laughter and voices of the mummers 
 gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip 
 it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required 
 nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river 
 where are we thought he the kosoy meadow i suppose but no this is something new never seen before this the kosoy meadow nor the demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is it is something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh 
 zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows 
 nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his arms clucked his tongue and let his horses go 
 now look out master he cried 
 faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead zakhar while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins 
 no you master he shouted 
 nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides 
 again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars 
 zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is this melyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is and he looked round in the sleigh 
 look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the strange pretty unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and mustache 
 i think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was madame schoss but perhaps not and this circassian with the mustache i know but i love her 
 you cold he asked 
 they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something probably something funny but they could not make out what he said 
 yes yes some voices answered laughing 
 but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to melyukovka thought nicholas 
 it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came running out to the porch carrying candles 
 who is it asked someone in the porch 
 the mummers from the i know by the horses replied some voices

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter iv 
 
 in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castillejo 
 
 the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a man they do not reach their goal very promptly 
 moreover fauchelevent was in a dilemma 
 he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden 
 cosette had waked up 
 jean valjean had placed her near the fire 
 at the moment when fauchelevent entered jean valjean was pointing out to her the basket on the wall and saying to her listen attentively to me my little cosette we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here 
 the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that 
 you will wait for me at a house i shall come to fetch you 
 obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame thenardier to get you again 
 cosette nodded gravely 
 jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the door 
 well 
 everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out 
 where the difficulty lies 
 it is easy enough with the child 
 you will carry her out 
 and she will hold her tongue 
 i answer for that 
 but you father madeleine 
 and after a silence fraught with anxiety fauchelevent exclaimed 
 why get out as you came in 
 jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible 
 fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean 
 there is another thing which bothers me 
 i have said that i would put earth in it 
 when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing it do it will get displaced it will move about 
 the men will bear it you understand father madeleine the government will notice it 
 jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving 
 fauchelevent went on 
 how the are you going to get out 
 it must all be done by morning 
 it is that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you 
 then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he nailed up the coffins and helped the at the cemetery that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel 
 that the police regulations forbade this but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased 
 that it was so much the worse for the government that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault and that by way of thanks the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil 
 that his brother was m madeleine and that his niece was cosette 
 that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery 
 but that he could not bring m madeleine in from the outside if m madeleine was not outside that that was the first problem 
 and then that there was another the empty coffin 
 what is that empty coffin asked jean valjean 
 fauchelevent replied 
 the coffin of the administration 
 what coffin 
 what administration 
 a nun dies 
 the municipal doctor comes and says a nun has died the government sends a coffin 
 the next day it sends a hearse and men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery the men will come and lift the coffin there will be nothing in it 
 put something in it 
 a corpse 
 i have none 
 no 
 what then 
 a living person 
 what person 
 me said jean valjean 
 fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair 
 you 
 why not 
 jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter 
 you know fauchelevent what you have said 
 mother crucifixion is dead 
 and i add 
 and father madeleine is buried 
 ah good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously 
 very seriously i must get out of this place 
 certainly 
 l have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also 
 well 
 the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth 
 in the first place it will be a white cloth 
 nuns are buried in white 
 let it be a white cloth then 
 you are not like other men father madeleine 
 to behold such devices which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent caused fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the rue would inspire in a 
 jean valjean went on 
 the problem is to get out of here without being seen 
 this offers the means 
 but give me some information in the first place how is it managed 
 where is this coffin 
 the empty one 
 yes 
 down stairs in what is called the it stands on two trestles under the pall 
 how long is the coffin 
 six feet 
 what is this 
 it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church 
 what church 
 the church in the street the church which any one can enter 
 have you the keys to those two doors 
 no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church 
 when does the porter open that door 
 only to allow the men to enter when they come to get the coffin 
 when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again 
 who nails up the coffin 
 i do 
 who spreads the pall over it 
 i do 
 are you alone 
 not another man except the police doctor can enter the that is even written on the wall 
 could you hide me in that room when every one is asleep 
 no but i could hide you in a small dark nook which opens on the where i keep my tools to use for burials and of which i have the key 
 at what time will the hearse come for the coffin 
 about three in the afternoon 
 the burial will take place at the vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall it is not very near 
 i will remain concealed in your all night and all the morning 
 and how about food 
 i shall be hungry 
 i will bring you something 
 you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two 
 fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his 
 but that is impossible 
 bah 
 impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank 
 what seemed unprecedented to fauchelevent was we repeat a simple matter to jean valjean 
 jean valjean had been in worse straits than this 
 any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him 
 an escape is a cure what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure 
 to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean gloomy talents 
 moreover a coffin containing a living expedient is also an imperial expedient 
 if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication 
 he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of in this manner 
 fauchelevent who had recovered himself a little exclaimed 
 but how will you manage to breathe 
 i will breathe 
 in that box 
 the mere thought of it suffocates me 
 you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely 
 good 
 and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze 
 a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze 
 and jean valjean added 
 father fauchelevent we must come to a decision 
 i must either be caught here or accept this escape through the hearse 
 every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a door 
 who is there who has not said to a cat do come in 
 there are men who when an incident stands before them have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate the cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious 
 fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature 
 but jean coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself 
 he grumbled 
 well since there is no other means 
 jean valjean resumed 
 the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery 
 that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed fauchelevent if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave 
 the is a drunkard and a friend of mine 
 he is father mestienne 
 an old fellow of the old school 
 the puts the corpses in the grave and i put the in my pocket 
 i will tell you what will take place 
 they will arrive a little before dusk of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed the hearse will drive directly up to the grave 
 i shall follow that is my business 
 i shall have a hammer a chisel and some pincers in my pocket 
 the hearse halts the men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down 
 the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure 
 i am left alone with father mestienne he is my friend i tell you 
 one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober 
 if he is not drunk i shall say to him 
 come and drink a bout while the bon coing the good quince is open 
 i carry him off i get him drunk it does not take long to make father mestienne drunk he always has the beginning of it about lay him under the table i take his card so that i can get into the cemetery again and i return without him 
 then you have no longer any one but me to deal with 
 if he is drunk i shall say to him 
 be off i will do your work for you 
 off he goes and i drag you out of the hole 
 jean valjean held out his hand and fauchelevent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant 
 that is settled father fauchelevent 
 all will go well 
 provided nothing goes wrong thought fauchelevent 
 in that case it would be terrible

 book seven 
 chapter xi 
 
 pelageya danilovna melyukova a broadly built energetic woman wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule 
 hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the clown dimmler and the lady nicholas started a dance surrounded by the screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room 
 dear me no recognizing them and natasha see whom she looks like she really reminds me of somebody but herr dimmler he good i know him and how he dances dear me a circassian really how becoming it is to dear sonya and who is that well you have cheered us up nikita and vanya clear away the tables and we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar just like a boy and the legs i look at him different voices were saying 
 natasha the young melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from behind the door ten minutes later all the young melyukovs joined the mummers 
 pelageya danilovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them it was not merely dimmler and the rostovs she failed to recognize she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on 
 and who is is this she asked her governess peering into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a i suppose it is one of the rostovs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve in she asked natasha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk she ordered the butler who was handing things round not forbidden by his law 
 sometimes as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers who having decided once for all that being disguised no one would recognize them were not at all shy pelageya danilovna hid her face in her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible kindly elderly laughter 
 my little sasha look at sasha she said 
 after russian country dances and chorus dances pelageya danilovna made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together 
 in an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed and merry faces pelageya danilovna began to recognize the mummers admired their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they suited the young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom 
 now to tell fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening said an old maid who lived with the melyukovs during supper 
 why said the eldest melyukov girl 
 you go it takes courage 
 go said sonya 
 tell what happened to the young lady said the second melyukov girl 
 well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a cock laid the table for two all properly and sat down after sitting a while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a man like an officer comes in and sits down to table with her 
 ah ah screamed natasha rolling her eyes with horror 
 yes and how did he speak 
 yes like a man everything quite all right and he began persuading her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then he caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then 
 now why frighten them said pelageya danilovna 
 mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter 
 and how does one do it in a barn inquired sonya 
 well say you went to the barn now and listened it depends on what you hear hammering and knocking bad but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that too 
 mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn 
 pelageya danilovna smiled 
 oh forgotten she replied but none of you would go 
 yes i will pelageya danilovna let me go said sonya 
 well why not if not afraid 
 louisa ivanovna may i asked sonya 
 whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now nicholas did not leave side and gazed at her with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks to that mustache that he had fully learned to know her and really that evening sonya was brighter more animated and prettier than nicholas had ever seen her before 
 so what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before 
 not afraid of anything said sonya may i go at once she got up 
 they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head and shoulders and glanced at nicholas 
 what a darling that girl is thought he and what have i been thinking of till now 
 sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went hastily to the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people really had made the house stuffy 
 outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even brighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth was gay 
 i am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought nicholas and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch he knew sonya would pass that way halfway lay some piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log walls of the barn and its roof that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snapped with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness 
 from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the path miss only look back 
 i am not afraid answered voice and along the path toward nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of feet in her thin shoes 
 sonya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had known and always slightly feared he was in a dress with tousled hair and a happy smile new to sonya she ran rapidly toward him 
 quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sonya kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks 
 sonya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and then back again he by the front and she by the back porch

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter v 
 
 it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal 
 
 on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an hearse ornamented with skulls and tears this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms a in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed 
 two men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse 
 behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along 
 the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery 
 the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible protruding from the pocket 
 the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris 
 it had its peculiar usages just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door which old people in the quarter who clung tenaciously to ancient words still called the porte cavaliere and the porte pietonne the of the rue had obtained permission as we have already stated to be buried there in a corner apart and at night the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community 
 the being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest 
 the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect perronet and inhabited by the of the cemetery 
 these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides 
 if any were delayed after that moment in the cemetery there was but one way for him to get out his card furnished by the department of public funerals a sort of was constructed in the window the dropped his card into this box the porter heard it fall pulled the rope and the small door opened 
 if the man had not his card he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs 
 
 instead of porte cochere and porte batarde 
 
 this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration 
 it was suppressed a little later than 
 the cemetery of called the eastern cemetery succeeded to it and inherited that famous next to the vaugirard cemetery which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board and which formed an angle one side on the drinkers tables and the other on the tombs with this sign au bon coing 
 the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery it was falling into disuse 
 dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it 
 the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard it hinted at poverty 
 if you please to be buried in is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany 
 it is recognized as elegant 
 the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an french garden 
 straight alleys box holly ancient tombs beneath aged and very tall grass in the evening it was tragic there 
 there were very lugubrious lines about it 
 the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery the lame man who followed it was no other than fauchelevent 
 the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch 
 let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight 
 it is one of the faults which resemble a duty the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences 
 in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable 
 in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see 
 make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves 
 the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle 
 fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind 
 his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent the other against it the other with m madeleine had succeeded to all appearance 
 jean composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success 
 what remained to be done was a mere nothing 
 within the last two years he had made good father mestienne a person drunk at least ten times 
 he played with father mestienne 
 he did what he liked with him 
 he made him dance according to his whim head adjusted itself to the cap of will confidence was perfect 
 at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse and said half aloud as he rubbed his big hands 
 a fine farce 
 all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate 
 the permission for interment must be exhibited 
 the man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery 
 during this colloquy which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes some one a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside fauchelevent 
 he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm 
 fauchelevent surveyed this stranger 
 who are you he demanded 
 the man replied 
 the 
 if a man could survive the blow of a full in the breast he would make the same face that fauchelevent made 
 the 
 yes 
 you 
 i 
 father mestienne is the 
 he was 
 what 
 he was 
 he is dead 
 fauchelevent had expected anything but this that a could die 
 it is true nevertheless that do die themselves 
 by dint of excavating graves for other people one hollows out own 
 fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open 
 he had hardly the strength to stammer 
 but it is not possible 
 it is so 
 but he persisted feebly father mestienne is the 
 after napoleon louis xviii 
 after mestienne gribier peasant my name is gribier 
 fauchelevent who was deadly pale stared at this gribier 
 he was a tall thin livid utterly funereal man 
 he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned 
 fauchelevent burst out laughing 
 ah said he what queer things do happen 
 father mestienne is dead but long live little father lenoir 
 do you know who little father lenoir is 
 he is a jug of red wine 
 it is a jug of surene morbigou of real paris surene 
 ah 
 so old mestienne is dead i am sorry for it he was a jolly fellow 
 but you are a jolly fellow too 
 are you not comrade 
 go and have a drink together presently 
 the man replied 
 i have been a student 
 i passed my fourth examination i never drink 
 the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery 
 fauchelevent had slackened his pace 
 he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity 
 the walked on in front of him 
 fauchelevent passed the unexpected gribier once more in review 
 he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and who though slender are extremely strong 
 comrade cried fauchelevent 
 the man turned round 
 i am the convent 
 my colleague said the man 
 fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered 
 so father mestienne is dead 
 the man replied 
 completely 
 the good god consulted his which shows when the time is up 
 it was father turn 
 father mestienne died 
 fauchelevent repeated mechanically 
 the good god 
 the good god said the man authoritatively 
 according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being 
 shall we not make each acquaintance stammered fauchelevent 
 it is made 
 you are a peasant i am a parisian 
 people do not know each other until they have drunk together he who empties his glass empties his heart 
 you must come and have a drink with me 
 such a thing cannot be refused 
 business first 
 fauchelevent thought 
 i am lost 
 they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner 
 the resumed 
 peasant i have seven small children who must be fed 
 as they must eat i cannot drink 
 and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well 
 their hunger is the enemy of my thirst 
 the hearse skirted a clump of quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the waste land and plunged into a thicket 
 this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture 
 fauchelevent slackened his pace but he could not detain the hearse 
 fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed 
 he approached the 
 they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured fauchelevent 
 villager retorted the man i ought not be a my father was a porter at the prytaneum he destined me for literature 
 but he had reverses 
 he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author 
 but i am still a public writer 
 so you are not a then returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was 
 the one does not hinder the other 
 i cumulate 
 fauchelevent did not understand this last word 
 come have a drink said he 
 here a remark becomes necessary 
 fauchelevent whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay 
 generally fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new and it was necessary to make this offer but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark and that not unintentionally as for himself fauchelevent did not wish to pay troubled as he was 
 the went on with a superior smile 
 one must eat 
 i have accepted father reversion one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes 
 to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm i have my stall in the market of the rue de sevres you know the umbrella market 
 all the cooks of the red cross apply to me 
 i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers in the morning i write love letters in the evening i dig graves such is life rustic 
 the hearse was still advancing 
 fauchelevent uneasy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides 
 great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow 
 but continued the a man cannot serve two mistresses i must choose between the pen and the mattock 
 the mattock is ruining my hand 
 the hearse halted 
 the choir boy alighted from the then the priest 
 one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible 
 what a farce this is repeated fauchelevent in consternation

 chapter xii 
 
 when they all drove back from pelageya natasha who always saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss should go back in the sleigh with dimmler and sonya with nicholas and the maids 
 on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic light into face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sonya and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in fairyland 
 sonya is it well with thee he asked from time to time 
 yes she replied and with thee 
 when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a moment to sleigh and stood on its wing 
 natasha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mind about sonya 
 have you told her asked natasha suddenly beaming all over with joy 
 oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows natasha are you glad 
 i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did not tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while sonya was not continued natasha now i am so glad well run back to her 
 no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natasha magical it 
 yes she replied you have done splendidly 
 had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and all would have been well 
 so you are glad and i have done right 
 oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of sonya for there is nothing but good in her 
 then all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expression of his face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassian was sonya and that sonya was certainly his future happy and loving wife 
 when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom when they had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how happy they would be on table stood two looking glasses which dunyasha had prepared beforehand 
 only when will all that be i am afraid never it would be too good said natasha rising and going to the looking glasses 
 sit down natasha perhaps see him said sonya 
 natasha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking glasses and sat down 
 i see someone with a mustache said natasha seeing her own face 
 you laugh miss said dunyasha 
 with help and the natasha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from tales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in that last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses 
 why is it others see things and i she said you sit down now sonya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel so frightened 
 sonya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began looking 
 now miss sonya is sure to see something whispered dunyasha while you do nothing but laugh 
 sonya heard this and whisper 
 i know she will she saw something last year 
 for about three minutes all were silent 
 of course she will whispered natasha but did not finish suddenly sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her hand 
 oh natasha she cried 
 did you see did you what was it exclaimed natasha holding up the looking glass 
 sonya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard natasha say of course she will she did not wish to disappoint either dunyasha or natasha but it was hard to sit still she did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes 
 you saw him urged natasha seizing her hand 
 yes wait a bit i saw him sonya could not help saying not yet knowing whom natasha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew 
 but why i say i saw something others do see besides who can tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through mind 
 yes i saw him she said 
 how standing or lying 
 no i saw at first there was nothing then i saw him lying down 
 andrew lying is he ill asked natasha her frightened eyes fixed on her friend 
 no on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and he turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen what she described 
 well and then sonya 
 after that i could not make out what there was something blue and red 
 sonya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how afraid i am for him and for myself and about everything natasha began and without replying to words of comfort she got into bed and long after her candle was out lay and motionless gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes

 chapter vi 
 
 between four planks 
 who was in the coffin 
 the reader knows 
 jean valjean 
 jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he could almost breathe 
 it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest 
 every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing and progressing favorably since the preceding day 
 he like fauchelevent counted on father mestienne 
 he had no doubt as to the end 
 never was there a more critical situation never more complete composure 
 the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace it seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean tranquillity 
 from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had followed all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death 
 shortly after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank jean valjean had felt himself carried out then driven off 
 he knew from the diminution in the jolting when they left the pavements and reached the earth road 
 he had divined from a dull noise that they were crossing the bridge of austerlitz 
 at the first halt he had understood that they were entering the cemetery at the second halt he said to himself 
 here is the grave 
 suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin then a harsh grating against the planks he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity 
 then he experienced a giddiness 
 the man and the had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance and had lowered the head before the foot 
 he recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless 
 he had just touched the bottom 
 he had a certain sensation of cold 
 a voice rose above him glacial and solemn 
 he heard latin words which he did not understand pass over him so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one 
 qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere evigilabunt alii in vitam aeternam et alii in approbrium ut videant semper 
 a voice said 
 de profundis 
 the grave voice began again 
 requiem aeternam dona ei domine 
 the voice responded 
 et lux perpetua luceat ei 
 he heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him 
 it was probably the holy water 
 he thought 
 this will be over soon now 
 patience for a little while longer 
 the priest will take his departure fauchelevent will take mestienne off to drink 
 i shall be left then fauchelevent will return alone and i shall get out that will be the work of a good hour 
 the grave voice resumed 
 requiescat in pace 
 and the voice said 
 amen 
 jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating footsteps 
 there they are going now thought he 
 i am alone 
 all at once he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder 
 it was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin 
 a second shovelful fell 
 one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up 
 a third shovelful of earth fell 
 then a fourth 
 there are things which are too strong for the strongest man jean valjean lost consciousness

 book seven 
 chapter xiii 
 
 soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love for sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage nicholas for the first time felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her love for him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son she sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts in her presence but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room the old count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and his father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and went in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sonya on this occasion he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder no better wife for nicholas than sonya could have been wished for and that no one but himself with his mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances 
 the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again but a few days later the countess sent for sonya and with a cruelty neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch nicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could not help loving the countess and the whole rostov family but neither could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love she was silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he first implored her to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriage then he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry her secretly 
 the countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without his consent and he could do the same but that she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter 
 exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it for natasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at which she had been listening 
 nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice 
 mamma darling not at all so my poor sweet darling she said to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way 
 nicholas explain to you go away listen mamma darling said natasha 
 her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she was aiming 
 the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her breast while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room 
 natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should not be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents knowledge 
 firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment to retire from the army and return and marry sonya nicholas serious sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him passionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his regiment 
 after nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were more depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation 
 sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs which called for some decisive action their town house and estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day 
 natasha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every day the thought that her best days which she would have employed in loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone tormented her incessantly his letters for the most part irritated her it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he was living a real life seeing new places and new people that interested him the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt her letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile and glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling 
 there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrew was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending the winter and natasha felt sure he had already arrived 
 so the countess remained in the country and the count taking sonya and natasha with him went to moscow at the end of january

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter vii 
 
 in which will be found the origin of the saying 
 lose the card 
 this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean 
 when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure fauchelevent who had not taken his eyes from the saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt 
 then fauchelevent took a supreme resolve 
 he placed himself between the grave and the crossed his arms and said 
 i am the one to pay 
 the stared at him in amazement and replied 
 that peasant 
 fauchelevent repeated 
 i am the one who pays 
 what 
 for the wine 
 what wine 
 that argenteuil wine 
 where is the argenteuil 
 at the bon coing 
 go to the devil said the 
 and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin 
 the coffin gave back a hollow sound 
 fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle 
 comrade 
 before the bon coing is shut 
 the took some more earth on his shovel fauchelevent continued 
 i will pay 
 and he seized the arm 
 listen to me comrade 
 i am the convent i have come to help you 
 it is a business which can be performed at night let us begin then by going for a drink 
 and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy reflection occurred to him 
 and if he drinks will he get drunk 
 provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i consent 
 we will drink 
 after work never before 
 and he flourished his shovel briskly 
 fauchelevent held him back 
 it is argenteuil wine at six 
 oh come said the you are a ding dong ding dong all you know how to say 
 go hang yourself 
 and he threw in a second shovelful 
 fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying 
 come along and drink he cried since it is i who pays the bill 
 when we have put the child to bed said the 
 he flung in a third shovelful 
 then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added 
 cold you see and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet 
 at that moment as he loaded his shovel the bent over and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped 
 wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket and there it stopped 
 the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket 
 the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traversed pupils 
 an idea had just occurred to him 
 he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it 
 the man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave 
 just as he turned round to get the fifth fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said 
 by the way you new man have you your card 
 the paused 
 what card 
 the sun is on the point of setting 
 good it is going to put on its nightcap 
 the gate of the cemetery will close immediately 
 well what then 
 have you your card 
 ah my card said the 
 and he fumbled in his pocket 
 having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other he passed on to his fobs explored the first returned to the second 
 why no said he i have not my card 
 i must have forgotten it 
 fifteen francs fine said fauchelevent 
 the turned green 
 green is the pallor of livid people 
 ah 
 he exclaimed fifteen francs fine 
 
 with the moon 
 
 three pieces of a hundred sous said fauchelevent 
 the dropped his shovel 
 turn had come 
 ah come now conscript said fauchelevent none of this despair there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave fifteen francs is fifteen francs and besides you may not be able to pay it 
 i am an old hand you are a new one 
 i know all the ropes and the devices 
 i will give you some friendly advice one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the dome now the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more 
 that is true replied the man 
 five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is as hollow as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut 
 that is true 
 in that case a fine of fifteen francs 
 fifteen francs 
 but you have time 
 where do you live 
 a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here no rue de vaugirard 
 you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed 
 that is exactly so 
 once outside the gate you gallop home you get your card you return the cemetery porter admits you 
 as you have your card there will be nothing to pay 
 and you will bury your corpse watch it for you in the meantime so that it shall not run away 
 i am indebted to you for my life peasant 
 decamp said fauchelevent 
 the overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set off on a run 
 when the man had disappeared in the thicket fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the grave and said in a low tone 
 father madeleine 
 there was no reply 
 fauchelevent was seized with a shudder 
 he tumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried 
 are you there 
 silence in the coffin 
 fauchelevent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pried up the coffin lid 
 jean face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes were closed 
 hair rose upright on his head he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the coffin 
 he stared at jean valjean 
 jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless 
 fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh 
 he is dead 
 and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders he cried 
 and this is the way i save his life 
 then the poor man fell to sobbing 
 he soliloquized the while for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural powerful emotion often talks aloud 
 it is father fault 
 why did that fool die 
 what need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it 
 it is he who has killed m madeleine father madeleine 
 he is in the coffin 
 it is quite handy all is over 
 now is there any sense in these things ah my god he is dead 
 well and his little girl what am i to do with her 
 what will the say 
 the idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this when i think how he put himself under that cart 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 pardine 
 he was suffocated i said so he believe me 
 well 
 a pretty trick to play he is dead that good man the very best man out of all the good good folks 
 and his little girl 
 ah 
 in the first place i go back there myself 
 i shall stay here 
 after having done such a thing as that 
 the use of being two old men if we are two old fools 
 but in the first place how did he manage to enter the convent 
 that was the beginning of it all one should not do such things 
 father madeleine 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 madeleine 
 monsieur madeleine 
 monsieur le maire he does not hear me 
 now get out of this scrape if you can 
 and he tore his hair 
 a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance it was the cemetery gate closing 
 fauchelevent bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit 
 jean eyes were open and gazing at him 
 to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much so 
 fauchelevent became like stone pale haggard overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at him 
 i fell asleep said jean valjean 
 and he raised himself to a sitting posture 
 fauchelevent fell on his knees 
 just good virgin 
 how you frightened me 
 then he sprang to his feet and cried 
 thanks father madeleine 
 jean valjean had merely fainted 
 the fresh air had revived him 
 joy is the ebb of terror 
 fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had 
 so you are not dead 
 oh 
 how wise you are 
 i called you so much that you came back 
 when i saw your eyes shut i said good there he is stifled i should have gone raving mad mad enough for a strait jacket 
 they would have put me in bicetre what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead and your little girl 
 that would never have understood it 
 the child is thrust into your arms and then the grandfather is dead 
 what a story good saints of paradise what a tale 
 ah you are alive the best of it 
 i am cold said jean valjean 
 this remark recalled fauchelevent thoroughly to reality and there was pressing need of it 
 the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place 
 let us get out of here quickly exclaimed fauchelevent 
 he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself 
 but first take a drop said he 
 the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties 
 he got out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid again 
 three minutes later they were out of the grave 
 moreover fauchelevent was perfectly composed 
 he took his time the cemetery was closed 
 the arrival of the gribier was not to be apprehended 
 that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings since it was in pocket without a card he could not get back into the cemetery 
 fauchelevent took the shovel and jean valjean the and together they buried the empty coffin 
 when the grave was full fauchelevent said to jean valjean 
 let us go 
 i will keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock 
 night was falling 
 jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse 
 the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks 
 he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb 
 you are benumbed said fauchelevent 
 it is a pity that i have a game leg for otherwise we might step out briskly 
 bah replied jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once more 
 they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed on arriving before the closed gate and the pavilion fauchelevent who held the card in his hand dropped it into the box the porter pulled the rope the gate opened and they went out 
 how well everything is going said fauchelevent what a capital idea that was of yours father madeleine 
 they passed the vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two passports 
 the rue vaugirard was deserted 
 father madeleine said fauchelevent as they went along and raising his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than mine show me no 
 here it is said jean valjean 
 there is no one in the street said fauchelevent 
 give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me 
 fauchelevent entered no ascended to the very top guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic 
 a voice replied 
 come in 
 it was voice 
 fauchelevent opened the door 
 the dwelling was like all such wretched habitations an unfurnished and encumbered garret a coffin the place of a commode a served for a a straw mattress served for a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs 
 in a corner on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap 
 the whole of this interior bore traces of having been overturned one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one the covers were displaced the rags scattered about the jug broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and search 
 it was plain that the had made a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret from the jug to his wife responsible for its loss 
 he wore an air of desperation 
 but fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success 
 he entered and said 
 i have brought you back your shovel and pick 
 gribier gazed at him in stupefaction 
 is it you peasant 
 and morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery 
 and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor 
 what is the meaning of this demanded gribier 
 the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were gone that i have buried the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs 
 there you have it conscript 
 thanks villager exclaimed gribier radiant 
 the next time i will pay for the drinks

 book eight 
 chapter i 
 
 after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow 
 in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown 
 moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre like a guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to everyone 
 benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly smile and jests reconciled the antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there 
 when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il pas de sexe they said of him 
 he is charming he has no sex 
 pierre was one of those retired of whom there were hundreds ending their days in moscow 
 how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs 
 but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife a retired fond of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow he had so despised seven years before 
 sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained 
 in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired he had formerly despised they were empty stupid contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path in life of their own and like me were brought by force of circumstances society and race by that elemental force against which man is powerless to the condition i am in said he to himself in moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his comrades in destiny as he pitied himself 
 pierre longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment what for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them and took up a book or hurried of to the club or to apollon to exchange the gossip of the town 
 helene who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it must be so but i what is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above all read 
 he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the influence of wine he said to himself it matter get it unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time now think it all out later on but the later on never came 
 in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and if anyone came to see him he was glad 
 sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the fire if they have nothing to do try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is important all the same only to save oneself from it as best one can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter viii 
 
 a successful interrogatory 
 an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no rue the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped 
 they were fauchelevent jean valjean and cosette 
 the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the in the rue du where fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day 
 cosette had passed these hours trembling silently and understanding nothing 
 she trembled to such a degree that she wept 
 she had neither eaten nor slept the worthy had plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days 
 she divined that they were passing through a crisis she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being say nothing 
 fear is mute 
 moreover no one guards a secret like a child 
 but when at the expiration of these lugubrious hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry would have guessed that it issued from an abyss 
 fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the all the doors opened 
 thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in 
 the porter who had received his instructions opened the little door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance 
 the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that point they reached the inner reserved parlor where fauchelevent on the preceding day had received his orders from the prioress 
 the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them 
 a vocal mother with her veil lowered stood beside her 
 a discreet candle lighted one might almost say made a show of lighting the parlor 
 the prioress passed jean valjean in review 
 there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye 
 then she questioned him 
 you are the brother 
 yes reverend mother replied fauchelevent 
 what is your name 
 fauchelevent replied 
 ultime fauchelevent 
 he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead 
 where do you come from 
 fauchelevent replied 
 from picquigny near amiens 
 what is your age 
 fauchelevent replied 
 fifty 
 what is your profession 
 fauchelevent replied 
 gardener 
 are you a good christian 
 fauchelevent replied 
 every one is in the family 
 is this your little girl 
 fauchelevent replied 
 yes reverend mother 
 you are her father 
 fauchelevent replied 
 her grandfather 
 the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice 
 he answers well 
 jean valjean had not uttered a single word 
 the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said 
 father fauvent you will get another with a bell two will be required now 
 on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils 
 at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men fauvent and another man were visible as they dug side by side 
 an enormous event 
 their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other 
 he is an assistant gardener 
 the vocal mothers added 
 he is a brother of father fauvent 
 jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belled henceforth he was official 
 his name was ultime fauchelevent 
 the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the observation upon cosette 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil 
 there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this 
 it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty 
 hence a lively taste for plain girls 
 the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old fauchelevent he won a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of gribier who said to himself 
 he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god there was a coffin containing a body in the and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby but no one was aware of it 
 as for the convent its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners 
 upon the occasion of the next visit the prioress recounted the affair to his grace making something of a confession at the same time and yet boasting of her deed on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper to m de latil confessor afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal 
 this admiration for fauchelevent became widespread for it made its way to rome we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope leo xii to one of his relatives a monsignor in the establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of della genga it contained these lines 
 it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener who is also a holy man named fauvent nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity neither did he suspect his glory any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news with this inscription 
 bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show
