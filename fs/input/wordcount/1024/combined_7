 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right

 the drops onto the table startling her 
 
 sorry mean to scare ya 
 elvelyn

 reaches into the and starts pulling out 
 revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
 and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite 
 evelyn

 dismantling and cleaning the guns

 evelyn 
 yes hoping to find a certain 
 artifact a book actually my 
 brother thinks treasure 
 what do you think is out there 
 looks into eyes 
 
 evil the tuaregs and the bedouin 
 believe that hamunaptra is cursed 
 they call it the doorway to hell 
 evelyn 
 ahmar is ossirion passageway 
 to the underworld actually 
 she gives him a grin 
 evelyn 
 i believe in fairy tales 
 and hokum mister connell but 
 i do believe that one of the most 
 famous books in history is buried 
 out there the book of the living 
 what first interested me in 
 egypt as a child why i came 
 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert

 the city of the dead truly 
 evelyn

 evelyn hesitates bites her lip eyes bulge as he 
 looks up at her he believe this girl

 evelyn

 one single farthing more 
 
 the warden flashes a big green smile then yells in arabic 
 a scimitar slashes the air the rope is cut 
 crashes to the ground half dead rolls over gagging 
 all of the prisoners burst into cheers looks 
 up at evelyn she smiles broadly and waves down at him 
 office night 
 candle light flickers across the face 
 curator 
 she must die 
 standing in the shadows across from his desk are three mumia 
 blue tinted skin hideous facial tattoos the works one of 
 the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand he shrugs 
 hook 
 she is like all the others 
 she will die in the desert 
 curator 
 no she has seen too much she 
 knows too much 
 the curator leans across his desk fear in his eyes 
 curator 
 not only does she have a map 
 but she has the key 
 spooks the hell out of the mumia guys 
 hook 
 the key she has the lost key 
 curator 
 yes no one has ever had so much 
 been so close we must stop her 
 or it will be the end of us all 
 hook 
 then we will kill her we will 
 kill her and all those with her 
 curator 
 and burn the map and retrieve the key 
 hook 
 it will be done but what of 
 the american expedition they 
 leave tomorrow as well 
 curator 
 forget the bumbling americans 
 they will be like all the others 
 without the map to guide them how 
 can they possibly find hamunaptra 
 ext giza port day 
 smash cut to our old traitorous friend beni 
 beni 
 it is three days down the nile 
 then two days by camel sahibs 
 we crane back to reveal beni standing on the bow of a 
 passenger barge surrounded by daniels henderson and burns 
 daniels 
 for all the money paying 
 you something better 
 well be under that sand 
 we keep craning back as henderson slaps daniels on the back 
 henderson 
 hamunaptra daniels 
 all ya gotta keep sayin to 
 yourself hamunaptra 
 now we see all of giza port team of explorers swarm the 
 docks across the nile the pyramids spike the sky evelyn 
 and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers 
 selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures 
 evelyn 
 do you really think show up 
 jonathan 
 undoubtedly i know the breed 
 he may be a cowboy but his 
 word is his word 
 evelyn 
 personally i think filthy 
 rude and a complete scoundrel 
 i like him one bit 
 
 anyone i know 
 they both turn walks up shaved showered spit 
 and polished with a new haircut and clothes he looks more 
 dashing and handsome than ever evelyn is suitably impressed 
 evelyn 
 oh 
 jonathan grabs arm and shakes his hand 
 jonathan 
 smashing day for the start of 
 an adventure eh 
 quickly checks his pockets 
 
 yeah sure smashing 
 he finds his wallet and relaxes directly above him on the 
 bow of the barge burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni 
 burns 
 sure hamunaptra is out there 
 beni 
 along with the scorched bones 
 of my entire garrison sahib 
 and when beni spots beni shakes his head 
 as if seeing a mirage then starts backing away from the men 
 beni 
 a thousand pardons my good sahibs 
 but there is much work to be done 
 beni quickly scurries off vanishing down into the hold 
 back down with evelyn recovering she clears her throat 
 evelyn 
 mister can you look 
 me in the eye and guarantee me 
 this is not some sort of flimflam 
 because if it is warning you 
 steps up close to evelyn invading her space 
 looks her straight in the eye evelyn back away 
 
 all i can tell you miss is that my 
 colonel found that map in an ancient 
 fortress and the whole damn garrison 
 believed in it so much that without 
 orders we marched halfway across 
 libya and into egypt to find that city 
 like i told ya all i saw was sand 
 everybody else was by 
 tuareg warriors take your bags 
 takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
 the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on 
 eyes follow him a bit wistfully jonathan sees it 
 jonathan 
 yes yes right filthy 
 rude a complete scoundrel 
 nothing to like there at all 
 evelyn gives him a look jonathan just grins and when 
 the warden suddenly brushes past tipping his raggedy hat 
 warden 
 a bright good morning to all 
 evelyn 
 what are you doing here 
 warden 
 i have come to protect my 
 investment thank you very much 
 and up the plank he goes evelyn and jonathan share a look 
 we go wide again as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
 nile we tilt up to the sun which then dissolves into 
 ext river nile night 
 the moon shining down on the desert the three vicious 
 mumia quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river the 
 one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff the other 
 two row heading for the passenger barge coming their way 
 ext the bar at the bow night 
 jonathan and the three americans are playing poker 
 comes out a door carrying a 
 jonathan 
 sit down sit down 
 we could use another good player 
 
 i only gamble with my life 
 never my money 
 daniels 
 never what if i were to wager 
 five hundred dollars says we 
 get to hamunaptra before you 
 returns cocky look 
 
 
 yer on 
 burns slips on his dirty bifocals 
 burns 
 what makes you so confident sir 
 
 what makes you 
 henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon 
 henderson 
 we got us a man actually been there 
 poker face drops perplexed same with jonathan 
 jonathan 
 i say what a coincidence why 
 accidentally hits him in the ribs with the 
 shutting him up jonathan quickly covers 
 jonathan 
 whose deal is it is it my deal 
 i thought i just dealt 
 ext barge night 
 evelyn sits on a table staring out over the passing river 
 the drops onto the table startling her 
 
 sorry mean to scare ya 
 elvelyn 
 the only thing that scares me 
 mister are your manners 
 
 still angry that i kissed ya huh 
 evelyn 
 if you call that a kiss 
 reaches into the and starts pulling out 
 revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
 and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite 
 evelyn 
 did i miss something are we 
 going into battle 
 
 the last time i was at that place 
 everybody i was with died 
 this takes the smile off face starts 
 dismantling and cleaning the guns 
 
 something out there you 
 know something under that sand 
 evelyn 
 yes hoping to find a certain 
 artifact a book actually my 
 brother thinks treasure 
 what do you think is out there 
 looks into eyes 
 
 evil the tuaregs and the bedouin 
 believe that hamunaptra is cursed 
 they call it the doorway to hell 
 evelyn 
 ahmar is ossirion passageway 
 to the underworld actually 
 she gives him a grin 
 evelyn 
 i believe in fairy tales 
 and hokum mister connell but 
 i do believe that one of the most 
 famous books in history is buried 
 out there the book of the living 
 what first interested me in 
 egypt as a child why i came 
 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert

 chapter 
 
 the dominant primordial beast 
 
 
 the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts 
 on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other 
 early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at yea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark 
 close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size 
 francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble he cried to buck give it to him by gar give it to him the dirty thief 
 spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil 
 an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured 
 in the meantime the astonished had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side 
 perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but is was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of charge then joined the flight out on the lake 
 later the nine gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at yea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs 
 ah my friends he said softly mebbe it make you mad dog those many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam what you think eh perrault 
 the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson 
 the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments 
 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled 
 in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity he seemed to remember it white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things 
 spitz was a practiced fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack 
 in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of spitz fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his guard then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes time and time again he tried for the throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him but instead shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away 
 spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited 
 but buck possessed a quality that made for he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg despite the pain and helplessness spitz struggled madly to keep up he saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten

 the dominant primordial beast 
 
 
 the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts 
 on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other 
 early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at yea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark 
 close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size 
 francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble he cried to buck give it to him by gar give it to him the dirty thief 
 spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil 
 an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured 
 in the meantime the astonished had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side 
 perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but is was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of charge then joined the flight out on the lake 
 later the nine gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at yea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs 
 ah my friends he said softly mebbe it make you mad dog those many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam what you think eh perrault 
 the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson 
 the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments 
 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled

 ext fire 
 in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at 
 her she can only go up 
 
 ext roof 
 on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over 
 the parapet leading the cops in pursuit 
 trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her 
 moverents so clean gliding in and out of each jump 
 contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops 
 agent brown however has the same unnatural grace 
 the metal scream of an el train is heard and trinity 
 turns to it racing for the back of the building 
 the edge falls away into a wide back alley the next 
 building is over feet away but face is 
 perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other 
 roof 
 the cops slow realizing they are about to see something 
 ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself 
 into the air 
 from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
 hangs in flight 
 then hitting somersaulting up still running hard 
 cop 
 motherfucker impossible 
 they stare as agent brown duplicates the 
 move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto 
 one knee 
 just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
 riveted steel the train screeches beneath her a 
 rattling blur of gray metal trinity junps landing 
 easily 
 she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air 
 barely reaching the last car 
 agent brown stands yanking out a gun 
 trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head 
 ahead she sees her only chance feet beyond the point 
 where the train has begun to turn there is 
 a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick 
 building 
 trinity zeroes in on it running as hard as she can her 
 speed compounded by the train the scream of the steel 
 rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the 
 turn 
 trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body 
 leveling into a dive she falls arms covering her head 
 as 
 the whole world seems to spin on its axis 
 and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down 
 stairs bleeding broken 
 but still alive 
 through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown 
 still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the 
 wind he touches his ear piece as the train 
 slides him past the window 
 trinity tries to move everything hurts 
 trinity 
 get up trinity fine 
 get up just get up 
 she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs 
 
 ext street 
 trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the 
 end of the block in a pool of white street light she 
 sees it 
 the telephone booth 
 obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk 
 focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone 
 begins to ring 
 across the street a garbage truck suddenly its 
 tires screaming as it accelerates 
 trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the 
 telephone booth as if taking aim 
 gritting through the pain she races the truck 
 slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly 
 bright bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as 
 she answers the phone 
 there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
 mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk 
 barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick 
 wall smashing it to plexiglas pulp 
 after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
 the garbage truck agent smith inspects the wreckage 
 there is no body trinity is gone 
 his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration 
 agent jones walks up behind him 
 agent smith 
 did you get anything from the room 
 agent jones 
 their next target the name is neo 
 the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground 
 separated in the crash like a severed limb 
 agent smith 
 need a search running 
 agent jones 
 already begun 
 we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer 
 and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
 like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall 
 through one 
 swallowed by the darkness that becomes 
 a computer screen 
 we are inside a chat room called the matrix 
 it is an exklusive where hackers hang out 
 screen 
 jackon i heard morpheus has been on this board

 ext fire 
 in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at 
 her she can only go up 
 
 ext roof 
 on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over 
 the parapet leading the cops in pursuit 
 trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her 
 moverents so clean gliding in and out of each jump 
 contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops 
 agent brown however has the same unnatural grace 
 the metal scream of an el train is heard and trinity 
 turns to it racing for the back of the building 
 the edge falls away into a wide back alley the next 
 building is over feet away but face is 
 perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other 
 roof 
 the cops slow realizing they are about to see something 
 ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself 
 into the air 
 from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
 hangs in flight 
 then hitting somersaulting up still running hard 
 cop 
 motherfucker impossible 
 they stare as agent brown duplicates the 
 move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto 
 one knee 
 just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
 riveted steel the train screeches beneath her a 
 rattling blur of gray metal trinity junps landing 
 easily 
 she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air 
 barely reaching the last car 
 agent brown stands yanking out a gun 
 trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head 
 ahead she sees her only chance feet beyond the point 
 where the train has begun to turn there is 
 a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick 
 building 
 trinity zeroes in on it running as hard as she can her 
 speed compounded by the train the scream of the steel 
 rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the 
 turn 
 trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body 
 leveling into a dive she falls arms covering her head 
 as 
 the whole world seems to spin on its axis 
 and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down 
 stairs bleeding broken 
 but still alive 
 through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown 
 still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the 
 wind he touches his ear piece as the train 
 slides him past the window 
 trinity tries to move everything hurts 
 trinity 
 get up trinity fine 
 get up just get up 
 she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs 
 
 ext street 
 trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the 
 end of the block in a pool of white street light she 
 sees it 
 the telephone booth 
 obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk 
 focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone 
 begins to ring 
 across the street a garbage truck suddenly its 
 tires screaming as it accelerates 
 trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the 
 telephone booth as if taking aim 
 gritting through the pain she races the truck 
 slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly 
 bright bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as 
 she answers the phone 
 there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
 mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk 
 barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick 
 wall smashing it to plexiglas pulp 
 after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
 the garbage truck agent smith inspects the wreckage 
 there is no body trinity is gone 
 his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration 
 agent jones walks up behind him 
 agent smith 
 did you get anything from the room 
 agent jones 
 their next target the name is neo 
 the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground 
 separated in the crash like a severed limb 
 agent smith 
 need a search running 
 agent jones 
 already begun 
 we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer 
 and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
 like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall 
 through one 
 swallowed by the darkness that becomes 
 a computer screen 
 we are inside a chat room called the matrix 
 it is an exklusive where hackers hang out

lionfish nov chapter three the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the 
 
 mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george elder twin brothers 
 
 all right harry asked george 
 
 been going on said ron why you been answering my letters asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles 
 
 it me and how did he know 
 
 he works for the ministry said ron you know not supposed to do spells outside school 
 
 you should talk said harry staring at the floating car 
 
 oh this count said ron only borrowing this we enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with 
 
 i told you i but take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and let me come back and obviously i magic myself out because the think the second spell done in three days so 
 
 stop gibbering said ron come to take you home with us 
 
 but you magic me out either 
 
 we need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who got with me 
 
 tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry 
 
 if the dursleys wake up dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car 
 
 worry said fred and stand back 
 
 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough 
 
 at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window 
 
 uncle vernon coughed again 
 
 a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push 
 
 harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car 
 
 okay go george whispered 
 
 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice 
 
 that ruddy owl 
 
 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening 
 
 harry told them all about dobby the warning given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished 
 
 very fishy said fred finally 
 
 definitely dodgy agreed george so he even tell you supposed to be plotting all this stuff 
 
 i think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall 
 
 he saw fred and george look at each other 
 
 what you think he was lying to me said harry 
 
 well said fred put it this way have got powerful magic of their own but they usually use it without their permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you 
 
 yes said harry and ron together instantly 
 
 draco malfoy harry explained he hates me 
 
 draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius son 
 
 must be not a very common name is it said harry 
 
 heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of 
 
 and when disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in you inner circle 
 
 harry had heard these rumors about family before and they surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy 
 
 i know whether the malfoys own a said harry 
 
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and be rich said fred 
 
 yeah always wishing we had a to do the ironing said george but all got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden come with big old manors and castles and places like that you catch one in our house 
 
 harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously 
 
 glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you answer any of my letters i thought it was fault at first 
 
 errol 
 
 our owl ancient it be the first time collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes 
 
 who 
 
 the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front 
 
 but percy lend him to me said ron said he needed him 
 
 been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean only so many times you can polish a prefect badge driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel 
 
 so does your dad know got the car said harry guessing the answer 
 
 er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it 
 
 what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway 
 
 he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 
 the what 
 
 all to do with bewitching things that are you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks 
 
 what happened 
 
 the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up 
 
 but your dad this car 
 
 fred laughed yeah crazy about everything to do with muggles our full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad 
 
 the main road said george peering down through the windshield be there in ten minutes just as well getting light 
 
 a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east 
 
 fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees 
 
 a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole 
 
 lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees 
 
 touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at house 
 
 it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard 
 
 not much said ron 
 
 wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive 
 
 they got out of the car 
 
 now go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car 
 
 right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top 
 
 ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around 
 
 mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a tiger 
 
 ah said fred 
 
 oh dear said george 
 
 mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket 
 
 so she said 
 
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice 
 
 have you any idea how worried been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper 
 
 sorry mum but see we had to 
 
 all three of mrs sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them 
 
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy 
 
 perfect percy muttered fred 
 
 you could do with taking a leaf out of book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job 
 
 it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away 
 
 very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast 
 
 she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her 
 
 the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before 
 
 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the 
 
 mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george elder twin brothers 
 
 all right harry asked george 
 
 been going on said ron why you been answering my letters asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles 
 
 it me and how did he know 
 
 he works for the ministry said ron you know not supposed to do spells outside school 
 
 you should talk said harry staring at the floating car 
 
 oh this count said ron only borrowing this we enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with 
 
 i told you i but take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and let me come back and obviously i magic myself out because the think the second spell done in three days so 
 
 stop gibbering said ron come to take you home with us 
 
 but you magic me out either 
 
 we need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who got with me 
 
 tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry 
 
 if the dursleys wake up dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car 
 
 worry said fred and stand back 
 
 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough 
 
 at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window 
 
 uncle vernon coughed again 
 
 a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push 
 
 harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car 
 
 okay go george whispered 
 
 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice 
 
 that ruddy owl 
 
 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening 
 
 harry told them all about dobby the warning given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished 
 
 very fishy said fred finally 
 
 definitely dodgy agreed george so he even tell you supposed to be plotting all this stuff 
 
 i think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall 
 
 he saw fred and george look at each other 
 
 what you think he was lying to me said harry 
 
 well said fred put it this way have got powerful magic of their own but they usually use it without their permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you 
 
 yes said harry and ron together instantly 
 
 draco malfoy harry explained he hates me 
 
 draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius son 
 
 must be not a very common name is it said harry 
 
 heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of 
 
 and when disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in you inner circle 
 
 harry had heard these rumors about family before and they surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy 
 
 i know whether the malfoys own a said harry 
 
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and be rich said fred 
 
 yeah always wishing we had a to do the ironing said george but all got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden come with big old manors and castles and places like that you catch one in our house 
 
 harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously 
 
 glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you answer any of my letters i thought it was fault at first 
 
 errol 
 
 our owl ancient it be the first time collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes 
 
 who 
 
 the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front 
 
 but percy lend him to me said ron said he needed him 
 
 been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean only so many times you can polish a prefect badge driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel 
 
 so does your dad know got the car said harry guessing the answer 
 
 er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it 
 
 what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway 
 
 he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 
 the what 
 
 all to do with bewitching things that are you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks 
 
 what happened 
 
 the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up 
 
 but your dad this car 
 
 fred laughed yeah crazy about everything to do with muggles our full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad 
 
 the main road said george peering down through the windshield be there in ten minutes just as well getting light 
 
 a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east 
 
 fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees 
 
 a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole 
 
 lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees 
 
 touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at house 
 
 it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard 
 
 not much said ron 
 
 wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive 
 
 they got out of the car 
 
 now go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car 
 
 right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top 
 
 ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around 
 
 mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a tiger 
 
 ah said fred 
 
 oh dear said george 
 
 mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket 
 
 so she said 
 
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice 
 
 have you any idea how worried been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper 
 
 sorry mum but see we had to 
 
 all three of mrs sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them 
 
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy 
 
 perfect percy muttered fred 
 
 you could do with taking a leaf out of book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job 
 
 it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away 
 
 very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast 
 
 she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her 
 
 the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before 
 
 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the knight buscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart 
 
 but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives swooping down on him where he sat 
 
 harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent 
 
 what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them 
 
 he have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless 
 
 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus

 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically

 stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time

 he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry know anything about the wizard prison though everyone ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry soon forget the look of terror on face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew 
 
 the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go 
 
 finally harry was the only passenger left 
 
 right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london

 righto said stan old tight then 
 
 bang 
 
 they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he know 
 
 ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley 
 
 thanks harry said to ern 
 
 he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and cage onto the pavement 
 
 well said harry bye then 
 
 but stan paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 
 there you are harry said a voice 
 
 before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere 
 
 harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself 
 
 stan leapt onto the pavement beside them 
 
 what didja call neville minister he said excitedly 
 
 fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted 
 
 neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter 
 
 i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern arry potter i can see is scar 
 
 yes said fudge testily well very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now 
 
 fudge increased the pressure on shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord 
 
 got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy 
 
 perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still let go of harry 
 
 there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying trunk and cage and looking around excitedly 
 
 ow come you tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while owlish face peered interestedly over shoulder 
 
 and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly 
 
 bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar 
 
 bye neville called stan 
 
 fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room 
 
 sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire 
 
 harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his suit and sat down opposite harry 
 
 i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic 
 
 harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his invisibility cloak at the time fudge to know that 
 
 tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him 
 
 well harry said fudge pouring out tea had us all in a right flap i mind telling you running away from your aunt and house like that started to thinkbut safe and what matters 
 
 fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry 
 
 eat harry you look dead on your feet now thenyou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so that and no harm done 
 
 fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who believe his ears opened his mouth to speak think of anything to say and closed it again 
 
 ah worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays 
 
 harry unstuck his throat 
 
 i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i ever want to go back to privet drive 
 
 now now sure feel differently once calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and sure you are fond of each other er very deep down 
 
 it occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now 
 
 so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and 
 
 hang on blurted harry what about my punishment 
 
 fudge blinked punishment 
 
 i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry 
 
 oh my dear boy not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts 
 
 but this tally at all with past dealings with the ministry of magic 
 
 last year i got an official warning just because a smashed a pudding in my house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there 
 
 unless eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward

 of course i said harry 
 
 well then all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if got a room for you 
 
 fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what done and now harry came to think of it surely it usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic 
 
 fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper 
 
 room free harry said fudge i think be very comfortable just one thing and sure understandi want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and to be back here before dark each night sure understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me

 fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak 
 
 well be off plenty to do you know 
 
 have you had any luck with black yet harry asked 
 
 finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak 
 
 that oh heard well no not yet but only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failedand they are angrier than ever seen them 
 
 fudge shuddered slightly 
 
 so say 
 
 he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea 
 
 er minister can i ask you something 
 
 certainly said fudge with a smile 
 
 well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle sign the permission form think you could 
 
 fudge was looking uncomfortable 
 
 ah he said no no very sorry harry but as not your parent or guardian 
 
 but the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission 
 
 no sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly 
 
 perhaps be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think best if you be off enjoy your stay harry 
 
 and with a last smile and shake of hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry 
 
 if follow me mr potter he said already taken your things up 
 
 harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him 
 
 inside was a very bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe 
 
 hedwig harry gasped 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto arm 
 
 very smart owl got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if anything you need mr potter hesitate to ask 
 
 he gave another bow and left 
 
 harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that left privet drive only a few hours ago that he expelled and that he was now facing two completely weeks 
 
 been a very weird night hedwig he yawned 
 
 and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the knight buscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart 
 
 but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives swooping down on him where he sat 
 
 harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent 
 
 what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them 
 
 he have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless 
 
 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus

 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically

lionfish nov chapter three the invitationcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report a boisterous little boy but he hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully 
 
 however at the bottom of the report there were a few comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale 
 
 so after many tantrums after arguments that shook bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry 
 
 but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from house with a large box stuffed full of snacks parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry touched these he had had too much experience of cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint 
 
 uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter 
 
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia 
 
 aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes 
 
 uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon 
 
 the doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle grapefruit 
 
 harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall 
 
 aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked livid 
 
 you he barked at harry in the living room now 
 
 bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them 
 
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest so 
 
 harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled 
 
 this just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about you 
 
 confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postman 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud 
 
 dear mr and mrs dursley 
 we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron 
 as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports 
 i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a opportunity britain hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school 
 it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is 
 hoping to see harry soon 
 yours sincerely 
 molly weasley 
 i do hope put enough stamps on 
 uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else 
 
 look at this he growled 
 
 he held up the envelope in which mrs letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing 
 
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs was a mistake anyone could make his eyes flashed 
 
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funny 
 
 harry say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley 
 
 uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silence 
 
 so can i go then he asked 
 
 a slight spasm crossed uncle large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs letter again 
 
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste 
 
 seen her said harry my friend mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term 
 
 he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley household 
 
 uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant 
 
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hair 
 
 harry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall 
 
 uncle vernon was perusing the letter again 
 
 quidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbish 
 
 harry felt a second stab of annoyance 
 
 a sport he said shortly played on broom 
 
 all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answerin the normal way he scowled 
 
 what does she mean the normal way he spat 
 
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post normal for wizards 
 
 uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back 
 
 only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans 
 
 i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage 
 
 but harry going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he following diet and he going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i see the world cup can i go now then only got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfather 
 
 he had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
 
 writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear 
 
 well yeah said harry casually been a while since he heard from me and you know if he he might start thinking wrong 
 
 he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then 
 
 well all right then you can go to this ruddythis stupidthis world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys to pick you up mind i got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfathertell himtell him going 
 
 okay then said harry brightly 
 
 he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was goinghe was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup 
 
 outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on face 
 
 that was an excellent breakfast it said harry i feel really full you 
 
 laughing at the astonished look on face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom 
 
 the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once 
 
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled note 
 
 harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night writing to the muggles to ask you to stay they might already have the letter i know how fast muggle post is thought send this with pig anyway 
 harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig maybe he read writing he went back to the letter 
 
 coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon better if we pretend to ask their permission first if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and come and get you at five on sunday if they say no send pig back pronto and come and get you at five on sunday anyway 
 arriving this afternoon started work the department of international magical cooperation mention anything about abroad while here unless you want the pants bored off you 
 see you soon 
 ron 
 calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person come here i need you to take my answer back 
 
 the owl fluttered down on top of cage hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer 
 
 harry seized his quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote 
 
 ron all okay the muggles say i can come see you five tomorrow wait 
 harry 
 he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight 
 
 harry turned to hedwig 
 
 feeling up to a long journey he asked her 
 
 hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way 
 
 can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter hang oni just want to finish it 
 
 he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript 
 
 if you want to contact me be at my friend ron for the rest of the summer his got us tickets for the quidditch world cup 
 the letter finished he tied it to leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave 
 
 be at when you get back all right harry told her 
 
 she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window 
 
 harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort

 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report

lionfish nov chapter three the advance guardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know going on and when going to get out of here 
 
 harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully 
 
 up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magicand still no one was telling him what was going on 
 
 and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen 
 
 why was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid do any more magic stay in the house 
 
 he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body 
 
 just as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost 
 
 about time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down got work for you 
 
 large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak 
 
 come here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till written answers if got to understand 
 
 hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frog 
 
 get going then said harry 
 
 she took off immediately the moment gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermione 
 
 they were bound to write back quickly they possibly ignore a dementor attack probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought 
 
 
 
 
 but hedwig return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry perform more illegal magic 
 
 so it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing 
 
 what if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again 
 
 on the fourth night after departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness 
 
 going out he said 
 
 sorry 
 
 wethat is to say your aunt dudley and iare going out 
 
 fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling 
 
 you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away 
 
 ok 
 
 you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessions 
 
 right 
 
 you are not to steal food from the fridge 
 
 ok 
 
 i am going to lock your door 
 
 you do that 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive 
 
 harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned 
 
 the empty house creaked around him the pipes gurgled harry lay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in misery 
 
 then quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen below 
 
 he sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys be back it was much too soon and in any case he heard their car 
 
 there was silence for a few seconds then voices 
 
 burglars he thought sliding off the bed on to his feetbut a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so 
 
 he snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open 
 
 harry stood motionless staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing straining his ears for further sounds but none came he hesitated for a moment then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs 
 
 his heart shot upwards into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all as far as he could see looking up at him 
 
 lower your wand boy before you take eye out said a low growling voice 
 
 heart was thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wand 
 
 professor moody he said uncertainly 
 
 i know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properly 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was company only to find out that it moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who 
 
 all right harry come to take you away 
 
 heart leapt he knew that voice too though he heard it for over a year 
 
 lupin he said disbelievingly is that you 
 
 why are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a lumos 
 
 a flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs gazing up at him intently some craning their heads for a better look 
 
 remus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more grey hairs than when harry had last said to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he was smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back despite his state of shock 
 
 oooh he looks just like i thought he would said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale face dark twinkling eyes and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet wotcher harry 
 
 yeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing furthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he looks exactly like james 
 
 except the eyes said a wizard at the back eyes 
 
 moody who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eyes one eye was small dark and beady the other large round and electric bluethe magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of own head 
 
 are you quite sure him lupin he growled be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserum 
 
 harry what form does your patronus take lupin asked 
 
 a stag said harry nervously 
 
 him said lupin 
 
 very conscious of everybody still staring at him harry descended the stairs stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came 
 
 put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizards than you have lost buttocks you know 
 
 who know lost a buttock the woman asked interestedly 
 
 never you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled elementary nobody bothers about it any more he stumped off towards the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling 
 
 lupin held out his hand and shook 
 
 how are you he asked looking closely at harry 
 
 
 
 harry could hardly believe this was real four weeks with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing in the house as though this was a arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days 
 
 really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbled 
 
 lucky ha said the woman it was me who lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling them been for the best kept suburban lawn competition heading off to the right now or they think they are 
 
 harry had a fleeting vision of uncle face when he realised there was no best kept suburban lawn competition 
 
 we are leaving we he asked soon 
 
 almost at once said lupin just waiting for the 
 
 where are we going the burrow harry asked hopefully 
 
 not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky set up headquarters somewhere taken a while 
 
 moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many appliances 
 
 this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody 
 
 yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody thought known for a year 
 
 and this is nymphadora 
 
 call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder tonks 
 
 nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin 
 
 so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks 
 
 and this is kingsley indicated the tall black wizard who wizard diggle 
 
 met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat 
 
 emmeline witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her wizard with thick hair hestia jones a witch waved from next to the toaster 
 
 harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered he also wondered why so many of them were there 
 
 a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightly 
 
 yeah well the more the better said moody darkly your guard potter 
 
 just waiting for the signal to tell us safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window got about fifteen minutes 
 
 very clean they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my and a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizards 
 
 eryeah said harry turned back to going on i heard anything from anyone vol 
 
 several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up 
 
 what said harry 
 
 not discussing anything here too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuckever since that scum wore it 
 
 and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye 
 
 you do know disgusting you said tonks conversationally 
 
 get me a glass of water would you harry requested moody 
 
 harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy him 
 
 cheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey 
 
 we gettingwherever going harry asked 
 
 brooms said lupin only way too young to apparate be watching the floo network and more than our worth to set up an unauthorised portkey 
 
 remus says a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice 
 
 excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comes 
 
 come and help you said tonks brightly 
 
 she followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interest 
 
 funny place she said a bit too clean know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered bedroom and he turned on the light 
 
 his room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around it 
 
 harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door 
 
 you know i think really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair think it makes me look a bit peaky 
 
 er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and ireland 
 
 yeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned pink 
 
 how did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes again 
 
 a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was great 
 
 an auror said harry impressed being a was the only career ever considered after hogwarts 
 
 yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs 
 
 can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing 
 
 tonks chuckled 
 
 bet you mind hiding that scar sometimes eh 
 
 her eyes found the scar on forehead 
 
 no i mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar 
 
 well have to learn the hard way afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare born not made most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but got to get going harry supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor 
 
 ohyeah said harry grabbing a few more books 
 
 be stupid be much quicker if ipack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor 
 
 books clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew into the trunk 
 
 not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut never mastered how she does a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully 
 
 one of socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk 
 
 ah well said tonks slamming the lid shut at least all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well a bit better never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells rightgot everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt 
 
 her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an broomstick 
 
 and still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok go locomotor trunk 
 
 trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick 
 
 back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys 
 
 excellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so ready harry left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry 
 
 they said harry 
 
 that safe 
 
 just depress them 
 
 and see them next summer 
 
 do i have to 
 
 lupin smiled but made no answer 
 
 come here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry towards him with his wand i need to disillusion you 
 
 you need to what said harry nervously 
 
 disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says got an invisibility cloak but it stay on while flying disguise you better here you go 
 
 he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck 
 
 nice one said tonks appreciatively staring at midriff 
 
 harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon 
 
 come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand 
 
 they all stepped outside on to uncle beautifully kept lawn 
 
 clear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heavens done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry going to be flying in close formation be right in front of you keep close on her tail be covering you from below going to be behind you the be circling us we break ranks for anything got me if one of us is killed 
 
 is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored him 
 
 the others keep flying stop break ranks if they take out all of us and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and join you 
 
 stop being so cheerful think not taking this seriously said tonks as she strapped trunk and cage into a harness hanging from her broom 
 
 just telling the boy the plan growled moody our to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt 
 
 no going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voice 
 
 mount your brooms the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the sky 
 
 far far above them a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars harry recognised them at once as wand sparks he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more 
 
 second signal go said lupin loudly as more sparks green this time exploded high above them 
 
 harry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure he was flying again flying away from privet drive as been fantasising about all summer he was going home for a few glorious moments all his problems seemed to recede to nothing insignificant in the vast starry sky 
 
 hard left hard left a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mile 
 
 eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps two of those tiny lights might belong to uncle car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happy 
 
 bearing south shouted town ahead 
 
 they soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below 
 
 bear southeast and keep climbing some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moody 
 
 not going through clouds shouted tonks angrily get soaked 
 
 harry was relieved to hear her say this his hands were growing numb on the handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he was starting to shiver 
 
 they altered their course every now and then according to instructions eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at least 
 
 turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway 
 
 harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore 
 
 we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure not being followed moody shouted 
 
 are you mad tonks screamed from the front all frozen to our brooms if we keep going not going to get there until next week besides nearly there now 
 
 time to start the descent came voice follow tonks harry 
 
 harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom 
 
 here we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landed 
 
 harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps 
 
 where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute 
 
 moody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with cold 
 
 got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it 
 
 the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead 
 
 borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick 
 
 he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them 
 
 the muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging just inside the broken gate 
 
 here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorise 
 
 harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it said 
 
 the headquarters of the order of the phoenix may be found at number twelve grimmauld place london 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the advance guardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know going on and when going to get out of here 
 
 harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully 
 
 up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magicand still no one was telling him what was going on 
 
 and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen 
 
 why was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid do any more magic stay in the house 
 
 he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body 
 
 just as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost 
 
 about time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down got work for you 
 
 large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak 
 
 come here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till written answers if got to understand 
 
 hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frog 
 
 get going then said harry 
 
 she took off immediately the moment gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermione 
 
 they were bound to write back quickly they possibly ignore a dementor attack probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought 
 
 
 
 
 but hedwig return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry perform more illegal magic 
 
 so it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing 
 
 what if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again 
 
 on the fourth night after departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness 
 
 going out he said 
 
 sorry 
 
 wethat is to say your aunt dudley and iare going out 
 
 fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling 
 
 you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away

 you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessions 
 
 right 
 
 you are not to steal food from the fridge 
 
 ok 
 
 i am going to lock your door 
 
 you do that 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive 
 
 harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned

 not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky set up headquarters somewhere taken a while 
 
 moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many appliances 
 
 this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody 
 
 yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody thought known for a year 
 
 and this is nymphadora 
 
 call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder tonks 
 
 nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin 
 
 so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks 
 
 and this is kingsley indicated the tall black wizard who wizard diggle 
 
 met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat 
 
 emmeline witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her wizard with thick hair hestia jones a witch waved from next to the toaster 
 
 harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered he also wondered why so many of them were there 
 
 a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightly 
 
 yeah well the more the better said moody darkly your guard potter 
 
 just waiting for the signal to tell us safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window got about fifteen minutes 
 
 very clean they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my and a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizards 
 
 eryeah said harry turned back to going on i heard anything from anyone vol 
 
 several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up 
 
 what said harry 
 
 not discussing anything here too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuckever since that scum wore it 
 
 and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye 
 
 you do know disgusting you said tonks conversationally 
 
 get me a glass of water would you harry requested moody 
 
 harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy him 
 
 cheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey 
 
 we gettingwherever going harry asked 
 
 brooms said lupin only way too young to apparate be watching the floo network and more than our worth to set up an unauthorised portkey 
 
 remus says a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice 
 
 excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comes 
 
 come and help you said tonks brightly 
 
 she followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interest 
 
 funny place she said a bit too clean know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered bedroom and he turned on the light 
 
 his room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around it 
 
 harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door 
 
 you know i think really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair think it makes me look a bit peaky 
 
 er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and ireland 
 
 yeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned pink 
 
 how did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes again 
 
 a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was great 
 
 an auror said harry impressed being a was the only career ever considered after hogwarts 
 
 yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs 
 
 can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing 
 
 tonks chuckled 
 
 bet you mind hiding that scar sometimes eh 
 
 her eyes found the scar on forehead 
 
 no i mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar 
 
 well have to learn the hard way afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare born not made most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but got to get going harry supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor 
 
 ohyeah said harry grabbing a few more books 
 
 be stupid be much quicker if ipack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor 
 
 books clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew into the trunk 
 
 not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut never mastered how she does a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully 
 
 one of socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk 
 
 ah well said tonks slamming the lid shut at least all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well a bit better never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells rightgot everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt 
 
 her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an broomstick 
 
 and still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok go locomotor trunk 
 
 trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick 
 
 back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys 
 
 excellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so ready harry left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry 
 
 they said harry 
 
 that safe 
 
 just depress them 
 
 and see them next summer 
 
 do i have to 
 
 lupin smiled but made no answer 
 
 come here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry towards him with his wand i need to disillusion you 
 
 you need to what said harry nervously 
 
 disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says got an invisibility cloak but it stay on while flying disguise you better here you go 
 
 he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck 
 
 nice one said tonks appreciatively staring at midriff 
 
 harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon 
 
 come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand 
 
 they all stepped outside on to uncle beautifully kept lawn 
 
 clear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heavens done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry going to be flying in close formation be right in front of you keep close on her tail be covering you from below going to be behind you the be circling us we break ranks for anything got me if one of us is killed 
 
 is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored him 
 
 the others keep flying stop break ranks if they take out all of us and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and join you 
 
 stop being so cheerful think not taking this seriously said tonks as she strapped trunk and cage into a harness hanging from her broom 
 
 just telling the boy the plan growled moody our to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt 
 
 no going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voice 
 
 mount your brooms the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the sky 
 
 far far above them a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars harry recognised them at once as wand sparks he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more 
 
 second signal go said lupin loudly as more sparks green this time exploded high above them 
 
 harry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure he was flying again flying away from privet drive as been fantasising about all summer he was going home for a few glorious moments all his problems seemed to recede to nothing insignificant in the vast starry sky 
 
 hard left hard left a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mile 
 
 eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps two of those tiny lights might belong to uncle car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happy 
 
 bearing south shouted town ahead 
 
 they soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below 
 
 bear southeast and keep climbing some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moody 
 
 not going through clouds shouted tonks angrily get soaked 
 
 harry was relieved to hear her say this his hands were growing numb on the handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he was starting to shiver 
 
 they altered their course every now and then according to instructions eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at least 
 
 turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway 
 
 harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore 
 
 we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure not being followed moody shouted 
 
 are you mad tonks screamed from the front all frozen to our brooms if we keep going not going to get there until next week besides nearly there now 
 
 time to start the descent came voice follow tonks harry 
 
 harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom 
 
 here we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landed 
 
 harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps 
 
 where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute 
 
 moody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with cold 
 
 got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it 
 
 the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead 
 
 borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick 
 
 he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them 
 
 the muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging just inside the broken gate 
 
 here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorise 
 
 harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it said 
 
 the headquarters of the order of the phoenix may be found at number twelve grimmauld place london 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter three will and prev chapter next chapter 
 harry potter was snoring loudly he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold his glasses askew and his mouth wide open the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair 
 
 the room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk the headline of one blared 
 
 harry potter the chosen one 
 
 rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which was sighted once more 
 
 not allowed to talk about it ask me anything said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the ministry last night 
 
 nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy 
 
 though ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eaters now serving sentences in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question some are going so far as to call potter the chosen one believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of 
 
 the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although cont page column 
 
 a second newspaper lay beside the first this one bore the headline 
 
 scrimgeour succeeds fudge 
 most of this front page was taken up with a large picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face the picture was movingthe man was waving at the ceiling 
 
 rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement has succeeded cornelius fudge as minister of magic the appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hours of scrimgeour taking office 
 representatives admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion albus dumbledore is known to cont page column 
 to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students safety safety was visible 
 
 newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn 
 for obvious reasons the ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans said the minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school 
 most seem reassured by the new tough stand on student safety said mrs augusta longbottom my grandson neville good friend of harry incidentally who fought the death eaters alongside him at the ministry in june and 
 but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it inside it was a magnificent snowy owl her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her 
 
 a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words 
 
 issued on behalf of the ministry of magic 
 
 protecting your home and family against dark forces 
 
 the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eaters observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack 
 
 you are advised not to leave the house alone 
 
 particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen 
 
 review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as shield and disillusionment charms and in the case of underage family members 
 
 agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect death eaters masquerading as others by use of the polyjuice potion see page 
 
 should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 
 
 should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately 
 
 unconfirmed sightings suggest that the death eaters may now be using inferi see page any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately 
 
 harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat 
 
 dear harry 
 
 if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays 
 
 if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you 
 
 kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday 
 
 i am yours most sincerely 
 
 albus dumbledore 
 
 though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive he knew it was pointless to keep rereading words harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not 
 
 but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wronghis reply to letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage 
 
 the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the outside the window went out 
 
 harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path 
 
 harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk then as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of clasps across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blazes is calling at this lime of night 
 
 harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky mid close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him 
 
 harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with silver hair and beard spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes 
 
 judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times 
 
 he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him 
 
 it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing 
 
 vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soonthe vein pulsing in his temple was reaching danger pointbut something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully 
 
 ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his glasses with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent 
 
 these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye 
 
 i mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable 
 
 yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia 
 
 the kitchen door had opened and there stood aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual of all the kitchen surfaces her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock 
 
 albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley 
 
 dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled 
 
 shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room 
 
 dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place 
 
 we leaving sir harry asked anxiously 
 
 yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and hospitality only a little longer 
 
 you will will you 
 
 vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both 
 
 yes said dumbledore simply i shall 
 
 he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position 
 
 we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
 
 sirwhat happened to your 
 
 later harry said dumbledore please sit down 
 
 harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence 
 
 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness 
 
 a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room 
 
 madam finest mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself 
 
 well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned 
 
 over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right 
 
 this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy 
 
 his dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of head he attempted to beat it away dead his godfather 
 
 yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him 
 
 you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i care you can have it i really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave 
 
 that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily 
 
 why 
 
 well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a 
 
 a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into mind i bet there has he said 
 
 quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange 
 
 without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange killer inherit his house 
 
 no he said 
 
 well obviously we would prefer that she get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position 
 
 but how are you going to find out if allowed to own it 
 
 fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test 
 
 he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us 
 
 harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere 
 
 oh so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know 
 
 it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on wand 
 
 you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited 
 
 he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a appeared with a snout for a nose giant ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that 
 
 kreacher finished dumbledore 
 
 kreacher kreacher kreacher croaked the quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher go to the potter brat kreacher 
 
 as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over continued croaks of wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership 
 
 i care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping i want him 
 
 
 
 you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year 
 
 
 
 harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant 
 
 give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress 
 
 
 
 voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up 
 
 it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum 
 
 well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it means that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher 
 
 do ido i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet 
 
 not if you want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other could keep an eye on him 
 
 yeah said harry in relief yeah do that erkreacheri want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other 
 
 kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished 
 
 good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements 
 
 no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that 
 
 hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed 
 
 erm 
 
 doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly 
 
 just go anderfinish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers 
 
 it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding cage in the other he made his way back downstairs 
 
 he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room 
 
 nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said ready now 
 
 good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more 
 
 as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a time 
 
 no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since arrival 
 
 sorry said dumbledore politely 
 
 no he a month younger than dudley and dudders turn eighteen until the year after next 
 
 ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen 
 
 uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him 
 
 now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own 
 
 dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together 
 
 you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you 
 
 both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them 
 
 usmistreat dudders what began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb 
 
 the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time 
 
 none of the dursleys said anything dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed 
 
 well harry time for us to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room 
 
 bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside trunk upon which cage was perched 
 
 we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await us there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness 
 
 and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter three will and prev chapter next chapter 
 harry potter was snoring loudly he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold his glasses askew and his mouth wide open the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair 
 
 the room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk the headline of one blared 
 
 harry potter the chosen one 
 
 rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which was sighted once more 
 
 not allowed to talk about it ask me anything said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the ministry last night 
 
 nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy 
 
 though ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eaters now serving sentences in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question some are going so far as to call potter the chosen one believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of 
 
 the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although cont page column 
 
 a second newspaper lay beside the first this one bore the headline 
 
 scrimgeour succeeds fudge 
 most of this front page was taken up with a large picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face the picture was movingthe man was waving at the ceiling 
 
 rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement has succeeded cornelius fudge as minister of magic the appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hours of scrimgeour taking office 
 representatives admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion albus dumbledore is known to cont page column 
 to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students safety safety was visible 
 
 newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn 
 for obvious reasons the ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans said the minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school 
 most seem reassured by the new tough stand on student safety said mrs augusta longbottom my grandson neville good friend of harry incidentally who fought the death eaters alongside him at the ministry in june and 
 but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it inside it was a magnificent snowy owl her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her 
 
 a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words 
 
 issued on behalf of the ministry of magic 
 
 protecting your home and family against dark forces 
 
 the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eaters observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack 
 
 you are advised not to leave the house alone 
 
 particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen 
 
 review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as shield and disillusionment charms and in the case of underage family members 
 
 agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect death eaters masquerading as others by use of the polyjuice potion see page 
 
 should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 
 
 should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately 
 
 unconfirmed sightings suggest that the death eaters may now be using inferi see page any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately 
 
 harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat 
 
 dear harry 
 
 if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays 
 
 if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you 
 
 kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday 
 
 i am yours most sincerely 
 
 albus dumbledore 
 
 though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive he knew it was pointless to keep rereading words harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not 
 
 but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wronghis reply to letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage 
 
 the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the outside the window went out 
 
 harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path 
 
 harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk then as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of clasps across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blazes is calling at this lime of night 
 
 harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky mid close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him 
 
 harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with silver hair and beard spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes 
 
 judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times 
 
 he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him 
 
 it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing 
 
 vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soonthe vein pulsing in his temple was reaching danger pointbut something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully 
 
 ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his glasses with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent 
 
 these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye 
 
 i mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable 
 
 yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia 
 
 the kitchen door had opened and there stood aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual of all the kitchen surfaces her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock 
 
 albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley 
 
 dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled 
 
 shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room 
 
 dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place 
 
 we leaving sir harry asked anxiously 
 
 yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and hospitality only a little longer 
 
 you will will you 
 
 vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both 
 
 yes said dumbledore simply i shall 
 
 he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position 
 
 we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
 
 sirwhat happened to your 
 
 later harry said dumbledore please sit down 
 
 harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence 
 
 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness 
 
 a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room 
 
 madam finest mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself 
 
 well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned 
 
 over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right 
 
 this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy 
 
 his dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of head he attempted to beat it away dead his godfather 
 
 yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him 
 
 you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i care you can have it i really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave 
 
 that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily 
 
 why 
 
 well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a 
 
 a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into mind i bet there has he said 
 
 quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange 
 
 without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange killer inherit his house 
 
 no he said 
 
 well obviously we would prefer that she get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position 
 
 but how are you going to find out if allowed to own it 
 
 fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test 
 
 he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us 
 
 harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere 
 
 oh so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know 
 
 it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on wand 
 
 you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited 
 
 he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a appeared with a snout for a nose giant ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that 
 
 kreacher finished dumbledore 
 
 kreacher kreacher kreacher croaked the quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher go to the potter brat kreacher 
 
 as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over continued croaks of wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership 
 
 i care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping i want him 
 
 
 
 you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year 
 
 
 
 harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant 
 
 give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress 
 
 
 
 voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up 
 
 it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum 
 
 well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it means that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher 
 
 do ido i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet 
 
 not if you want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other could keep an eye on him 
 
 yeah said harry in relief yeah do that erkreacheri want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other 
 
 kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished 
 
 good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements 
 
 no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that 
 
 hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed 
 
 erm 
 
 doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly 
 
 just go anderfinish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers 
 
 it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding cage in the other he made his way back downstairs 
 
 he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room 
 
 nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said ready now 
 
 good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more 
 
 as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a time 
 
 no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since arrival 
 
 sorry said dumbledore politely 
 
 no he a month younger than dudley and dudders turn eighteen until the year after next 
 
 ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen 
 
 uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him 
 
 now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own 
 
 dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together 
 
 you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you 
 
 both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them 
 
 usmistreat dudders what began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the dursleys departingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared oh you 
 
 sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond he was still at the narrow fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledores eye it was not until his uncle bellowed boy that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him 
 
 you took you time roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs get down here i want a word 
 
 harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his pants pockets when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys they were dressed for packing uncle vernon in an old jacket and dudley harrys large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket 
 
 yes asked harry 
 
 sit down said uncle vernon harry raised his eyebrows please added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat harry sat he thought he knew what was coming his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movement with anxious expressions finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke 
 
 ive changed my mind he said 
 
 what a surprise said harry 
 
 dont you take that tone c began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down its all a lot of claptrap said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes ive decided i dont believe a word of it were staying put were not going anywhere 
 
 harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart harrys favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware that dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing 
 
 according to you vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we c petunia dudley and i c are in danger from c from c 
 
 some of my lot right said harry 
 
 well i dont believe it repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe its a plot to get the house 
 
 the house repeated harry what house 
 
 this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c 
 
 are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look 
 
 dont you dare c squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted 
 
 just in case youve forgotten said harry ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories 
 
 there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument 
 
 you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c 
 
 c voldemort said harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already this isnt a claim its fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c 
 
 vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon 
 
 c kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you 
 
 uncle vernons and harrys eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is 
 
 uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbors lawn mower stalled again 
 
 i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly 
 
 there is said harry surprised 
 
 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection 
 
 harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated 
 
 uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration 
 
 all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke 
 
 harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times 
 
 as ive told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister 
 
 exactly c hes the best said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in 
 
 well hes taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c 
 
 if wed even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself 
 
 these accidents arent accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it c voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son 
 
 dudleys hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them 
 
 more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair c 
 
 all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley youve made your point c 
 
 i hope so said harry because once im seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help 
 
 there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudleys school i dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c 
 
 dont you understand shouted harry they will torture and kill you like they did my parents 
 
 dad said dudley in a loud voice dad c im going with these order people 
 
 dudley said harry for the first time in your life youre talking sense he knew the battle was won if dudley was frightened enough to accept the orders help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece 
 
 theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room the prospect of parting c probably forever c from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike 
 
 back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bats of hedwigs cage they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them 
 
 were leaving soon really soon harry told her and then youll be able to fly again 
 
 the doorbell rang harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own 
 
 harry potter squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow an honor as ever 
 
 thanks dedalus said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired hestia its really good of you to do this theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin 
 
 good day to you harry potters relatives said dedalus happily striding into the living room the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard 
 
 i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house charry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him c we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it he asked uncle vernon politely 
 
 know how to c of course i ruddy well know how to drive spluttered uncle vernon 
 
 very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said dedalus he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke 
 
 cant even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him 
 
 you harry dedalus continued will wait here for your guard there has been a little change in the arrangements c 
 
 what dyou mean said harry at once i thought was going to come and take me by side 
 
 cant do it said hestia tersely will explain 
 
 the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched hurry up harry looked all around the room before realizing the voice had issued from dedaluss pocket watch 
 
 quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist coat we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety he turned to the dursleys well are we all packed and ready to go 
 
 none of them answered him uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedaluss waistcoat pocket 
 
 perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus murmured hestia she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells 
 
 theres no need harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly well this is then boy 
 
 he swung his right arm upward to shake harrys hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome 
 
 ready duddy asked petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether 
 
 dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp 
 
 come along then said uncle vernon 
 
 he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled i dont understand 
 
 what dont you understand popkin asked petunia looking up at her son 
 
 dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry 
 
 why isnt he coming with us 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze when they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina 
 
 what said uncle vernon loudly 
 
 why isnt he coming too asked dudley 
 
 well he c doesnt want to said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding you dont want to do you 
 
 not in the slightest said harry 
 
 there you are uncle vernon told dudley now come on were off 
 
 he marched out of the room they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too 
 
 what now barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway 
 
 it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said but wheres he going to go 
 
 aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other it was clear that dudley was frightening them hestia jones broke the silence 
 
 but surely you know where your nephew is going she asked looking bewildered 
 
 certainly we know said vernon dursley hes off with some of your lot isnt he right dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry 
 
 again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow 
 
 off with some of our lot 
 
 hestia looked outraged harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter 
 
 its fine harry assured her it doesnt matter honestly 
 
 doesnt matter repeated hestia her voice rising considerably 
 
 dont these people realize what youve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement 
 
 er c no they dont said harry they think im a waste of space actually but im used to c 
 
 i dont think youre a waste of space 
 
 if harry had not seen dudleys lips move he might not have believed it as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red harry was embarrassed and astonished himself 
 
 well er thanks dudley 
 
 again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling you saved my life 
 
 not really said harry it was your soul the dementor would have taken 
 
 he looked curiously at his cousin they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into silence 
 
 aunt petunia burst into tears hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry sweet dudders she sobbed into his massive chest a lovely thank you 
 
 but he hasnt said thank you at all said hestia indignantly he only said he didnt think harry was a waste of space 
 
 yea but coming from dudley thats like i love you said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building 
 
 are we going or not roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door i thought we were on a tight schedule 
 
 yes cyes we are said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanged with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together we really must be off harry c 
 
 he tripped forward and wrung harrys hand with both of his own 
 
 c good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders 
 
 oh said harry right thanks 
 
 farwell harry said hestia also clasping his hand our thoughts go with you 
 
 i hope everythings okay said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley 
 
 oh im sure we shall end up the best of chums said diggle slightly waving his hat as he left the room hestia followed him 
 
 dudley gently released himself from his mothers clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic then dudley held out his large pink hand 
 
 blimey dudley said harry over aunt petunias renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you 
 
 dunno muttered dudley see you harry 
 
 yea said harry raking dudleys hand and shaking it maybe take care big d 
 
 dudley nearly smiled they lumbered from the room harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed 
 
 aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said well c and marched towards the door without looking at him 
 
 said harry 
 
 she stopped and looked back for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little of her head she hustled out of the room after he husband and son

lionfish nov chapter three the dursleys departingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared oh you 
 
 sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond he was still at the narrow fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledores eye it was not until his uncle bellowed boy that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him 
 
 you took you time roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs get down here i want a word 
 
 harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his pants pockets when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys they were dressed for packing uncle vernon in an old jacket and dudley harrys large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket 
 
 yes asked harry 
 
 sit down said uncle vernon harry raised his eyebrows please added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat harry sat he thought he knew what was coming his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movement with anxious expressions finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke 
 
 ive changed my mind he said 
 
 what a surprise said harry 
 
 dont you take that tone c began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down its all a lot of claptrap said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes ive decided i dont believe a word of it were staying put were not going anywhere 
 
 harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart harrys favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware that dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing 
 
 according to you vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we c petunia dudley and i c are in danger from c from c 
 
 some of my lot right said harry 
 
 well i dont believe it repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe its a plot to get the house 
 
 the house repeated harry what house 
 
 this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c 
 
 are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look 
 
 dont you dare c squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted 
 
 just in case youve forgotten said harry ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories 
 
 there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument 
 
 you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c 
 
 c voldemort said harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already this isnt a claim its fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c 
 
 vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon 
 
 c kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you 
 
 uncle vernons and harrys eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is 
 
 uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbors lawn mower stalled again 
 
 i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly 
 
 there is said harry surprised 
 
 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection 
 
 harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated 
 
 uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration 
 
 all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke 
 
 harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times 
 
 as ive told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister

 well hes taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c 
 
 if wed even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself 
 
 these accidents arent accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it c voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son 
 
 dudleys hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them 
 
 more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair c 
 
 all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley youve made your point c 
 
 i hope so said harry because once im seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help 
 
 there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudleys school i dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a leaf from heaven 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 high up in the clear pure air flew an angel with a flower 
 plucked from the garden of heaven as he was kissing the flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth in the 
 middle of a wood it immediately took root sprouted and sent out 
 shoots among the other plants what a ridiculous little shoot said one no one will recognize it not even the thistle nor the it must be a kind of garden plant said another and so they 
 sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden where are you coming said the tall thistles whose leaves were all armed with thorns it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way we are not here to support you 
 
 winter came and the plant was covered with snow but the snow 
 glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above 
 when spring came the plant appeared in full bloom a more 
 beautiful object than any other plant in the forest and now the 
 professor of botany presented himself one who could explain his 
 knowledge in black and white he examined and tested the plant but it did not belong to his system of botany nor could he possibly find out to what class it did belong it must be some degenerate species 
 said he i do not know it and it is not mentioned in any system 
 not known in any system repeated the thistles and the nettles 
 
 the large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the 
 remarks but they said not a word either good or bad which is the 
 wisest plan for those who are ignorant 
 
 there passed through the forest a poor innocent girl her heart 
 was pure and her understanding increased by her faith her chief 
 inheritance had been an old bible which she read and valued from its pages she heard the voice of god speaking to her and telling her to remember what was said of brethren when persons wished to injure her they imagined evil in their hearts but god turned it to good if we suffer wrongfully if we are misunderstood or despised we must think of him who was pure and holy and who prayed for those who nailed him to the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do 
 
 the girl stood still before the wonderful plant for the green 
 leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance and the flowers 
 glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames and the 
 harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed 
 within itself a deep fount of melody which thousands of years could 
 not exhaust with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious 
 work of god and bent down over one of the branches that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume then a light broke in on her mind and her heart expanded gladly would she have plucked a flower but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off 
 
 she knew it would so soon fade so she took only a single green 
 leaf carried it home and laid it in her bible where it remained 
 ever green fresh and unfading between the pages of the bible it 
 still lay when a few weeks afterwards that bible was laid under 
 the young head in her coffin a holy calm rested on her face 
 as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she now 
 stood in the presence of god 
 
 in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it 
 grew and became almost a tree and all the birds of passage bowed 
 themselves before it 
 
 that plant is a foreigner no doubt said the thistles and the 
 burdocks we can never conduct ourselves like that in this 
 country and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower 
 then came the swineherd he was collecting thistles and shrubs 
 to burn them for the ashes he pulled up the wonderful plant roots 
 and all and placed it in his bundle this will be as useful as any 
 he said so the plant was carried away 
 
 not long after the king of the country suffered from the 
 deepest melancholy he was diligent and industrious but employment 
 did him no good they read deep and learned books to him and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found but all to no purpose 
 
 then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world 
 and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy which 
 would relieve and cure him and that it was a plant of heavenly origin 
 which grew in the forest in the own dominions the messenger 
 described the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken 
 then said the swineherd i am afraid i carried this plant away 
 from the forest in my bundle and it has been burnt to ashes long ago 
 but i did not know any better 
 
 you did not know any better ignorance upon ignorance indeed 
 the poor swineherd took these words to heart for they were 
 addressed to him he knew not that there were others who were 
 equally ignorant not even a leaf of the plant could be found there 
 was one but it lay in the coffin of the dead no one knew anything 
 about it 
 
 then the king in his melancholy wandered out to the spot in 
 the wood here is where the plant stood he said it is a sacred 
 place then he ordered that the place should be surrounded with a 
 golden railing and a sentry stationed near it 
 
 the botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly 
 plant and for this he was loaded with gold which improved the 
 position of himself and his family 
 
 and this part is really the most pleasant part of the story for 
 the plant had disappeared and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever but the sentry said he had always been so

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a leaf from heaven 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 high up in the clear pure air flew an angel with a flower 
 plucked from the garden of heaven as he was kissing the flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth in the 
 middle of a wood it immediately took root sprouted and sent out 
 shoots among the other plants what a ridiculous little shoot said one no one will recognize it not even the thistle nor the it must be a kind of garden plant said another and so they 
 sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden where are you coming said the tall thistles whose leaves were all armed with thorns it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way we are not here to support you 
 
 winter came and the plant was covered with snow but the snow 
 glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above 
 when spring came the plant appeared in full bloom a more 
 beautiful object than any other plant in the forest and now the 
 professor of botany presented himself one who could explain his 
 knowledge in black and white he examined and tested the plant but it did not belong to his system of botany nor could he possibly find out to what class it did belong it must be some degenerate species 
 said he i do not know it and it is not mentioned in any system 
 not known in any system repeated the thistles and the nettles 
 
 the large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the 
 remarks but they said not a word either good or bad which is the 
 wisest plan for those who are ignorant 
 
 there passed through the forest a poor innocent girl her heart 
 was pure and her understanding increased by her faith her chief 
 inheritance had been an old bible which she read and valued from its pages she heard the voice of god speaking to her and telling her to remember what was said of brethren when persons wished to injure her they imagined evil in their hearts but god turned it to good if we suffer wrongfully if we are misunderstood or despised we must think of him who was pure and holy and who prayed for those who nailed him to the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do 
 
 the girl stood still before the wonderful plant for the green 
 leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance and the flowers 
 glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames and the 
 harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed 
 within itself a deep fount of melody which thousands of years could 
 not exhaust with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious 
 work of god and bent down over one of the branches that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume then a light broke in on her mind and her heart expanded gladly would she have plucked a flower but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off 
 
 she knew it would so soon fade so she took only a single green 
 leaf carried it home and laid it in her bible where it remained 
 ever green fresh and unfading between the pages of the bible it 
 still lay when a few weeks afterwards that bible was laid under 
 the young head in her coffin a holy calm rested on her face 
 as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she now 
 stood in the presence of god 
 
 in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it 
 grew and became almost a tree and all the birds of passage bowed 
 themselves before it 
 
 that plant is a foreigner no doubt said the thistles and the 
 burdocks we can never conduct ourselves like that in this 
 country and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower 
 then came the swineherd he was collecting thistles and shrubs 
 to burn them for the ashes he pulled up the wonderful plant roots 
 and all and placed it in his bundle this will be as useful as any

 ion 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 
 persons of the dialogue socrates ion 
 socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus 
 ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival 
 of asclepius 
 soc and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the 
 festival 
 ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers 
 soc and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed 
 ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates 
 soc well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the 
 panathenaea 
 ion and i will please heaven 
 soc i often envy the profession of a rhapsode 
 ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful 
 as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be 
 continually in the company of many good poets and especially of 
 homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand 
 him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be 
 envied and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the 
 meaning of the poet for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of 
 the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he 
 knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied 
 ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most 
 laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about 
 homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of 
 lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one 
 else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as 
 many 
 soc i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not 
 refuse to acquaint me with them 
 ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how 
 exquisitely i render homer i think that the homeridae should give 
 me a golden crown 
 soc i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of 
 him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a 
 question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to 
 homer only 
 ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough 
 soc are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree 
 ion yes in my opinion there are a good many 
 soc and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod 
 says about these matters in which they agree 
 ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree 
 soc but what about matters in which they do not agree for 
 example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have 
 something to say 
 ion very true 
 soc would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what 
 these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but 
 when they disagree 
 ion a prophet 
 soc and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret 
 them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
 ion clearly 
 soc but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and 
 not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the 
 same themes which all other poets handle is not war his great 
 argument and does he not speak of human society and of 
 intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the 
 gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what 
 happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of 
 gods and heroes are not these the themes of which homer sings 
 ion very true socrates 
 soc and do not the other poets sing of the same 
 ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer 
 soc what in a worse way 
 ion yes in a far worse 
 soc and homer in a better way 
 ion he is incomparably better 
 soc and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about 
 arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better 
 than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the 
 good speaker 
 ion yes 
 soc and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who 
 judges of the bad speakers 
 ion the same 
 soc and he will be the arithmetician 
 ion yes 
 soc well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food 
 when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest 
 will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from 
 him who recognizes the worse or the same 
 ion clearly the same 
 soc and who is he and what is his name 
 ion the physician 
 soc and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject 
 is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the 
 good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad 
 neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
 discussed 
 ion true 
 soc is not the same person skilful in both 
 ion yes 
 soc and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod 
 and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same 
 way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
 ion yes and i am right in saying so 
 soc and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the 
 inferior speakers to be inferior 
 ion that is true 
 soc then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is 
 equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself 
 acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those 
 who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of 
 the same things 
 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and 
 have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of 
 any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and 
 am all attention and have plenty to say 
 soc the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see 
 that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were 
 able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to 
 speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same 
 may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i 
 love to hear you wise men talk 
 soc o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us 
 so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you 
 sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the 
 truth for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this 
 which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man 
 has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and 
 bad is one and the same let us consider this matter is not the art of 
 painting a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and there are and have been many painters good and bad 
 ion yes 
 soc and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out 
 the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but 
 incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any 
 other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had 
 no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or 
 whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was 
 attentive and had plenty to say 
 ion no indeed i have never known such a person 
 soc or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful 
 in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius 
 the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any 
 individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were 
 produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
 ion no indeed no more than the other 
 soc and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among 
 or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who 
 was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or 
 phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to 
 speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
 ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am 
 conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking 
 that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any 
 other man but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the 
 reason of this 
 soc i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i 
 imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of 
 speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just 
 saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that 
 contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is 
 commonly known as the stone of heraclea this stone not only 
 attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of 
 attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces 
 of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a 
 long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from 
 the original stone in like manner the muse first of all inspires 
 men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
 persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all good poets 
 epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but 
 because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian 
 revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric 
 poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their 
 beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre 
 they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk 
 and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of 
 dionysus but not when they are in their right mind and the soul of 
 the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us 
 that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of 
 the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their 
 way from flower to flower and this is true for the poet is a light 
 and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he 
 has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no 
 longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless 
 and is unable to utter his oracles 
 many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the 
 actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they 
 do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to 
 utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when 
 inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise 
 another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is 
 good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does 
 the poet by power divine had he learned by rules of art he 
 would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all 
 and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as 
 his he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that 
 we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
 who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but 
 that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is 
 conversing with us and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking 
 instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would 
 care to remember but the famous paean which in every mouth 
 one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the 
 muses as he himself says for in this way the god would seem to 
 indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are 
 not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and 
 that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are 
 severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god intended 
 to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of 
 songs 
 am i not right ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words 
 touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine 
 inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us 
 soc and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
 ion there again you are right 
 soc then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
 ion precisely 
 soc i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask 
 of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
 the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of 
 odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and 
 casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing 
 at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are 
 you in your right mind are you not carried out of yourself and does 
 not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places 
 of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or 
 whatever may be the scene of the poem 
 ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly 
 confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and 
 when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
 soc well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice 
 or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
 crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears 
 sweeping or in the presence of more than twenty 
 thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging 
 him is he in his right mind or is he not 
 ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he 
 is not in his right mind 
 soc and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
 spectators 
 ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and 
 behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped 
 upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to 
 give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself 
 shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time 
 of payment arrives 
 soc do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
 which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from 
 one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
 intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them through 
 all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he 
 pleases and makes one man hang down from another thus there is a 
 vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses 
 who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings 
 which hang down from the muse and every poet has some muse 
 from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be 
 possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of 
 and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some 
 deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the 
 greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion 
 you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats 
 the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say 
 but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment 
 and your soul leaps within you have plenty to say for not by 
 art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by 
 divine inspiration and by possession 
 just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of 
 that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are 
 possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no 
 heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is 
 mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you 
 ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art 
 but by divine inspiration 
 ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever 
 have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only 
 when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of 
 him i am sure you would never think this to be the case 
 soc i should like very much to hear you but not until you have 
 answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do 
 you speak well not surely about every part 
 ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well 
 of that i can assure you 
 soc surely not about things in homer of which you have no 
 knowledge 
 ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge 
 soc why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for 
 example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat 
 them 
 ion i remember and will repeat them 
 soc tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he 
 bids him be careful of the turn at the in honour of 
 patroclus 
 ion he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them 
 and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken 
 the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet 
 so that the nave of the wheel may not even seem to 
 touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone 
 soc enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the 
 better judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the charioteer clearly 
 soc and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be 
 any other reason 
 ion no that will be the reason 
 soc and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a 
 certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not 
 know by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know 
 by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc and this is true of all the arts that which we know with 
 one art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior 
 question you admit that there are differences of arts 
 ion yes 
 soc you would argue as i should that when one art is of one 
 kind of knowledge and another of another they are different 
 ion yes 
 soc yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same 
 there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different 
 if they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here 
 are five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask 
 whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of 
 the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
 ion yes 
 soc tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this 
 holds universally must the same art have the same subject of 
 knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
 ion that is my opinion socrates 
 soc then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no 
 right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art 
 ion very true 
 soc then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
 reciting from homer you or the charioteer 
 ion the charioteer 
 soc why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the 
 charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different 
 matters 
 ion true 
 soc you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of 
 nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as 
 he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of 
 milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which 
 gives a relish to drink 
 now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
 medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the art of medicine 
 soc and when homer says 
 and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in 
 the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying 
 death among the ravenous fishes 
 will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to 
 judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
 ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman 
 soc come now suppose that you were to say to me since you 
 socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their 
 corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the 
 passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet 
 and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall 
 answer you for there are many such passages particularly in the 
 odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the 
 prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors 
 wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces 
 and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of 
 lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and 
 the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending 
 into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven 
 and an evil mist is spread abroad 
 and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example 
 in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says 
 as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen 
 a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge 
 bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he 
 yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which 
 carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall 
 from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude and the eagle 
 with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind 
 these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet 
 ought to consider and determine 
 ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so 
 soc yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from 
 the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
 the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know 
 homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which 
 relate to the rhapsode and the art and which the 
 rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men 
 ion all passages i should say socrates 
 soc not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you 
 were saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
 ion why what am i forgetting 
 soc do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode 
 to be different from the art of the charioteer 
 ion yes i remember 
 soc and you admitted that being different they would have different 
 subjects of knowledge 
 ion yes 
 soc then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the 
 rhapsode will not know everything 
 ion i should exclude certain things socrates 
 soc you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the 
 subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of 
 them will he know 
 ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and 
 what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and 
 what a subject 
 soc do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot 
 what the ruler of a vessel ought to say 
 ion no the pilot will know best 
 soc or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the 
 ruler of a sick man ought to say 
 ion he will not 
 soc but he will know what a slave ought to say 
 ion yes 
 soc suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know 
 better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
 infuriated cows 
 ion no he will not 
 soc but he will know what a ought to say about the 
 working of wool 
 ion no 
 soc at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when 
 exhorting his soldiers 
 ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be 
 sure to know 
 soc well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
 ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say 
 soc why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of 
 the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also 
 have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then 
 you would know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose 
 i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know 
 whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a 
 performer on the lyre what would you answer 
 ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman 
 soc and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit 
 that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a 
 horseman 
 ion yes 
 soc and in judging of the art do you judge of it as a 
 general or a rhapsode 
 ion to me there appears to be no difference between them 
 soc what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the 
 rhapsode and of the general is the same 
 ion yes one and the same 
 soc then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
 ion certainly socrates 
 soc and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
 ion no i do not say that 
 soc but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
 general 
 ion certainly 
 soc and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes 
 ion far the best socrates 
 soc and are you the best general ion 
 ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master 
 soc but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason 
 why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
 rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a 
 general 
 do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden 
 crown and do not want a general 
 ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the 
 ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need 
 a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think 
 that you have enough generals of your own 
 soc my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus 
 ion who may he be 
 soc one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their 
 general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and 
 heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the 
 command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after 
 they had shown their merit and will they not choose ion the 
 ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself 
 worthy were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is 
 no mean city 
 but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and 
 knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with 
 me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things 
 about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are 
 only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a 
 master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the 
 nature of it you have literally as many forms as proteus and now 
 you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus 
 become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in 
 the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
 homeric lore and if you have art then as i was saying in 
 falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not 
 dealing fairly with me but if as i believe you have no art but 
 speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his 
 inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only 
 say that you are inspired which do you prefer to be thought 
 dishonest or inspired 
 ion there is a great difference socrates between the two 
 alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
 soc then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute 
 to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art 
 the end

 ion 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 
 persons of the dialogue socrates ion 
 socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus 
 ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival 
 of asclepius 
 soc and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the 
 festival 
 ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers 
 soc and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed 
 ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates 
 soc well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the 
 panathenaea 
 ion and i will please heaven 
 soc i often envy the profession of a rhapsode 
 ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful 
 as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be 
 continually in the company of many good poets and especially of 
 homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand 
 him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be 
 envied and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the 
 meaning of the poet for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of 
 the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he 
 knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied 
 ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most 
 laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about 
 homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of 
 lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one 
 else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as 
 many 
 soc i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not 
 refuse to acquaint me with them 
 ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how 
 exquisitely i render homer i think that the homeridae should give 
 me a golden crown 
 soc i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of 
 him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a 
 question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to 
 homer only 
 ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough 
 soc are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree 
 ion yes in my opinion there are a good many 
 soc and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod 
 says about these matters in which they agree 
 ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree 
 soc but what about matters in which they do not agree for 
 example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have 
 something to say 
 ion very true 
 soc would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what 
 these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but 
 when they disagree 
 ion a prophet 
 soc and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret 
 them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
 ion clearly 
 soc but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and 
 not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the 
 same themes which all other poets handle is not war his great 
 argument and does he not speak of human society and of 
 intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the 
 gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what 
 happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of 
 gods and heroes are not these the themes of which homer sings 
 ion very true socrates 
 soc and do not the other poets sing of the same 
 ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer 
 soc what in a worse way 
 ion yes in a far worse 
 soc and homer in a better way 
 ion he is incomparably better 
 soc and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about 
 arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better 
 than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the 
 good speaker 
 ion yes 
 soc and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who 
 judges of the bad speakers 
 ion the same 
 soc and he will be the arithmetician 
 ion yes 
 soc well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food 
 when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest 
 will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from 
 him who recognizes the worse or the same 
 ion clearly the same 
 soc and who is he and what is his name 
 ion the physician 
 soc and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject 
 is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the 
 good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad 
 neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
 discussed 
 ion true 
 soc is not the same person skilful in both 
 ion yes 
 soc and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod 
 and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same 
 way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
 ion yes and i am right in saying so 
 soc and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the 
 inferior speakers to be inferior 
 ion that is true 
 soc then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is 
 equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself 
 acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those 
 who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of 
 the same things 
 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and 
 have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of 
 any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and 
 am all attention and have plenty to say 
 soc the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see 
 that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were 
 able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to 
 speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same 
 may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i 
 love to hear you wise men talk 
 soc o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us 
 so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you 
 sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the 
 truth for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this 
 which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man 
 has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and 
 bad is one and the same let us consider this matter is not the art of 
 painting a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and there are and have been many painters good and bad 
 ion yes 
 soc and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out 
 the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but 
 incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any 
 other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had 
 no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or 
 whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was 
 attentive and had plenty to say 
 ion no indeed i have never known such a person 
 soc or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful 
 in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius 
 the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any 
 individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were 
 produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
 ion no indeed no more than the other 
 soc and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among 
 or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who 
 was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or 
 phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to 
 speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
 ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am 
 conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking 
 that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any 
 other man but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the 
 reason of this 
 soc i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i 
 imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of 
 speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just 
 saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that 
 contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is 
 commonly known as the stone of heraclea this stone not only 
 attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of 
 attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces 
 of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a 
 long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from 
 the original stone in like manner the muse first of all inspires 
 men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
 persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all good poets 
 epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but 
 because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian 
 revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric 
 poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their 
 beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre 
 they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk 
 and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of 
 dionysus but not when they are in their right mind and the soul of 
 the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us 
 that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of 
 the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their 
 way from flower to flower and this is true for the poet is a light 
 and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he 
 has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no 
 longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless 
 and is unable to utter his oracles 
 many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the 
 actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they 
 do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to 
 utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when 
 inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise 
 another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is 
 good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does 
 the poet by power divine had he learned by rules of art he 
 would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all 
 and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as 
 his he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that 
 we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
 who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but 
 that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is 
 conversing with us and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking 
 instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would 
 care to remember but the famous paean which in every mouth 
 one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the 
 muses as he himself says for in this way the god would seem to 
 indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are 
 not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and 
 that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are 
 severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god intended 
 to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of 
 songs 
 am i not right ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words 
 touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine 
 inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us 
 soc and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
 ion there again you are right 
 soc then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
 ion precisely 
 soc i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask 
 of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
 the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of 
 odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and 
 casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing 
 at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are 
 you in your right mind are you not carried out of yourself and does 
 not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places 
 of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or 
 whatever may be the scene of the poem 
 ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly 
 confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and 
 when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
 soc well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice 
 or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
 crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears 
 sweeping or in the presence of more than twenty 
 thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging 
 him is he in his right mind or is he not 
 ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he 
 is not in his right mind 
 soc and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
 spectators 
 ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and 
 behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped 
 upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to 
 give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself 
 shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time 
 of payment arrives 
 soc do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
 which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from 
 one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
 intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them through 
 all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he 
 pleases and makes one man hang down from another thus there is a 
 vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses 
 who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings 
 which hang down from the muse and every poet has some muse 
 from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be 
 possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of 
 and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some 
 deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the 
 greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion 
 you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats 
 the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say 
 but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment 
 and your soul leaps within you have plenty to say for not by 
 art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by 
 divine inspiration and by possession 
 just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of 
 that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are 
 possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no 
 heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is 
 mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you 
 ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art 
 but by divine inspiration 
 ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever 
 have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only 
 when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of 
 him i am sure you would never think this to be the case 
 soc i should like very much to hear you but not until you have 
 answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do 
 you speak well not surely about every part 
 ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well 
 of that i can assure you 
 soc surely not about things in homer of which you have no 
 knowledge 
 ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge 
 soc why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for 
 example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat 
 them 
 ion i remember and will repeat them 
 soc tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he 
 bids him be careful of the turn at the in honour of 
 patroclus 
 ion he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them 
 and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken 
 the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet 
 so that the nave of the wheel may not even seem to 
 touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone 
 soc enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the 
 better judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the charioteer clearly 
 soc and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be 
 any other reason 
 ion no that will be the reason 
 soc and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a 
 certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not 
 know by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know 
 by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc and this is true of all the arts that which we know with 
 one art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior 
 question you admit that there are differences of arts 
 ion yes 
 soc you would argue as i should that when one art is of one 
 kind of knowledge and another of another they are different 
 ion yes 
 soc yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same 
 there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different 
 if they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here 
 are five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask 
 whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of 
 the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
 ion yes 
 soc tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this 
 holds universally must the same art have the same subject of 
 knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
 ion that is my opinion socrates 
 soc then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no 
 right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art 
 ion very true 
 soc then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
 reciting from homer you or the charioteer 
 ion the charioteer 
 soc why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the 
 charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different 
 matters 
 ion true 
 soc you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of 
 nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as 
 he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of 
 milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which 
 gives a relish to drink 
 now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
 medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the art of medicine 
 soc and when homer says 
 and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in 
 the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying 
 death among the ravenous fishes 
 will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to 
 judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
 ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman 
 soc come now suppose that you were to say to me since you 
 socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their 
 corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the 
 passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet 
 and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall 
 answer you for there are many such passages particularly in the 
 odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the 
 prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors 
 wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces 
 and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of 
 lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and 
 the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending 
 into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven 
 and an evil mist is spread abroad 
 and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example 
 in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says 
 as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen 
 a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge 
 bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he 
 yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which 
 carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall 
 from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude and the eagle 
 with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind 
 these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet 
 ought to consider and determine 
 ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so 
 soc yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from 
 the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
 the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know 
 homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which 
 relate to the rhapsode and the art and which the 
 rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men 
 ion all passages i should say socrates 
 soc not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you 
 were saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
 ion why what am i forgetting 
 soc do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode 
 to be different from the art of the charioteer 
 ion yes i remember 
 soc and you admitted that being different they would have different 
 subjects of knowledge 
 ion yes 
 soc then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the 
 rhapsode will not know everything 
 ion i should exclude certain things socrates 
 soc you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the 
 subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of 
 them will he know 
 ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and 
 what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and 
 what a subject 
 soc do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot 
 what the ruler of a vessel ought to say 
 ion no the pilot will know best 
 soc or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the 
 ruler of a sick man ought to say 
 ion he will not 
 soc but he will know what a slave ought to say 
 ion yes 
 soc suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know 
 better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
 infuriated cows 
 ion no he will not 
 soc but he will know what a ought to say about the 
 working of wool 
 ion no 
 soc at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when 
 exhorting his soldiers 
 ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be 
 sure to know 
 soc well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
 ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say 
 soc why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of 
 the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also 
 have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then 
 you would know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose 
 i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know 
 whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a 
 performer on the lyre what would you answer 
 ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman 
 soc and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit 
 that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a 
 horseman 
 ion yes 
 soc and in judging of the art do you judge of it as a 
 general or a rhapsode 
 ion to me there appears to be no difference between them 
 soc what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the 
 rhapsode and of the general is the same 
 ion yes one and the same 
 soc then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
 ion certainly socrates 
 soc and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
 ion no i do not say that 
 soc but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
 general 
 ion certainly 
 soc and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes 
 ion far the best socrates 
 soc and are you the best general ion 
 ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master 
 soc but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason 
 why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
 rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a 
 general 
 do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden 
 crown and do not want a general 
 ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the 
 ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need 
 a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think 
 that you have enough generals of your own 
 soc my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus 
 ion who may he be 
 soc one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their 
 general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and 
 heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the 
 command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after 
 they had shown their merit and will they not choose ion the 
 ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself 
 worthy were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is 
 no mean city 
 but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and 
 knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with 
 me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things 
 about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are 
 only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a 
 master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the 
 nature of it you have literally as many forms as proteus and now 
 you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus 
 become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in 
 the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
 homeric lore and if you have art then as i was saying in 
 falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not 
 dealing fairly with me but if as i believe you have no art but 
 speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his 
 inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only 
 say that you are inspired which do you prefer to be thought 
 dishonest or inspired 
 ion there is a great difference socrates between the two 
 alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
 soc then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute 
 to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art 
 the end

 book just man 
 chapter iii 
 
 a hard bishopric for a good bishop 
 the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms 
 the diocese of d is a fatiguing one there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen curacies vicarships and two hundred and auxiliary chapels 
 to visit all these is quite a task 
 the bishop managed to do it 
 he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains 
 the two old women accompanied him when the trip was too hard for them he went alone 
 one day he arrived at senez which is an ancient episcopal city he was mounted on an ass 
 his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage 
 the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes 
 some of the citizens were laughing around him 
 monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you 
 you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ 
 i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity 
 in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached 
 he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples 
 he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district 
 in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor he said 
 look at the people of briancon they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined therefore it is a country which is blessed by god 
 for a whole century there has not been a single murderer among them 
 in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun 
 if at the harvest season the father of a family has his son away on service in the army and his daughters at service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the women and to the poor field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his grain to his granary to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devolny a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years 
 well when the father of a family dies the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said 
 look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras 
 there are three thousand souls of them mon dieu it is like a little republic 
 neither judge nor bailiff is known there 
 the mayor does everything 
 he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounces sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras 
 do you know how they manage he said 
 since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher they have who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and instruct them 
 these teachers go to the fairs i have seen them there 
 they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat 
 those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have three pens 
 but what a disgrace to be ignorant 
 do like the people of queyras 
 thus he discoursed gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ 
 and being convinced himself he was persuasive
