 chapter iv 
 
 details concerning the of pontarlier 
 now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle letters to madame boischevron wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minuteness 
 this man paid no attention to any one 
 he ate with the voracity of a starving man 
 however after supper he said 
 monsieur le cure of the good god all this is far too good for me but i must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do 
 between ourselves the remark rather shocked me 
 my brother replied 
 they are more fatigued than i 
 no returned the man they have more money 
 you are poor i see that plainly 
 you cannot be even a curate 
 are you really a cure 
 ah if the good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure 
 the good god is more than just said my brother 
 a moment later he added 
 monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarlier that you are going 
 with my road marked out for me 
 i think that is what the man said 
 then he went on 
 i must be on my way by daybreak travelling is hard if the nights are cold the days are hot 
 you are going to a good country said my brother 
 during the revolution my family was ruined 
 i took refuge in at first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands my will was good 
 i found plenty to occupy me 
 one has only to choose there are paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copper works twenty iron foundries at least four of which situated at lods at chatillon at audincourt and at beure are tolerably large 
 i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned 
 then he interrupted himself and addressed me 
 have we not some relatives in those parts my dear sister 
 i replied 
 we did have some among others m de lucenet who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime 
 yes resumed my brother but in one had no longer any relatives one had only arms 
 i worked 
 they have in the country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister it is their which they call fruitieres 
 then my brother while urging the man to eat explained to him with great minuteness what these fruitieres of pontarlier were that they were divided into two classes 
 the big barns which belong to the rich and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer and the associated fruitieres which belong to the poor these are the peasants of who hold their cows in common and share the proceeds they engage the services of a whom they call the grurin the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day and marks the quantity on a double tally 
 it is towards the end of april that the work of the begins it is towards the middle of june that the drive their cows to the mountains 
 the man recovered his animation as he ate 
 my brother made him drink that good mauves wine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive 
 my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me 
 he recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him a refuge 
 one thing struck me this man was what i have told you 
 well neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind the man of what he was nor of what my brother was to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passage might remain behind 
 this might have appeared to any one else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future my brother did not even ask him from what country he came nor what was his history 
 for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it 
 to such a point did he carry it that at one time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise a gentle labor near heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man by dint of reflection i think i have comprehended what was passing in my heart 
 he was thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe if only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way 
 is not this indeed to understand charity well 
 is there not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions and is not the truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all 
 it has seemed to me that this might have been my private thought in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he gave no sign of them from beginning to end even to me he was the same as he is every evening and he supped with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m gedeon le provost or with the curate of the parish 
 towards the end when he had reached the figs there came a knock at the door 
 it was mother gerbaud with her little one in her arms my brother kissed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud 
 the man was not paying much heed to anything then 
 he was no longer talking and he seemed very much fatigued 
 after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure my brother said grace then he turned to the man and said to him you must be in great need of your bed 
 madame magloire cleared the table very promptly 
 i understood that we must retire in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep and we both went up stairs 
 nevertheless i sent madame magloire down a moment later to carry to the bed a goat skin from the black forest which was in my room 
 the nights are frigid and that keeps one warm it is a pity that this skin is old all the hair is falling out my brother bought it while he was in germany at tottlingen near the sources of the danube as well as the little knife which i use at table 
 madame magloire returned immediately 
 we said our prayers in the where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to our own chambers without saying a word to each other

 the empire strikes back 
 v 
 
 no one on hoth heard the sound at first it was simply too distant to carry abovethe whining winds besides the rebel troopers fighting the cold as they preparedfor battle were too busy to really listen 
 in the snow trenches rebel officers screamed out their orders to makethemselves heard above the winds troopers hurried to carry out theircommands running through the snow with heavy bazookalike weapons on theirshoulders and lodging those death rays along the icy rims of the trenches 
 the rebel power generators near the gun towers began popping buzzing andcrackling with deafening bursts of electrical to supply the vastunderground complex but above all this activity and noise a strange sound could beheard an ominous thumping that was coming nearer and was beginning to shake thefrozen ground when it was close enough to attract the attention of an officer hestrained to see through the storm looking for the source of the heavy rhythmicpounding other men looked up from their work and saw what looked like a numberof moving specks through the blizzard the small dots seemed to be advancing at aslow yet steady pace churning up clouds of snow as they moved toward the rebelbase 
 the officer raised his electrobinoculars and focused on the approaching must have been dozen of them resolutely advancing through the snow lookinglike creatures out of some uncharted past but they were machines each of themstalking like enormous ungulates on four jointed legs 
 walkers 
 with a shock of recognition the officer identified the all terrainarmored transports each machine was formidably armed with cannons placed onits foreside like the horns of some prehistoric beast moving like mechanizedpachyderms the walkers emitted deadly fire from their turnstile guns and cannons 
 the officer grabbed his comlink rogue leaderincoming point zerothree 
 echo station on our way 
 even as luke skywalker replied an explosion sprayed ice and snow around theofficer and his men the walkers already had them within range thetroopers knew their job was to divert attention while the transport ships were none of the rebel soldiers was prepared to die under the feet or weapons of thesehorrible machines 
 brilliant billows of orange and yellow flames exploded from the walker the rebel troopers aimed their weapons at the walkers each soldier feelingicy unseen fingers pierce his body 
 of the twelve snowspeeders four took the lead soaring at full throttle as theymoved toward the enemy one all terrain armored transport machine fired barelymissing the banking craft a burst of gunfire blew another speeder into a ball offlaming oblivion that lit up the sky 
 luke saw the explosion of his first casualty as he looked from hiscockpit window angrily luke fired his guns at a walker only to receive ahail of imperial fire power that shook his speeder in a barrage of flak 
 regaining control of his ship luke was joined by another snowspeeder roguethree they swarmed like insects around the relentlessly stomping walkers as otherspeeders continued to exchange fire with the imperial assault machines rogueleader and rogue three flitted alongside the lead walker then moved away fromeach other both banking to the right 
 luke saw the horizon tilt as he maneuvered his speeder between the legs and soared out from under the monster machine bringing his speederback to horizontal flight the young commander contacted his companion leader to rogue three 
 copy rogue leader acknowledged wedge the pilot of rogue three 
 wedge luke called into his comlink split your squad into pairs then banked and turned while ship moved off in the oppositedirection with another rebel craft 
 the walkers firing all cannons continued their march across the snow insideone of the assault machines two imperial pilots had spotted the rebel against the white field the pilots began to maneuver the walkertoward the guns when they noticed a lone snowspeeder making a reckless chargedirectly toward their main viewport guns blazing a huge explosion flashed outsidethe impenetrable window and dissipated as the snowspeeder roaring through thesmoke disappeared overhead 
 as luke soared up and away from the walker he looked back that armor istoo strong for blasters he thought there must be some other way of attacking thesehorrors something other than fire power for a moment luke thought of some ofthe simple tactics a farm boy might employ against a wild beast then turning hissnowspeeder for yet another run against the walkers he made a decision 
 rogue group he called into his comlink use your harpoons and tow for the legs our only hope of stopping them hobbie are you still withme 
 the reassuring voice immediately responded yes sir 
 well stick close now 
 as he leveled his ship luke was grimly determined to glide in tight formationwith hobbie together they veered dropping nearer surface 
 in cockpit his gunner dack was jostled by the abrupt movement of thecraft trying to keep his grip on the rebel harpoon gun in his hand he luke i seem to find my restraints 
 explosions rocked ship tossing it about violently in the enveloping the window he could see another walker that appeared to be unaffected bythe full fire power of the rebel attack speeders this lumbering machine nowbecame target as he flew moving in a descending arc the walker was firingdirectly at him creating a wall of laser bolts and flak 
 just hang on dack he yelled over the explosions and get ready to fire thattow cable 
 another great blast shook snowspeeder he fought to regain control asthe ship wobbled in its flight luke began to sweat profusely despite the cold as hedesperately attempted to right his plunging ship but the horizon still spun in frontof him 
 stand by dack almost there are you okay 
 dack answer luke managed to turn and saw that speeder wasmaintaining its course next to him as they evaded the explosions bursting around craned his head around and saw dack blood streaming from his forehead slumpedagainst the controls 
 dack 
 on the ground the gun towers near the rebel power generators blasted away atthe walking imperial machines but with no apparent effect imperial weaponsbombarded the area all around them blasting the snow skyward almost blinding theirhuman targets with the continuous onslaught the officer who had first seen theincredible machines and fought alongside his men was one of the first to be cut downby a rays troops rushed to his aid but save much of his blood had already spilled making a scarlet stain against the snow 
 more rebel fire power blasted from one of the dishlike guns that had beenerected near the power generators despite these tremendous explosions thewalkers continued to march another speeder made a heroic dive between a pair ofthe walkers only to be caught by fire from one of the machines that exploded it into agreat ball of rippling flames 
 the surface explosions made the walls of the ice hangar tremble causing deepcracks to spread 
 han solo and chewbacca were working frantically to complete their welding they worked it became obvious that the widening cracks would soon bring theentire ice ceiling smashing down upon them 
 first chance we get han said giving this crate a complete he knew that first he would have to get the millennium falcon out of this whitehell 
 even as he and the wookiee labored on the ship enormous pieces of ice brokenloose by the explosions came tumbling down throughout the underground leia moved quickly trying to avoid the falling frozen chunks as she soughtshelter in the rebel command center 
 not sure we can protect two transports at a time general rieekan told heras she entered the chamber 
 risky she answered but our holding action is faltering leia realizedthat the transport launchings were taking too much time and that the procedure had tobe hastened 
 rieekan issued a command through his comlink launch patrol proceed withaccelerated departures 
 as the general gave his order leia looked toward an aide and said beginclearing the remaining ground stuff but she knew that their escape dependedcompletely on rebel success in the battle above 
 inside the cold and cramped cockpit of the lead imperial walker general veersmoved between his pilots what is the distance to the powergenerators 
 without looking away from the control panel one of the pilots 
 satisfied general veers reached for an electrotelescope and peered through theviewfinder to focus on the power generators and the rebel soldiersfighting to save them suddenly the walker began to rock violently under a barrageof rebel gunfire as he was propelled backward veers saw his pilot scramblingover the controls to keep the machine from toppling over 
 the rogue three snowspeeder had just attacked the lead walker its hooted with a loud rebel shout of victory as he saw the damage his guns hadcaused 
 other snowspeeders passed wedge racing in the opposite direction he steeredhis craft on a direct course toward another walking death machine as heapproached the monster wedge shouted to his gunner activate harpoon 
 the gunner pressed the firing switch as his pilot daringly maneuvered their craftthrough the legs immediately the harpoon whooshed from the rear of thespeeder a long length of cable unwinding behind it 
 cable out the gunner yelled let her go 
 wedge saw the harpoon plunge into one of the metal legs the cable stillconnected to his snowspeeder he checked his controls then brought the speederaround in front of the imperial machine making an abrupt turn wedge guided hisship around one of the hind legs the cable banding around it like a metallic lariat 
 so far thought wedge plan was working now all he had to do was flyhis speeder around to the tail end of the walker wedge caught a glimpse of rogueleader as he carried out the maneuver 
 cable out shouted the gunner again as wedge flew their craftalongside the walker close to the metal hull gunnerdepressed another switch and released the cable from the rear of the snowspeeder 
 the speeder zoomed away and wedge laughed as he looked down at the resultsof their efforts the walker was awkwardly struggling to continue on its way but therebel cable had completely entangled its legs finally it leaned to one side andcrashed against the ground its impact stirring up a cloud of ice and snow 
 rogue leaderone down luke wedge announced to the pilot of hiscompanion speeder 
 i see it wedge commander skywalker answered good work 
 in the trenches rebel troops cheered in triumph when they saw the assaultmachine topple an officer leaped from his snow trench and signaled his out of the trench he led his troopers in a boisterous charge against the fallenwalker reaching the great metallic hulk before a single imperial soldier could pullhimself free 
 the rebels were about to enter the walker when it suddenly exploded fromwithin hurtling great jagged chunks of torn metal at them the impact of the blastflinging the stunned troops back against the snow 
 luke and zev could see the destruction of the walker as they flew from right to left to avoid the flak bursting around them when they finallyleveled off their craft were shaken by explosions from the cannons 
 steady rogue two luke said looking over at the snowspeeder flying parallelto his own ship set harpoon cover for you 
 but there was another explosion this one damaging the front section of the pilot could barely see through the engulfing cloud of smoke that foggedhis windshield he fought to keep his ship on a horizontal path but more blasts bythe enemy made it rock violently 
 his view had become so obscured that it until zev was directly in the lineof fire that he saw the massive image of another imperial walker rogue pilotfelt an instant of pain then his craft spewing smoke and hurtling on acollision course with the walker suddenly erupted in flames amid a burst of cannonfire very little of zev or his ship remained to hit the ground 
 luke saw the disintegration and was sickened by the loss of yet another he let himself dwell on his grief especially now when so many otherlives depended on his steady leadership 
 he looked around desperately then spoke into his three set your harpoon and follow me on the nextpass 
 as he spoke luke was hit hard by a terrific explosion that ripped through hisspeeder he struggled with the controls in a futile attempt to keep the small craftunder control a chill of fear swept over him when he noticed the dense twistingfunnel of black smoke pouring from his aft section he realized then thatthere was no way his damaged speeder could remain aloft and to make matterseven worse a walker loomed directly in his path 
 luke struggled with the controls as his ship plunged toward the ground leaving atrail of smoke and flames behind by then the heat in the cockpit was nearlyunbearable flames were beginning to leap about inside the speeder and werecoming uncomfortably close to luke he finally brought his ship down to skid andcrash into the snow just a few meters away from one of the walking imperialmachines 
 after impact luke struggled to pull himself from the cockpit and looked withhorror at the looming figure of the approaching walker 
 gathering all his strength luke quickly squeezed himself from under the twistedmetal of the control board and moved up against the top of his cockpit somehow hemanaged to open the hatch halfway and climbed out of the ship with eachelephantine step of the oncoming walker the speeder shook violently luke had notrealized just how enormous these horrors were until unprotected by theshelter of his craft he saw one up close 
 then he remembered dack and returned to try to pull his lifeless formfrom the wrecked speeder but luke had to give up the body was too tightlywedged in the cockpit and the walker was now almost upon him braving theflames luke reached into his speeder and grabbed the harpoon gun 
 he gazed at the advancing mechanical behemoth and suddenly had an idea hereached back inside the cockpit of the speeder and groped for a land mine attached tothe interior with a great effort he stretched his fingers and firmly grasped themine 
 luke leaped away from his vehicle just as the towering machine lifted a massivefoot and planted it firmly on the snowspeeder crushing it flat 
 luke crouched underneath the walker moving with it to avoid its slow his head he felt the cold wind slap against his face as he studied vast underbelly 
 as he ran along under the machine luke aimed his harpoon gun and fired apowerful magnet attached to a long thin cable was ejected from the gun and firmlyattached itself to the underbelly 
 still running luke tanked on the cable testing to make sure its strength wassufficient to sustain his weight then he attached the cable drum to the buckle of hisutility belt allowing its mechanism to pull him up off the ground now danglingfrom the underbelly luke could see the remaining walkers and two rebelsnowspeeders continuing the battle as they soared through fiery explosions 
 he climbed up to the hull where he had observed a small cutting it open with his laser sword luke pulled open the hatch threw in theland mine and made a rapid descent along the cable as he reached the end lukedropped hard onto the snow and became unconscious his inert body was nearlybrushed by one of the hind fee 
 as the walker passed over and away from him a muffled explosion tore at itsinsides suddenly the tremendous bulk of the mechanical beast exploded at theseams machinery and pieces of hull flying in every direction the imperial assaultmachine crumbled into a smoking motionless heap coming to rest upon whatremained of its four stiltlike legs

 chapter xix 
 
 at the end of the table the talk grew more and more animated the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief 
 and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshin he has stopped cackle and i fear it will be our turn next 
 the colonel was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian he resented remark 
 it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german accent for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter 
 then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto 
 and the wish which constitutes the sole and absolute aim to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose 
 zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval 
 le proverbe jerome jerome do not roam but turn spindles at home said shinshin puckering his brows and smiling cela nous convient a merveille suvorov now he knew what he was about yet they beat him a plate couture and where are we to find suvorovs now je vous demande un peu said he continually changing from french to russian 
 do you know the proverb 
 that suits us down to the ground 
 hollow 
 i just ask you that 
 ve must vight to the last of our plood said the colonel thumping the table and ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as he dwelt particularly on the word possible as he ended again turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it and an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel 
 i am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concluded conscious as were others after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward 
 what you said just now was splendid said his partner julie 
 sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking 
 pierre listened to the speech and nodded approvingly 
 fine said he 
 the young a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the table 
 what are you making such a noise about over there marya deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table what are you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are you exciting yourself do you think the french are here 
 i am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile 
 all about the war the count shouted down the table you know my going marya dmitrievna my son is going 
 i have four sons in the army but still i fret it is all in hands you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle replied marya deep voice which easily carried the whole length of the table 
 true 
 once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and the at the other 
 you ask little brother was saying i know you ask 
 i will replied natasha 
 her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what was coming and turning to her mother 
 mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice audible the whole length of the table 
 what is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head 
 the conversation was hushed 
 mamma what sweets are we going to have and voice sounded still more firm and resolute 
 the countess tried to frown but could not marya dmitrievna shook her fat finger 
 cossack she said threateningly 
 most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the elders 
 you had better take care said the countess 
 mamma what sweets are we going to have natasha again cried boldly with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part 
 sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter 
 you see i have asked whispered natasha to her little brother and to pierre glancing at him again 
 ice pudding but you get any said marya dmitrievna 
 natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even marya dmitrievna 
 marya dmitrievna what kind of ice pudding i like ice cream 
 carrot ices 
 no what kind marya dmitrievna what kind she almost screamed i want to know 
 marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests joined in everyone laughed not at marya answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat marya dmitrievna in this fashion 
 natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the band again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests returned to the drawing room and to the study

 chapter 
 
 a letter edged with black announced the day of my return isabella was dead and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter and arrange a room and other accommodations for his youthful nephew catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellences of her real cousin the evening of their expected arrival came since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs and now attired in her new black thing her death impressed her with no definite obliged me by constant worrying to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them 
 linton is just six months younger than i am she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf under shadow of the trees how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow aunt isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair it was lighter than flaxen and quite as fine i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box and often thought what pleasure it would be to see its owner oh i am papa dear dear papa come ellen let us run come run 
 she ran and returned and ran again many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path and tried to wait patiently but that was impossible she be still a minute 
 how long they are she exclaimed ah i see some dust on the road they are coming no when will they be here may we not go a little a mile ellen only just half a mile do say yes to that clump of birches at the turn 
 i refused staunchly at length her suspense was ended the travelling carriage rolled in sight miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her face looking from the window he descended nearly as eager as herself and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton he was asleep in a corner wrapped in a warm cloak as if it had been winter a pale delicate effeminate boy who might have been taken for my younger brother so strong was the resemblance but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had the latter saw me looking and having shaken hands advised me to close the door and leave him undisturbed for the journey had fatigued him cathy would fain have taken one glance but her father told her to come on and they walked together up the park while i hastened before to prepare the servants 
 now darling said mr linton addressing his daughter as they halted at the bottom of the front steps your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are and he has lost his mother remember a very short time since therefore expect him to play and run about with you directly and harass him much by talking let him be quiet this evening at least will you 
 yes yes papa answered catherine but i do want to see him and he once looked out 
 the carriage stopped and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his uncle 
 this is your cousin cathy linton he said putting their little hands together fond of you already and mind you grieve her by crying tonight try to be cheerful now the travelling is at an end and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please 
 let me go to bed then answered the boy shrinking from salute and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears 
 come come a good child i whispered leading him in 
 make her weep how sorry she is for you 
 i do not know whether it were sorrow for him but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself and returned to her father all three entered and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready i proceeded to remove cap and mantle and placed him on a chair by the table but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh my master inquired what was the matter 
 i sit on a chair sobbed the boy 
 go to the sofa then and ellen shall bring you some tea answered his uncle patiently 
 he had been greatly tried during the journey i felt convinced by his fretful ailing charge linton slowly trailed himself off and lay down cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side at first she sat silent but that could not last she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin as she would have him to be and she commenced stroking his curls and kissing his cheek and offering him tea in her saucer like a baby this pleased him for he was not much better he dried his eyes and lightened into a faint smile 
 oh do very well said the master to me after watching them a minute very well if we can keep him ellen the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon and by wishing for strength gain it 
 ay if we can keep him i mused to myself and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that and then i thought however will that weakling live at wuthering heights between his father and hareton what playmates and instructors be our doubts were presently decided even earlier than i expected i had just taken the children upstairs after tea was finished and seen linton would not suffer me to leave him till that was the had come down and was standing by the table in the hall lighting a bedroom candle for mr edgar when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr servant joseph was at the door and wished to speak with the master 
 i shall ask him what he wants first i said in considerable trepidation a very unlikely hour to be troubling people and the instant they have returned from a long journey i think the master can see him 
 joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words and now presented himself in the hall he was donned in his sunday garments with his most sanctimonious and sourest face and holding his hat in one hand and his stick in the other he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat 
 good evening joseph i said coldly what business brings you here tonight 
 maister linton aw mun spake tull he answered waving me disdainfully aside 
 mr linton is going to bed unless you have something particular to say sure he hear it now i continued you had better sit down in there and entrust your message to me 
 which is his rahm pursued the fellow surveying the range of closed doors 
 i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation so very reluctantly i went up to the library and announced the unseasonable visitor advising that he should be dismissed till next day mr linton had no time to empower me to do so for joseph mounted close at my heels and pushing into the apartment planted himself at the far side of the table with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick and began in an elevated tone as if anticipating opposition 
 heathcliff has send me for his lad and aw goa back bout him 
 edgar linton was silent a minute an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features he would have pitied the child on his own account but recalling hopes and fears and anxious wishes for her son and her commendations of him to his care he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up and searched in his heart how it might be avoided no plan offered itself the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory there was nothing left but to resign him however he was not going to rouse him from his sleep 
 tell mr heathcliff he answered calmly that his son shall come to wuthering heights tomorrow he is in bed and too tired to go the distance now you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired him to remain under my guardianship and at present his health is very precarious 
 noa said joseph giving a thud with his prop on the floor and assuming an authoritative air noa that manes nowt hathecliff maks noa cahnt uh t mother nur yah norther bud hev his lad und aw mun tak nah yah knaw 
 you shall not tonight answered linton decisively walk downstairs at once and repeat to your master what i have said ellen show him down go 
 and aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm he rid the room of him and closed the door 
 varrah weell shouted joseph as he slowly drew off tuhmorn come hisseln un thrust him aht if yah darr

 while these things were happening at home amy was having hard times at aunt she felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home aunt march never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the well behaved little girl pleased her very much and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her children though she think it proper to confess it she really did her best to make amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way but aunt march had not this gift and she worried amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence so she took amy by the hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago a process which carried dismay to soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider 
 she had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was not a speck escaped aunt eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit then polly had to be fed the lap dog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair after these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and she enjoy it 
 laurie came every day and wheedled aunt march till amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page then patchwork or towels appeared and amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime the evenings were the worst of all for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to be intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two 
 if it had not been for laurie and old esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible he pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made mop bark by pecking at him while madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird then she could not endure the dog a fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day the cook was the old coachman was deaf and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady 
 esther was a frenchwoman who had lived as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her her real name was estelle but aunt march ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion she took a fancy to mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in france when amy sat with her while she got up laces she also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for aunt march hoarded like a magpie chief delight was an indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique to examine and arrange these things gave amy great satisfaction especially the jewel cases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day her diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn uncle big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay aunt wedding ring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all 
 which would mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked esther wo always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables 
 i like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and fond of necklaces they are so becoming i should choose this if i might replied amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same 
 i too covet that but not as a necklace ah no to me it is a rosary and as such i should use it like a good catholic said esther eyeing the handsome thing wistfully 
 is it meant to use as you use the string of wooden beads hanging over your glass asked amy 
 truly yes to pray with it would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou 
 you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied i wish i could 
 if mademoiselle was a catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom i served before madame she had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble 
 would it be right for me to do so too asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it 
 it would be excellent and charming and i shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it say nothing to madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear god preserve your sister 
 esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good 
 i wish i knew where all these pretty things would go when aunt march dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one 
 to you and your sisters i know it madame confides in me i witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered esther smiling 
 how nice but i wish let us have them now procrastination is not agreeable observed amy taking a last look at the diamonds 
 it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things the first one who is affianced will have the pearls madame has said it and i have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for madame approves your good behavior and charming manners 
 do you think so oh be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring ever so much prettier than kitty i do like aunt march after all and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it 
 from that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the rooms she thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that madame would never know it nor care if she did it was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart on the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear god to preserve her sister esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for protestant prayers 
 the little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe home nest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children she missed her help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly but amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it in her firsteffort at being very very good she decided to make her will as aunt march had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided it cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old jewels 
 during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from esther as to certain legal terms and when the frenchwoman had signed her name amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie whom she wanted as a second witness as it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took polly with her for company in this room there was a wardrobe full of costumes with which esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately curtsies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears so busy was she on this day that she did not hear ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat she was obliged to walk carefully for she had on highheeled shoes and as laurie told jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with polly sidilng and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim we fine get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha ha 
 having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty laurie tapped and was graciously received 
 sit down and rest while i put these things away then i want to consult you about a very serious matter said amy when she had shown her splendor and driven polly into a corner that bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while laurie seated himself astride a chair yesterday when aunt was asleep and i was trying to be as still as a mouse polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so i went to let him out and found a big spider there i poked it out and it ran under the bookcase polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye come out and take a walk my dear i help laughing which made poll swear and aunt woke up and scolded us both 
 did the spider accept the old invitation asked laurie yawning 
 yes out it came and away ran polly frightened to death and scrambled up on chair calling out catch her catch her catch her as i chased the spider 
 a lie oh lor cried the parrot pecking at toes 
 wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked allyluyer bless your buttons dear 
 now ready said amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket i want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right i felt i ought to do it for life is uncertain and i want any ill feeling over my tomb 
 laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling 
 
 
 my last will and testiment 
 
 i amy curtis march being in my sane mind go give and bequeethe all my earthly 
 to my father my best pictures sketches maps and works of art including frames also my to do what he likes with 
 to my mother all my clothes except the blue apron with my likeness and my medal with much love 
 to my dear sister margaret i give my turkquoise ring if i get it also my green box with the doves on it also my piece of real lace for her neck and my sketch of her as a memorial of her little girl 
 to jo i leave my breastpin the one mended with sealing wax also my bronze lost the my most precious plaster rabbit because i am sorry i burned up her story 
 to beth if she lives after me i give my dolls and the little bureau my fan my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well and i herewith also leave her my regret that i ever made fun of old joanna 
 to my friend and neighbor theodore laurence i bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio my clay model of a horse though he did say it any neck also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes noter dame is the best 
 to our venerable benefactor mr laurence i leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family especially beth 
 i wish my favorite playmate kitty bryant to have the blue silk apron and my ring with a kiss 
 to hannah i give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork i leave hoping she will remember me when it you see 
 and now having disposed of my most valuable property i hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead i forgive everyone and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound amen 
 to this will and testiment i set my hand and seal on this th day of nov anni domino 
 
 amy curtis march 
 
 witnesses 
 estelle valnor 
 theodore laurence 
 
 the last name was written in pencil and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly 
 what put it into your head did anyone tell you about giving away her things asked laurie soberly as amy laid a bit of red tape with sealing wax a taper and a standish before him 
 she explained and then asked anxiously what about beth 
 sorry i spoke but as i did tell you she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa she never thought of a will 
 laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper face was full of trouble but she only said people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes 
 yes codicils they call them 
 put one in mine then that i wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends i forgot it but i want it done though it will spoil my looks 
 laurie added it smiling at last and greatest sacrifice then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials but when he came to go amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips is there really any danger about beth 
 afraid there is but we must hope for the best so cry dear and laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting 
 when he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the servant of lord voldemortcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though received a huge electric shock 
 
 i found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at chest very useful potter i thank you 
 
 snape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph wondering perhaps how i knew you were here he said his eyes glittering just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i didlucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sight 
 
 severus lupin began but snape overrode him 
 
 told the headmaster again and again that helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout 
 
 severus making a mistake said lupin urgently you heard everything i can explain sirius is not here to kill harry 
 
 two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes thishe was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupina tame werewolf 
 
 you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkaban 
 
 bang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of wand and twisted themselves around mouth wrists and ankles he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rage black started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between eyes 
 
 give me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i will 
 
 black stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred 
 
 harry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believe he glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermione however took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor snape it hurt to hear what got to say it 
 
 miss granger you are already facing suspension from this school snape spat you potter and weasley are in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tongue 
 
 but if if there was a mistake 
 
 keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged talk about what you understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at face hermione fell silent 
 
 vengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch you 
 
 the on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle he jerked his head at ron come quietly 
 
 up to the castle said snape silkily i think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow be very pleased to see you blackpleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresayi 
 
 what little color there was in face left it 
 
 you got to hear me out he croaked the rat look at the rat 
 
 but there was a mad glint in eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reason 
 
 come on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands drag the werewolf perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too 
 
 before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door 
 
 get out of the way potter in enough trouble already snarled snape if i been here to save your skin 
 
 professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year harry said been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why he just finish me off then 
 
 ask me to fathom the way a mind works hissed snape get out of the way potter 
 
 pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you even listen 
 
 silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked looking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if killed you have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potter 
 
 harry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wand 
 
 expelliarmus he yelled except that his the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked out 
 
 harry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanks 
 
 you have done that said black looking at harry 
 
 you should have left him to me 
 
 harry avoided eyes he sure even now that done the right thing 
 
 we attacked a teacherwe attacked a teacher hermione whimpered staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh going to be in so much trouble 
 
 lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them 
 
 thank you harry he said 
 
 still not saying i believe you he told lupin 
 
 then time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy give me peter please now 
 
 ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest 
 
 come off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean he looked up at harry and hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat there are millions of rats he supposed to know which one he is after if he was locked up in azkaban 
 
 you know sirius a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he was 
 
 black put one of his hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others 
 
 it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on shoulder was scabbers 
 
 how did you get this lupin asked black thunderstruck 
 
 fudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page on this shoulderi knew him at oncehow many times had i seen him transform and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwartsto where harry was 
 
 my god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front paw 
 
 what about it said ron defiantly 
 
 got a toe missing said black 
 
 of course lupin breathed so simpleso brillianthe cut it off himself 
 
 just before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that betrayed lily and james then before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself and sped down into the sewer with the other rats 
 
 you ever hear ron said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his finger 
 
 look scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something been in my family for ages right 
 
 twelve years in fact said lupin you ever wonder why he was living so long 
 
 we been taking good care of him said ron 
 
 not looking too good at the moment though is he said lupin guess been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose again 
 
 been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bed 
 
 but that right harry thought suddenlyscabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks ever since return from egyptsince the time when black had escaped 
 
 this cat mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked fluffy head the most intelligent of his kind ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted mefinally i managed to communicate to him what i was after and been helping me 
 
 what do you mean breathed hermione 
 
 he tried to bring peter to me but he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for meas i understand it he took them from a bedside table 
 
 brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurdand yet 
 
 but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it croaked black this cat crookshanks did you call him told me peter had left blood on the sheetsi supposed he bit himselfwell faking his own death had worked once 
 
 these words jolted harry to his senses 
 
 and why did he fake his death he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents 
 
 no said lupin harry 
 
 and now come to finish him off 
 
 yes i have said black with an evil look at scabbers 
 
 then i let snape take you harry shouted 
 
 harry said lupin hurriedly you see all this time thought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down but it was the other way around you see peter betrayed your mother and father sirius tracked peter down 
 
 not true harry yelled he was their he said so before you turned up he said he killed them 
 
 he was pointing at black who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright 
 
 harryi as good as killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as instead of to blame i know itthe night they died arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safe but when i arrived at his hiding place gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodiesi realized what peter donewhat done 
 
 his voice broke he turned away 
 
 enough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that rat 
 
 what are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron asked lupin tensely 
 
 force him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it hurt him 
 
 ron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turning his tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius said lupin 
 
 black had already retrieved wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face 
 
 together he said quietly 
 
 i think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one two three 
 
 a flash of light erupted from both wands for a moment scabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly ron yelled the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then 
 
 it was like watching a film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on his back was standing up 
 
 he was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again 
 
 well hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no see 
 
 ssiriusrremus even voice was squeaky again his eyes darted toward the door my friendsmy old friends 
 
 wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning took then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casual 
 
 been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed 
 
 remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face you believe him do you he tried to kill me remus 
 
 so heard said lupin more coldly like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if be so 
 
 come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly pointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now going to kill me got to help me remus 
 
 face looked more than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyes 
 
 no going to try and kill you until sorted a few things out said lupin 
 
 sorted things out squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew come after me i knew be back for me been waiting for this for twelve years 
 
 you knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it before 
 
 got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there i suppose taught him a few tricks 
 
 black started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole room 
 
 voldemort teach me tricks he said 
 
 pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him 
 
 what scared to hear your old name said black i blame you peter his lot very happy with you are they 
 
 know what you mean sirius muttered pettigrew his breathing faster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat now 
 
 you been hiding from me for twelve years said black been hiding from old supporters i heard things in azkaban peterthey all think dead or have to answer to heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the them voldemort went to the potters on your informationand voldemort met his downfall there and not all supporters ended up in azkaban did they there are still plenty out here biding their time pretending seen the error of their ways if they ever got wind that you were still alive peter 
 
 knowwhat talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you believe this this madness remus 
 
 i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenly 
 
 innocent but scared squealed pettigrew if supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy sirius black 
 
 face contorted 
 
 how dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself but you peter never understand why i see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends look after you you it used to be usme and remusand james 
 
 pettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breath 
 
 me a spymust be out of your know how you can say such a 
 
 lily and james only made you because i suggested it black hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plana bluffvoldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream use a weak talentless thing like youit must have been the finest moment of your miserable life telling voldemort you could hand him the potters 
 
 pettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words like and lunacy but he help paying more attention to the ashen color of face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door 
 
 professor lupin said hermione timidly can can i say something 
 
 certainly hermione said lupin courteously 
 
 well scabbers i mean this this man been sleeping in dormitory for three years if working for how come he never tried to hurt harry before now 
 
 there said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed hand thank you you see remus i have never hurt a hair of head why should i 
 
 tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you been in hiding for fifteen years they say half dead you about to commit murder right under albus nose for a wreck of a wizard lost all of his power were you want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him you why else did you find a wizard family to take you in keeping an ear out for news you peter just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin him 
 
 pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talk 
 
 er mr black sirius said hermione 
 
 black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her 
 
 if you mind me asking how how did you get out of azkaban if you use dark magic 
 
 thank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactly precisely what i 
 
 but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answer 
 
 i know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that a happy thought so the dementors suck it out of mebut it kept me sane and knowing who i amhelped me keep my powersso when it all becametoo muchi could transform in my cellbecome a dog dementors see you know he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotionsthey could tell that my feelings were less less human less complex when i was a dogbut they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand 
 
 but then i saw peter in that picturei realized he was at hogwarts with harryperfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength again 
 
 pettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotized 
 
 ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of alliesand to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry dare say betrayed lord voldemort be welcomed back with honors 
 
 so you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still alive 
 
 harry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs wealsey the guards say been talking in his sleep always the same words at hogwarts 
 
 it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors destroy itit a happy feelingit was an obsessionbut it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confusedi was thin very thinthin enough to slip through the barsi swam as a dog back to the mainland i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of course you fly as well as your father did harry 
 
 he looked at harry who did not look away 
 
 believe me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed them 
 
 and at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he nodded 
 
 no 
 
 pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though praying 
 
 sirius peteryour friendyou 
 
 black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled 
 
 enough filth on my robes without you touching them said black 
 
 remus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you believe this sirius have told you changed the plan 
 
 not if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume why you tell me sirius he said casually over head 
 
 forgive me remus said black 
 
 not at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spy 
 
 of course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him together 
 
 yes i think so said lupin grimly 
 
 you gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ron 
 
 i been a good frienda good pet you let them kill me ron will on my side you 
 
 but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion 
 
 i let you sleep in my bed he said 
 
 kind boykind master pettigrew crawled toward ron you let them do iti was your rati was a good pet 
 
 if you made a better rat than a human not much to boast about peter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of reach pettigrew turned on his knees staggered forward and seized the hem of robes 
 
 sweet girlclever girlyou you let themhelp me 
 
 hermione pulled her robes out of clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrified 
 
 pettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably and turned his head slowly toward harry 
 
 harryharryyou look just like your fatherjust like him 
 
 how dare you speak to harry roared black how dare you face him how dare you talk about james in front of him 
 
 harry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretched harry james have wanted me killedjames would have understood harryhe would have shown me mercy 
 
 both black and lupin strode forward seized shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terror staring up at them 
 
 you sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking too do you deny it 
 
 pettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversized balding baby cowering on the floor 
 
 sirius sirius what could i have done the dark lordyou have no ideahe has weapons you imagine i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to forced me 
 
 lie bellowed black been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spy 
 
 he he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew was there to be gained by refusing him 
 
 what was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed said black with a terrible fury in his face only innocent lives peter 
 
 you understand whined pettigrew he would have killed me sirius 
 
 then you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for you 
 
 black and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raised 
 
 you should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort kill you we would peter 
 
 hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall 
 
 no harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front pettigrew facing the wands you kill him he said breathlessly you 
 
 black and lupin both looked staggered 
 
 harry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too without turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family 
 
 i know harry panted take him up to the castle hand him over to the dementorshe can go to azkabanbut kill him 
 
 harry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around knees you thank you more than i deserve thank you 
 
 get off me harry spat throwing hands off him in disgust not doing this for you doing it because i reckon my dad wanted them to become killers just for you 
 
 no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wands 
 
 the only person who has the right to decide harry said black but think think what he did 
 
 he can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that place he does 
 
 pettigrew was still wheezing behind him 
 
 very well said lupin stand aside harry 
 
 harry hesitated 
 
 going to tie him up said lupin all i swear 
 
 harry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gagged 
 
 but if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harry 
 
 harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see him 
 
 right said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing 
 
 he hurried over to ron bent down tapped leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and wince 
 
 better he said thanks 
 
 what about professor snape said hermione in a small voice looking down at prone figure 
 
 nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little overenthusiastic still out cold er perhaps it will be best if we revive him until safety back in the castle we can take him like this 
 
 he muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing position head still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a few inches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket 
 
 and two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sure 
 
 do it said lupin 
 
 and me said ron savagely limping forward 
 
 black conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to right right arm to left face was set he seemed to have taken true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the hungarian horntailcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the prospect of talking with sirius was all that sustained harry over the next fortnight the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in the first task was drawing steadily nearer he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster barring his path he had never suffered nerves like these they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match not even his last one against slytherin which had decided who would win the quidditch cup harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to and would finish with the first task 
 
 admittedly he see how sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment harry wrote back to sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time sirius had suggested and he and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question if the worst came to the worst they were going to drop a bag of dungbombs but they hoped they have to resort to that filch would skin them alive 
 
 in the meantime life became even worse for harry within the confines of the castle for rita skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard tournament and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of harry much of the front page had been given over to a picture of harry the article continuing on pages two six and seven had been all about harry the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions misspelled had been squashed into the last line of the article and cedric been mentioned at all 
 
 the article had appeared ten days ago and harry still got a sick burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it rita skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he remember ever saying in his life let alone in that broom cupboard 
 
 
 
 i suppose i get my strength from my parents i know be very proud of me if they could see me sometimes at night i still cry about them not ashamed to admit know nothing will hurt me during the tournament because watching over me 
 but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his into long sickly sentences she had interviewed other people about him too 
 
 harry has at last found love at hogwarts his close friend colin creevey says that harry is rarely seen out of the company of one hermione granger a stunningly pretty girl who like harry is one of the top students in the school 
 from the moment the article had appeared harry had had to endure people slytherins mainly quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments 
 
 want a hanky potter in case you start crying in transfiguration 
 
 since when have you been one of the top students in the school potter or is this a school you and longbottom have set up together 
 
 hey harry 
 
 yeah right harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor having had just about enough just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum and just off to do a bit more 
 
 no it was just you dropped your quill 
 
 it was cho harry felt the color rising in his face 
 
 oh right sorry he muttered taking the quill back 
 
 ergood luck on tuesday she said i really hope you do well 
 
 which left harry feeling extremely stupid 
 
 hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too but she yet started yelling at innocent bystanders in fact harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation 
 
 stunningly pretty her pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come with hermione after article had appeared what was she judging against a chipmunk 
 
 ignore it hermione said in a dignified voice holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering slytherin girls as though she hear them just ignore it harry 
 
 but harry ignore it ron spoken to him at all since he had told him about detentions harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats brains in dungeon but that had been the day article had appeared which seemed to have confirmed belief that harry was really enjoying all the attention 
 
 hermione was furious with the pair of them she went from one to the other trying to force them to talk to each other but harry was adamant he would talk to ron again only if ron admitted that harry put his name in the goblet of fire and apologized for calling him a liar 
 
 i start this harry said stubbornly his problem 
 
 you miss him hermione said impatiently and i know he misses you 
 
 miss him said harry i miss him 
 
 but this was a downright lie harry liked hermione very much but she just the same as ron there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend harry still mastered summoning charms he seemed to have developed something of a block about them and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes 
 
 viktor krum was in the library an awful lot too and harry wondered what he was up to was he studying or was he looking for things to help him through the first task hermione often complained about krum being there not that he ever bothered them but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves and hermione found the noise distracting 
 
 not even she muttered angrily glaring at sharp profile they only like him because famous they look twice at him if he do that thing 
 
 wronski feint said harry through gritted teeth quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct it caused him another pang to imagine expression if he could have heard hermione talking about 
 
 
 
 it is a strange thing but when you are dreading something and would give anything to slow down time it has a disobliging habit of speeding up the days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went as everpresent as the snide comments about the daily prophet article 
 
 on the saturday before the first task all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade hermione told harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit and harry need much persuasion 
 
 what about ron though he said you want to go with him 
 
 went slightly pink i thought we might meet up with him in the three broomsticks 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 oh harry this is so stupid 
 
 come but not meeting ron and wearing my invisibility cloak 
 
 oh all right then hermione snapped but i hate talking to you in that cloak i never know if looking at you or not 
 
 so harry put on his invisibility cloak in the dormitory went back downstairs and together he and hermione set off for hogsmeade 
 
 harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village most of them sporting support cedric diggory badges but no horrible remarks came his way for a change and nobody was quoting that stupid article 
 
 people keep looking at me now said hermione grumpily as they came out of honeydukes sweetshop later eating large chocolates they think talking to myself 
 
 move your lips so much then 
 
 come on please just take off your cloak for a bit no going to bother you here 
 
 oh yeah said harry look behind you 
 
 rita skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the three broomsticks pub talking in low voices they passed right by hermione without hooking at her harry backed into the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him with her handbag when they were gone harry said staying in the village i bet coming to watch the first task 
 
 as he said it his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic he mention this he and hermione discussed what was coming in the first task much he had the feeling she want to think about it 
 
 gone said hermione looking right through harry toward the end of the street why we go and have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks a bit cold it you have to talk to ron she added irritably correctly interpreting his silence 
 
 the three broomsticks was packed mainly with hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon but also with a variety of magical people harry rarely saw anywhere else harry supposed that as hogsmeade was the only village in britain it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves 
 
 it was very hard to move through crowds in the invisibility cloak in case you accidentally trod on someone which tended to lead to awkward questions harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while hermione went to buy drinks on his way through the pub harry spotted ron who was sitting with fred george and lee jordan resisting the urge to give ron a good hard poke in the back of the head he finally reached the table and sat down at it 
 
 hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak 
 
 i look like such an idiot sitting here on my own she muttered lucky i brought something to do 
 
 and she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of members harry saw his and names at the top of the very short list it seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together and hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer 
 
 you know maybe i should try and get some of the villagers involved in hermione said thoughtfully looking around the pub 
 
 yeah right said harry he took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak hermione when are you going to give up on this spew stuff 
 
 when have decent wages and working conditions she hissed back you know starting to think time for more direct action i wonder how you get into the school kitchens 
 
 no idea ask fred and george said harry 
 
 hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence while harry drank his butterbeer watching the people in the pub all of them looked cheerful and relaxed ernie macmillan and hannah abbot were swapping chocolate frog cards at a nearby table both of them sporting support cedric diggory badges on their cloaks right over by the door he saw cho and a large group of her ravenclaw friends she wearing a cedric badge cheered up harry very slightly 
 
 what he have given to be one of these people sitting around laughing and talking with nothing to worry about but homework he imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name come out of the goblet of fire he be wearing the invisibility cloak for one thing ron would be sitting with him the three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on tuesday have been really hooking forward to it watching them do whatever it wascheering on cedric with everyone else safe in a seat at the back of the stands 
 
 he wondered how the other champions were feeling every time he had seen cedric lately he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited harry glimpsed fleur delacour from time to time in the corridors she looked exactly as she always did haughty and unruffled and krum just sat in the library poring over books 
 
 harry thought of sirius and the tight tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly he would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire assuming nothing went wrong as everything else had done lately 
 
 look hagrid said hermione 
 
 the back of enormous shaggy head he had mercifully abandoned his bunches emerged over the crowd harry wondered why he spotted him at once as hagrid was so large but standing up carefully he saw that hagrid had been leaning low talking to professor moody hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him but moody was drinking from his hip flask madam rosmerta the pretty landlady seem to think much of this she was looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables around them perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead but harry knew better moody had told them all during their last defense against the dark arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an unattended cup 
 
 as harry watched he saw hagrid and moody get up to leave he waved then remembered that hagrid see him moody however paused his magical eye on the corner where harry was standing he tapped hagrid in the small of the back being unable to reach his shoulder muttered something to him and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward harry and table 
 
 all right hermione said hagrid loudly 
 
 hello said hermione smiling back 
 
 moody limped around the table and bent down harry thought he was reading the notebook until he muttered nice cloak potter 
 
 harry stared at him in amazement the large chunk missing from nose was particularly obvious at a few inches distance moody grinned 
 
 can your eye i mean can you 
 
 yeah it can see through invisibility cloaks moody said quietly and come in useful at times i can tell you 
 
 hagrid was beaming down at harry too harry knew hagrid see him but moody had obviously told hagrid he was there hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the notebook as well and said in a whisper so low that only harry could hear it harry meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin wear that cloak 
 
 straightening up hagrid said loudly nice ter see yeh hermione winked and departed moody followed him 
 
 why does hagrid want me to meet him at midnight harry said very surprised 
 
 does he said hermione looking startled i wonder what up to i know whether you should go harry she looked nervously around and hissed it might make you late for sirius 
 
 it was true that going down to at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with sirius very fine indeed hermione suggested sending hedwig down to to tell him he go always assuming she would consent to take the note of course harry however thought it better just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him for he was very curious to know what this might be hagrid had never asked harry to visit him so late at night 
 
 at half past eleven that evening harry who had pretended to go up to bed early pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room quite a few people were still in there the creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of support cedric diggory badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say support harry potter instead so far however all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on potter stinks harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so keeping an eye on his watch then hermione opened the fat lady for him from outside as they had planned he slipped past her with a whispered thanks and set off through the castle 
 
 the grounds were very dark harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in cabin the inside of the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also lit up harry could hear madame maxime talking inside it as he knocked on front door 
 
 you there harry hagrid whispered opening the door and looking around 
 
 yeah said harry slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head up 
 
 got summat ter show yeh said hagrid 
 
 there was an air of enormous excitement about hagrid he was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole it looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair harry could see the broken teeth tangled in it 
 
 you showing me harry said warily wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs or hagrid had managed to buy another giant dog off a stranger in a pub 
 
 come with me keep quiet an keep yerself covered with that cloak said hagrid we won take fang he won like it 
 
 listen hagrid i stay got to be back up at the castle by one 
 
 but hagrid listening he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night harry hurried to follow and found to his great surprise that hagrid was leading him to the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 hagrid what 
 
 shhh said hagrid and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands 
 
 madame maxime opened it she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders she smiled when she saw hagrid 
 
 ah agridit is time 
 
 said hagrid beaming at her and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps 
 
 madame maxime closed the door behind her hagrid offered her his arm and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing madame giant winged horses with harry totally bewildered running to keep up with them had hagrid wanted to show him madame maxime he could see her any old time he wantedshe exactly hard to miss 
 
 but it seemed that madame maxime was in for the same treat as harry because after a while she said playfully wair is it you are taking me agrid 
 
 enjoy this said hagrid gruffly worth seein trust me don go tellin anyone i showed yeh right not ter know 
 
 of course not said madame maxime fluttering her long black eyelashes 
 
 and still they walked harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake checking his watch every now and then hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand which might make him miss sirius if they get there soon he was going to turn around go straight back to the castle and leave hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with madame maxime 
 
 but then when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight harry heard something men were shouting up aheadthen came a deafening earsplitting roar 
 
 hagrid led madame maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt harry hurried up alongside them for a split second he thought he was seeing bonfires and men darting around them and then his mouth fell open 
 
 dragons 
 
 four fully grown enormous dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood roaring and snorting torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open fanged mouths fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks there was a one with long pointed horns snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground a green one which was writhing and stamping with all its might a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face which was shooting fire clouds into the air and a gigantic black one more than the others which was nearest to them 
 
 at least thirty wizards seven or eight to each dragon were attempting to control them pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs mesmerized harry looked up high above him and saw the eyes of the black dragon with vertical pupils like a bulging with either fear or rage he tell was making a horrible noise a yowling screeching scream 
 
 keep back there hagrid yelled a wizard near the fence straining on the chain he was holding they can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet you know seen this horntail do forty 
 
 it beautiful said hagrid softly 
 
 no good yelled another wizard stunning spells on the count of three 
 
 harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand 
 
 stupefy they shouted in unison and the stunning spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets bursting in showers of stars on the dragons scaly hides 
 
 harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame though still smoking then very slowly it fell several tons of sinewy dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake 
 
 the dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges each of which was the size of a small hill they hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs which they forced deep into the ground with their wands 
 
 wan a closer look hagrid asked madame maxime excitedly the pair of them moved right up to the fence and harry followed the wizard who had warned hagrid not to come any closer turned and harry realized who it was charlie weasley 
 
 all right hagrid he panted coming over to talk they should be okay now we put them out with a sleeping draft on the way here thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet but like you saw they happy not happy at all 
 
 what breeds you got here charlie said hagrid gazing at the closest dragon the black one with something chose to reverence its eyes were still just open harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid 
 
 this is a hungarian horntail said charlie a common welsh green over there the smaller one a swedish that and a chinese fireball the red 
 
 charlie looked around madame maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure gazing at the stunned dragons 
 
 i know you were bringing her hagrid charlie said frowning the champions supposed to know coming bound to tell her student she 
 
 jus thought like ter see em shrugged hagrid still gazing enraptured at the dragons 
 
 really romantic date hagrid said charlie shaking his head 
 
 four said hagrid so one fer each o the champions is it they gotta do fight em 
 
 just get past them i think said charlie be on hand if it gets nasty extinguishing spells at the ready they wanted nesting mothers i know whybut i tell you this i envy the one who gets the horntail vicious thing its back as dangerous as its front look 
 
 charlie pointed toward the tail and harry saw long spikes protruding along it every few inches 
 
 five of fellow keepers staggered up to the horntail at that moment carrying a clutch of huge eggs between them in a blanket they placed them carefully at the side hagrid let out a moan of longing 
 
 got them counted hagrid said charlie sternly then he said harry 
 
 fine said hagrid he was still gazing at the eggs 
 
 just hope still fine after faced this lot said charlie grimly looking out over the dragons enclosure i dare tell mum what got to do for the first task already having kittens about him charlie imitated his anxious voice how could they let him enter that tournament much too young i thought they were all safe i thought there was going to be an age limit she was in floods after that daily prophet article about him he still cries about his parents oh bless him i never knew 
 
 harry had had enough trusting to the fact that hagrid miss him with the attractions of four dragons and madame maxime to occupy him he turned silently and began to walk away back to the castle 
 
 he know whether he was glad seen what was coming or not perhaps this way was better the first shock was over now maybe if seen the dragons for the first time on tuesday he would have passed out cold in front of the whole schoolbut maybe he would was going to be armed with his wand which just now felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood against a scaly dragon and he had to get past it with everyone watching how 
 
 harry sped up skirting the edge of the forest he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to sirius and he remember ever wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now when without warning he ran into something very solid 
 
 harry fell backward his glasses askew clutching the cloak around him a voice nearby said ouch there 
 
 harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit he recognized the goateeit was karkaroff 
 
 there said karkaroff again very suspiciously looking around in the darkness harry remained still and silent after a minute or so karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal he was looking around at waist height as though expecting to see a dog then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were 
 
 very slowly and very carefully harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise hurrying through the darkness back toward hogwarts 
 
 he had no doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up to he had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be he might even have spotted hagrid and madame maxime heading off around the forest together they were hardly difficult to spot at a distanceand now all karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices and he like madame maxime would know what was in store for the champions 
 
 by the looks of it the only champion who would be facing the unknown on tuesday was cedric 
 
 harry reached the castle slipped in through the front doors and began to climb the marble stairs he was very out of breath but he dare slow had less than five minutes to get up to the fire 
 
 balderdash he gasped at the fat lady who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole 
 
 if you say so she muttered sleepily without opening her eyes and the picture swung forward to admit him harry climbed inside the common room was deserted and judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal hermione had not needed to set off any dungbombs to ensure that he and sirius got privacy 
 
 harry pulled off the invisibility cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire the room was in semidarkness the flames were the only source of light nearby on a table the support cedric diggory badges the creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight they now read potter really stinks harry looked back into the flames and jumped 
 
 head was sitting in the fire if harry seen mr diggory do exactly this back in the weasleys kitchen it would have scared him out of his wits instead his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days he scrambled out of his chair crouched down by the hearth and said sirius you doing 
 
 sirius looked different from memory of him when they had said face had been gaunt and sunken surrounded by a quantity of long black matted hair but the hair was short and clean now face was fuller and he looked younger much more like the only photograph harry had of him which had been taken at the potters wedding 
 
 never mind me how are you said sirius seriously 
 
 for a second harry tried to say fine but he do it before he could stop himself he was talking more than talked in days about how no one believed he entered the tournament of his own free will how rita skeeter had lied about him in the daily prophet how he walk down a corridor without being sneered at and about ron ron not believing him jealousy 
 
 and now just shown me coming in the first task and dragons sirius and a goner he finished desperately 
 
 sirius looked at him eyes full of concern eyes that had not yet lost the look that azkaban had given them that deadened haunted look he had let harry talk himself into silence without interruption but now he said dragons we can deal with harry but get to that in a minute i got long broken into a wizarding house to use the fire but they could be back at any time there are things i need to warn you about 
 
 what said harry feeling his spirits slip a further few there could be nothing worse than dragons coming 
 
 karkaroff said sirius harry he was a death eater you know what death eaters are you 
 
 yes he what 
 
 he was caught he was in azkaban with me but he got released bet everything why dumbledore wanted an auror at hogwarts this year to keep an eye on him moody caught karkaroff put him into azkaban in the first place 
 
 karkaroff got released harry said slowly his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information why did they release him 
 
 he did a deal with the ministry of magic said sirius bitterly he said seen the error of his ways and then he named nameshe put a load of other people into azkaban in his not very popular in there i can tell you and since he got out from what i can tell been teaching the dark arts to every student who passes through that school of his so watch out for the durmstrang champion as well 
 
 okay said harry slowly butare you saying karkaroff put my name in the goblet because if he did a really good actor he seemed furious about it he wanted to stop me from competing 
 
 we know a good actor said sirius because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free he now been keeping an eye on the daily prophet harry 
 
 you and the rest of the world said harry bitterly 
 
 and reading between the lines of that skeeter article last month moody was attacked the night before he started at hogwarts yes i know she says it was another false alarm sirius said hastily seeing harry about to speak but i think so somehow i think someone tried to stop him from getting to hogwarts i think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around and no going to look into it too closely heard intruders a bit too often but that mean he still spot the real thing moody was the best auror the ministry ever had 
 
 sowhat are you saying said harry slowly trying to kill me but why 
 
 sirius hesitated 
 
 been nearing some very strange things he said slowly the death eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately they showed themselves at the quidditch world cup they someone set off the dark markand then did you hear about that ministry of magic witch gone missing 
 
 bertha jorkins said harry 
 
 exactlyshe disappeared in albania and definitely where voldemort was rumored to be lastand she would have known the triwizard tournament was coming up she 
 
 yeah not very likely have walked straight into voldemort is it said harry 
 
 listen i knew bertha jorkins said sirius grimly she was at hogwarts when i was a few years above your dad and me and she was an idiot very nosy but no brains none at all not a good combination harry say be very easy to lure into a trap 
 
 soso voldemort could have found out about the tournament said harry is that what you mean you think karkaroff might be here on his orders 
 
 i know said sirius slowly i just knowkarkaroff strike me as the type go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort was powerful enough to protect him but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason and i help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident 
 
 looks hike a really good plan from where standing said harry grinning bleaky just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff 
 
 right these dragons said sirius speaking very quickly now a way harry be tempted to try a stunning spell dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single stunner you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon 
 
 yeah i know i just saw said harry 
 
 but you can do it alone said sirius there is away and a simple all you need just 
 
 but harry held up a hand to silence him his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him 
 
 go he hissed at sirius go someone coming 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet hiding the fire if someone saw face within the walls of hogwarts they would raise an almighty uproar the ministry would get dragged in he harry would be questioned about whereabouts 
 
 harry heard a tiny pop in the fire behind him and knew sirius had gone he watched the bottom of the spiral staircase who had decided to go for a stroll at one in the morning and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon 
 
 it was ron dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas ron stopped dead facing harry across the room and looked around 
 
 who were you talking to he said 
 
 that got to do with you harry snarled what are you doing down here at this time of night 
 
 i just wondered where you ron broke off shrugging nothing going back to bed 
 
 just thought come nosing around did you harry shouted he knew that ron had no idea what walked in on knew he done it on purpose but he care at this moment he hated everything about ron right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers 
 
 sorry about that said ron his face reddening with anger realized you want to be disturbed let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace 
 
 harry seized one of the potter really stinks badges off the table and chucked it as hard as he could across the room it hit ron on the forehead and bounced off 
 
 there you go harry said something for you to wear on tuesday you might even have a scar now if what you want it 
 
 he strode across the room toward the stairs he half expected ron to stop him he would even have liked ron to throw a punch at him but ron just stood there in his pajamas and harry having stormed upstairs lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and hear him come up to bed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the lion and the serpentcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks a glowing secret that supported him through classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes he and the da were resisting her under her very nose doing the very thing she and the ministry most feared and whenever he was supposed to be reading wilbert book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings remembering how neville had successfully disarmed hermione how colin creevey had mastered the impediment jinx after three meetings hard effort how parvati patil had produced such a good reductor curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the sneakoscopes to dust 
 
 he was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the da meetings as they had to accommodate three separate quidditch practices which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions but harry was not sorry about this he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable if anyone was watching them it would be hard to make out a pattern 
 
 hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice because it would look suspicious if people from different houses were seen crossing the great hall to talk to each other too often she gave each of the members of the da a fake galleon ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold 
 
 you see the numerals around the edge of the coins hermione said holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting the coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches on real galleons just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin on these fake coins though the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting the coins will grow hot when the date changes so if carrying them in a pocket be able to feel them we take one each and when harry sets the date of the next meeting change the numbers on his coin and because put a protean charm on them all change to mimic his 
 
 a blank silence greeted words she looked around at all the faces upturned to her rather disconcerted 
 
 welli thought it was a good idea she said uncertainly i mean even if umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets nothing fishy about carrying a galleon is there but well if you want to use them 
 
 you can do a protean charm said terry boot 
 
 yes said hermione 
 
 but newt standard that is he said weakly 
 
 oh said hermione trying to look modest oh well yes i suppose it is 
 
 how come not in ravenclaw he demanded staring at hermione with something close to wonder with brains like yours 
 
 well the sorting hat did seriously consider putting me in ravenclaw during my sorting said hermione brightly but it decided on gryffindor in the end so does that mean using the galleons 
 
 there was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forwards to collect one from the basket harry looked sideways at hermione 
 
 you know what these remind me of 
 
 no that 
 
 the death eaters scars voldemort touches one of them and all their scars burn and they know got to join him 
 
 well yes said hermione quietly that is where i got the idea but notice i decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members skin 
 
 yeah i prefer your way said harry grinning as he slipped his galleon into his pocket i suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them 
 
 fat chance said ron who was examining his own fake galleon with a slightly mournful air i got any real galleons to confuse it with 
 
 as the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin drew nearer their da meetings were put on hold because angelina insisted on almost daily practices the fact that the quidditch cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome for they of course would be playing both teams over the coming year and the heads of house of the competing teams though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship were determined to see their own side victorious harry realised how much professor mcgonagall cared about beating slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match 
 
 i think got enough to be getting on with at the moment she said loftily nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at harry and ron and said grimly become accustomed to seeing the quidditch cup in my study boys and i really want to have to hand it over to professor snape so use the extra time to practise you 
 
 snape was no less obviously partisan he had booked the quidditch pitch for slytherin practice so often that the gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play he was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of slytherin attempts to hex gryffindor players in the corridors when alicia spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth snape insisted that she must have attempted a charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen who insisted they had seen the slytherin keeper miles bletchley hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library 
 
 harry felt optimistic about gryffindors chances they had after all never lost to team admittedly ron was still not performing to standard but he was working extremely hard to improve his greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after made a blunder if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more on the other hand harry had seen ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form during one memorable practice he had hung from his broom and kicked the quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by barry ryan the irish international keeper against top chaser ladislaw zamojski even fred had said that ron might yet make him and george proud and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years 
 
 the only thing really worrying harry was how much ron was allowing the tactics of the slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch harry of course had endured their snide comments for over four years so whispers of hey potty i heard sworn to knock you off your broom on saturday far from chilling his blood made him laugh so pathetic be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me he retorted which made ron and hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off pansy face 
 
 but ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults jeers and intimidation when slytherins some of them and considerably larger than he was muttered as they passed in the corridors got your bed booked in the hospital wing weasley he laugh but turned a delicate shade of green when draco malfoy imitated ron dropping the quaffle which he did whenever they came within sight of each other ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too 
 
 october extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and november arrived cold as frozen iron with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces the skies and the ceiling of the great hall turned a pale pearly grey the mountains around hogwarts were snowcapped and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many students wore their thick protective dragonskin gloves in the corridors between lessons 
 
 the morning of the match dawned bright and cold when harry awoke he looked round at bed and saw him sitting bolt upright his arms around his knees staring fixedly into space 
 
 you all right said harry 
 
 ron nodded but did not speak harry was reminded forcibly of the time ron had accidentally put a charm on himself he looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth 
 
 you just need some breakfast harry said bracingly 
 
 the great hall was filling up fast when they arrived the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual as they passed the slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise harry looked round and saw that in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown for some reason many of them waved at ron laughing uproariously harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by but he was too concerned to get ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them 
 
 they received a rousing welcome at the gryffindor table where everyone was wearing red and gold but far from raising spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale he collapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal 
 
 i been mental to do this he said in a croaky whisper mental 
 
 be thick said harry firmly passing him a choice of cereals going to be fine normal to be nervous 
 
 rubbish croaked ron lousy i play to save my life what was i thinking 
 
 get a grip said harry sternly look at that save you made with your foot the other day even fred and george said it was brilliant 
 
 ron turned a tortured face to harry 
 
 that was an accident he whispered miserably i mean to do iti slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and when i was trying to get back on i kicked the quaffle by accident 
 
 well said harry recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise a few more accidents like that and the in the bag it 
 
 hermione and ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves gloves and rosettes 
 
 you feeling ginny asked ron who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them 
 
 just nervous said harry 
 
 well a good sign i never feel you perform as well in exams if not a bit nervous said hermione heartily 
 
 hello said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them harry looked up luna lovegood had drifted over from the ravenclaw table many people were staring at her and a few were openly laughing and pointing she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a head which was perched precariously on her head 
 
 supporting gryffindor said luna pointing unnecessarily at her hat look what it does 
 
 she reached up and tapped the hat with her wand it opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump 
 
 good it said luna happily i wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent slytherin you know but there time anyway good luck ronald 
 
 she drifted away they had not quite recovered from the shock of hat before angelina came hurrying towards them accompanied by katie and alicia whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by madam pomfrey 
 
 when ready she said going to go straight down to the pitch check out conditions and change 
 
 be there in a bit harry assured her just got to have some breakfast 
 
 it became clear after ten minutes however that ron was not capable of eating anything more and harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms as they rose from the table hermione got up too and taking arm she drew him to one side 
 
 let ron see on those slytherins badges she whispered urgently 
 
 harry looked questioningly at her but she shook her head warningly ron had just ambled over to them looking lost and desperate 
 
 good luck ron said hermione standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek and you harry 
 
 ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the great hall he touched the spot on his face where hermione had kissed him looking puzzled as though he was not quite sure what had just happened he seemed too distracted to notice much around him but harry cast a curious glance at the badges as they passed the slytherin table and this time he made out the words etched on to them 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 with an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good he hurried ron across the entrance hall clown the stone steps and out into the icy air 
 
 the frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the stadium there was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes harry pointed out these encouraging factors to ron as they walked but he was not sure that ron was listening 
 
 angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered harry and ron pulled on their robes ron attempted to do his up for several minutes before alicia took pity on him and went to help then sat down to listen to the talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch 
 
 ok only just found out the final for slytherin said angelina consulting a piece of parchment last beaters derrick and bole have left but it looks as though replaced them with the usual gorillas rather than anyone who can fly particularly well two blokes called crabbe and goyle i know much about them 
 
 we do said harry and ron together 
 
 well they look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other said angelina pocketing her parchment but then i was always surprised derrick and bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without signposts 
 
 crabbe and goyle are in the same mould harry assured her 
 
 they could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators stands some people were singing though harry could not make out the words he was starting to feel nervous but he knew his butterflies were as nothing compared to who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again his jaw set and his complexion pale grey 
 
 time said angelina in a hushed voice looking at her watch everyone good luck 
 
 the team rose shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight a roar of sound greeted them in which harry could still hear singing though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles 
 
 the slytherin team was standing waiting for them they too were wearing those silver badges the new captain montague was built along the same lines as dudley dursley with massive forearms like hairy hams behind him lurked crabbe and goyle almost as large blinking stupidly in the sunlight swinging their new beaters bats malfoy stood to one side the sunlight gleaming on his head he caught eye and smirked tapping the badge on his chest 
 
 captains shake hands ordered the referee madam hooch as angelina and montague reached each other harry could tell that montague was trying to crush fingers though she did not wince mount your brooms 
 
 madam hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew 
 
 the balls were released and the fourteen players shot upwards out of the corner of his eye harry saw ron streak off towards the goalhoops harry zoomed higher dodging a bludger and set off on a wide lap of the pitch gazing around for a glint of gold on the other side of the stadium draco malfoy was doing exactly the same 
 
 and johnson johnson with the quaffle what a player that girl is been saying it for years but she still go out with me 
 
 jordan yelled professor mcgonagall 
 
 just a fun fact professor adds a bit of interestand ducked warrington passed montague hit from behind by a bludger from crabbe montague catches the quaffle montague heading back up the pitch andnice bludger there from george weasley a bludger to the head for montague he drops the quaffle caught by katie bell katie bell of gryffindor to alicia spinnet and away 
 
 lee commentary rang through the stadium and harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd all yelling and booing and singing 
 
 dodges warrington avoids a bludgerclose call aliciaand the crowd are loving this just listen to them that singing 
 
 and as lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the slytherin section of the stands 
 
 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 why slytherins all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 a nd alicia passes back to angelina lee shouted and as harry swerved his insides boiling at what he had just heard he knew lee was trying to drown out the words of the song come on now angelinalooks like got just the keeper to shootssheaaaah 
 
 bletchley the slytherin keeper had saved the goal he threw the quaffle to warrington who sped off with it in between alicia and katie the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer ron 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 harry could not help himself abandoning his search for the snitch he wheeled around to watch ron a lone figure at the far end of the pitch hovering before the three goalhoops while the massive warrington pelted towards him 
 
 and warrington with the quaffle warrington heading for goal out of bludger range with just the keeper ahead 
 
 a great swell of song rose from the slytherin stands below 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 
 
 so the first test for new gryffindor keeper weasley brother of beaters fred and george and a promising new talent on the teamcome on ron 
 
 but the scream of delight came from the slytherins end ron had dived wildly his arms wide and the quaffle had soared between them straight through central hoop 
 
 slytherin score came voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below so to slytherinbad luck ron 
 
 the slytherins sang even louder 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 and gryffindor back in possession and katie bell tanking up the pitch cried lee valiantly though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 harry what are you doing screamed angelina soaring past him to keep up with katie get going 
 
 harry realised he had been stationary in midair for over a minute watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the snitch horrified he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again staring around trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 there was no sign of the snitch anywhere he looked malfoy was still circling the stadium just as he was they passed one another midway around the pitch going in opposite directions and harry heard malfoy singing loudly 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 
 
 and warrington again bellowed lee who passes to pucey off past spinnet come on now angelina you can take him turns out you nice bludger from fred weasley i mean george weasley oh who cares one of them anyway and warrington drops the quaffle and katie bellerdrops it tooso montague with the quaffle slytherin captain montague takes the quaffle and off up the pitch come on now gryffindor block him 
 
 harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the slytherin goalhoops willing himself not to look at what was going on at end as he sped past the slytherin keeper he heard bletchley singing along with the crowd below 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 and dodged alicia again and heading straight for goal stop it ron 
 
 harry did not have to look to see what had happened there was a terrible groan from the gryffindor end coupled with fresh screams and applause from the slytherins looking down harry saw the pansy parkinson right at the front of the stands her back to the pitch as she conducted the slytherin supporters who were roaring 
 
 why slytherins all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 but was nothing there was still time for gryffindor to catch up or catch the snitch a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual harry assured himself bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be watchstrap 
 
 but ron let in two more goals there was an edge of panic in desire to find the snitch now if he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly 
 
 and katie bell of gryffindor dodges pucey ducks montague nice swerve katie and she throws to johnson angelina johnson takes the quaffle past warrington heading for goal come on now angelinagryffindor score to slytherin and pucey has the quaffle 
 
 harry could hear ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the gryffindor cheers and felt heartened only thirty points in it that was nothing they could pull back easily harry ducked a bludger that crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the snitch keeping one eye on malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it but malfoy like him was continuing to soar around the stadium searching fruitlessly 
 
 pucey throws to warrington warrington to montague montague back to puceyjohnson intervenes johnson takes the quaffle johnson to bell this looks goodi mean hit by a bludger from goyle of slytherin and pucey in possession again 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 but harry had seen it at last the tiny fluttering golden snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the slytherin end of the pitch 
 
 he dived 
 
 in a matter of seconds malfoy was streaking out of the sky on left a green and silver blur lying flat on his broom 
 
 the snitch skirted the foot of one of the goalhoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands its change of direction suited malfoy who was nearer harry pulled his firebolt around he and malfoy were now neck and neck 
 
 feet from the ground harry lifted his right hand from his broom stretching towards the snitch to his right arm extended too was reaching groping 
 
 it was over in two breathless desperate windswept fingers closed around the tiny struggling fingernails scrabbled the back of hand hopelesslyharry pulled his broom upwards holding the struggling ball in his hand and the gryffindor spectators screamed their approval 
 
 they were saved it did not matter that ron had let in those goals nobody would remember as long as gryffindor had won 
 
 wham 
 
 a bludger hit harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forwards off his broom luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground having dived so low to catch the snitch but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch he heard madam shrill whistle an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls angry yells and jeering a thud then frantic voice 
 
 are you all right 
 
 course i am said harry grimly taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet madam hooch was zooming towards one of the slytherin players above him though he could not see who it was from this angle 
 
 it was that thug crabbe said angelina angrily he whacked the bludger at you the moment he saw got the snitchbut we won harry we won 
 
 harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around still holding the snitch tightly in his hand draco malfoy had landed close by with fury he was still managing to sneer 
 
 saved neck you he said to harry never seen a worse keeper but then he was born in a bin did you like my lyrics potter 
 
 harry answer he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one yelling and punching the air in triumph all except ron who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone 
 
 we wanted to write another couple of verses malfoy called as katie and alicia hugged harry but we find rhymes for fat and uglywe wanted to sing about his mother see 
 
 talk about sour grapes said angelina casting malfoy a disgusted look 
 
 we fit in useless loser eitherfor his father you know 
 
 fred and george had realised what malfoy was talking about halfway through shaking hand they stiffened looking round at malfoy 
 
 leave it said angelina at once taking fred by the arm leave it fred let him yell just sore he lost the little 
 
 but you like the weasleys you potter said malfoy sneering spend holidays there and everything you see how you stand the stink but i suppose when been dragged up by muggles even the weasleys hovel smells ok 
 
 harry grabbed hold of george meanwhile it was taking the combined efforts of angelina alicia and katie to stop fred leaping on malfoy who was laughing openly harry looked around for madam hooch but she was still berating crabbe for his illegal bludger attack 
 
 or perhaps said malfoy leering as he backed away you can remember what your house stank like potter and pigsty reminds you of it 
 
 harry was not aware of releasing george all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards malfoy he had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching all he wanted to do was cause malfoy as much pain as possible with no time to draw out his wand he merely drew back the fist clutching the snitch and sank it as hard as he could into stomach 
 
 harry harry george no 
 
 he could hear girls voices screaming malfoy yelling george swearing a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him but he did not care not until somebody in the vicinity yelled impedimenta and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of malfoy he could reach 
 
 what do you think doing screamed madam hooch as harry leapt to his feet it seemed to have been her who had hit him with the impediment jinx she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other her broom lay abandoned several feet away malfoy was curled up on the ground whimpering and moaning his nose bloody george was sporting a swollen lip fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three chasers and crabbe was cackling in the background never seen behaviour like itback up to the castle both of you and straight to your head of office go now 
 
 harry and george turned on their heels and marched off the pitch both panting neither saying a word to the other the howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand the knuckles of which he had bruised against jaw looking down he saw the silver wings protruding from between his fingers struggling for release 
 
 they had barely reached the door of professor mcgonagalls office when she came marching along the corridor behind them she was wearing a gryffindor scarf but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode towards them looking livid 
 
 in she said furiously pointing to the door harry and george entered she strode around behind her desk and faced them quivering with rage as she threw the gryffindor scarf aside on to the floor 
 
 well she said i have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition two on one explain yourselves 
 
 malfoy provoked us said harry stiffly 
 
 provoked you shouted professor mcgonagall slamming a fist on to her desk so that her tartan tin slid sideways off it and burst open littering the floor with ginger newts just lost he of course he wanted to provoke you but what on earth he can have said that justified what you two 
 
 he insulted my parents snarled george and mother 
 
 but instead of leaving it to madam hooch to sort out you two decided to give an exhibition of muggle duelling did you bellowed professor mcgonagall have you any idea what 
 
 hem hem 
 
 harry and george both wheeled round dolores umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad and was smiling in the horrible sickly ominous way that harry had come to associate with imminent misery 
 
 may i help professor mcgonagall asked professor umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice 
 
 blood rushed into professor face 
 
 help she repeated in a constricted voice what do you mean help 
 
 professor umbridge moved forwards into the office still smiling her sickly smile 
 
 why i thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority 
 
 harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from professor nostrils 
 
 you thought wrong she said turning her back on umbridge 
 
 now you two had better listen closely i do not care what provocation malfoy offered you i do not care if he insulted every family member you possess your behaviour was disgusting and i am giving each of you a worth of detentions do not look at me like that potter you deserve it and if either of you ever 
 
 hem hem 
 
 professor mcgonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face towards professor umbridge again 
 
 yes 
 
 i think they deserve rather more than detentions said umbridge smiling still more broadly 
 
 professor eyes flew open 
 
 but unfortunately she said with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw it is what i think that counts as they are in my house dolores 
 
 well actually minerva simpered professor umbridge i think find that what i think does count now where is it cornelius just sent it i mean she gave a false little laugh as she rummaged in her handbag the minister just sent it ah yes 
 
 she had pulled out a piece of parchment which she now unfurled clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said 
 
 hem hem educational decree number 
 
 not another one exclaimed professor mcgonagall violently 
 
 well yes said umbridge still smiling as a matter of fact minerva it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment you remember how you overrode me when i was unwilling to allow the gryffindor quidditch team to how you took the case to dumbledore who insisted that the team be allowed to play well now i have that i contacted the minister at once and he quite agreed with me that the high inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges or shethat is to say iwould have less authority than common teachers and you see now you minerva how right i was in attempting to stop the gryffindor team dreadful tempers anyway i was reading out our amendment hem hem the high inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of hogwarts and the power to alter such punishments sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members signed cornelius fudge minister for magic order of merlin first class etc etc 
 
 she rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag still smiling 
 
 so i really think i will have to ban these two from playing quidditch ever again she said looking from harry to george and back again 
 
 harry felt the snitch fluttering madly in his hand 
 
 ban us he said and his voice sounded strangely distant from playing ever again 
 
 yes mr potter i think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick said umbridge her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said you and mr weasley here and i think to be safe this young twin ought to be stopped tooif his teammates had not restrained him i feel sure he would have attacked young mr malfoy as well i will want their broomsticks confiscated of course i shall keep them safely in my office to make sure there is no infringement of my ban but i am not unreasonable professor mcgonagall she continued turning back to professor mcgonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice staring at her the rest of the team can continue playing i saw no signs of violence from any of them well good afternoon to you 
 
 and with a look of the utmost satisfaction umbridge left the room leaving a horrified silence in her wake 
 
 banned said angelina in a hollow voice late that evening in the common room seeker and no beaters what on earth are we going to do 
 
 it did not feel as though they had won the match at all everywhere harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces the team themselves were slumped around the fire all apart from ron who had not been seen since the end of the match 
 
 just so unfair said alicia numbly i mean what about crabbe and that bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown has she banned him 
 
 no said ginny miserably she and hermione were sitting on either side of harry he just got lines i heard montague laughing about it at dinner 
 
 and banning fred when he even do anything said alicia furiously pummelling her knee with her fist 
 
 not my fault i said fred with a very ugly look on his face i pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three been holding me back 
 
 harry stared miserably at the dark window snow was falling the snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room people were watching its progress as though hypnotised and crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair trying to catch it 
 
 going to bed said angelina getting slowly to her feet maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream maybe wake up tomorrow and find we played yet 
 
 she was soon followed by alicia and katie fred and george sloped off to bed some time later glowering at everyone they passed and ginny went not long after that only harry and hermione were left beside the fire 
 
 have you seen ron hermione asked in a low voice 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 i think avoiding us said hermione where do you think he 
 
 but at that precise moment there was a creaking sound behind them as the fat lady swung forwards and ron came clambering through the portrait hole he was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair when he saw harry and hermione he stopped dead in his tracks 
 
 where have you been said hermione anxiously springing up 
 
 walking ron mumbled he was still wearing his quidditch things 
 
 you look frozen said hermione come and sit down 
 
 ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair furthest from not looking at him the stolen snitch zoomed over their heads 
 
 sorry ron mumbled looking at his feet 
 
 what for said harry 
 
 for thinking i can play quidditch said ron going to resign first thing tomorrow 
 
 if you resign said harry testily only be three players left on the team and when ron looked puzzled he said been given a lifetime ban fred and george 
 
 what ron yelped 
 
 hermione told him the full story harry could not bear to tell it again when she had finished ron looked more anguished than ever 
 
 this is all my fault 
 
 you make me punch malfoy said harry angrily 
 
 if i so terrible at quidditch 
 
 got nothing to do with that 
 
 it was that song that wound me up 
 
 it wound anyone up 
 
 hermione got up and walked to the window away from the argument watching the snow swirling down against the pane 
 
 look drop it will you harry burst out bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything 
 
 ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes after a while he said in a dull voice this is the worst ever felt in my life 
 
 join the club said harry bitterly 
 
 well said hermione her voice trembling slightly i can think of one thing that might cheer you both up 
 
 oh yeah said harry sceptically 
 
 yeah said hermione turning away from the window a broad smile spreading across her face back 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen elf tailscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 so all in all not one of better birthdays said fred 
 
 it was evening the hospital wing was quiet the windows curtained the lamps lit was the only occupied bed harry hermione and ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out madam pomfrey had only let them enter at eight fred and george had arrived at ten past 
 
 this how we imagined handing over our present said george grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on bedside cabinet and sitting beside ginny 
 
 yeah when we pictured the scene he was conscious said fred 
 
 there we were in hogsmeade waiting to surprise him said george 
 
 you were in hogsmeade asked ginny looking up 
 
 we were thinking of buying said fred gloomily a hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good do us if you lot allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore but never mind that now 
 
 he drew up a chair beside harry and looked at pale face 
 
 how exactly did it happen harry 
 
 harry retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred times to dumbledore to mcgonagall to madam pomfrey to hermione and to ginny 
 
 and then i got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit slughorn ran for help mcgonagall and madam pomfrey turned up and they brought ron up here they reckon be all right madam pomfrey says have to stay here a week or so keep taking essence of rue 
 
 blimey it was lucky you thought of a bezoar said george in a low voice 
 
 lucky there was one in the room said harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone 
 
 hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff she had been exceptionally quiet all day having hurtled up to harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in harry and obsessive discussion about how ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them and until at last they had been allowed in to see him 
 
 do mum and dad know fred asked ginny 
 
 already seen him they arrived an hour in office now but be back soon 
 
 there was a pause while they all watched ron mumble a little in his sleep 
 
 so the poison was in the drink said fred quietly 
 
 yes said harry at once he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again slughorn poured it out 
 
 would he have been able to slip something into glass without you seeing 
 
 probably said harry but why would slughorn want to poison ron 
 
 no idea said fred frowning you think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake meaning to get you 
 
 why would slughorn want to poison harry asked ginny 
 
 i dunno said fred but there must be loads of people like to poison harry there the chosen one and all that 
 
 so you think a death eater said ginny 
 
 possible said fred darkly 
 
 he could be under the imperius curse said george 
 
 or he could be innocent said ginny the poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for slughorn himself 
 
 want to kill slughorn 
 
 dumbledore reckons voldemort wanted slughorn on his side said harry slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to hogwarts and he thought of the memory dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from slughorn and maybe voldemort wants him out of the way maybe he thinks he could be valuable to dumbledore 
 
 but you said slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to dumbledore for christmas ginny reminded him so the poisoner could just as easily have been after dumbledore 
 
 then the poisoner know slughorn very well said hermione speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold anyone who knew slughorn would have i known there was a good chance keep something that tasty for himself 
 
 croaked ron unexpectedly from between them 
 
 they all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring 
 
 the dormitory doors flew open making them all jump hagrid came striding toward them his hair his bearskin coat flapping behind him a crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy footprints all over the floor 
 
 bin in the forest all day he panted worse i bin readin to himdidn get up ter dinner till jus now an then professor sprout told me abou ron how is he 
 
 not bad said harry they say be okay 
 
 no more than six visitors at a time said madam pomfrey hurrying out of her office 
 
 hagrid makes six george pointed out 
 
 o yes said madam pomfrey who seemed to have been counting hagrid as several people due to his vastness to cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand 
 
 i don believe this said hagrid hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at ron jus don believe it look at him lyin there want ter hurt him eh 
 
 just what we were discussing said harry we know 
 
 someone couldn have a grudge against the gryfinndor quidditch team could they said hagrid anxiously firs katie now ron 
 
 i see anyone trying to bump off a quidditch team said george 
 
 wood done the slytherins if he got away with it said fred fairly 
 
 well i think quidditch but i think a connection between the attacks said hermione quietly 
 
 how work that out asked fred 
 
 well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and although that was pure luck and for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed of course she added broodingly that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim 
 
 before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and mr and mrs weasley hurried up the ward they had done no more than satisfy themselves that ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now mrs weasley seized hold of harry and hugged him very tighty 
 
 told us how you saved him with the bezoar she sobbed oh harry what can we say you saved ginny you saved arthur now saved ron 
 
 be i muttered harry awkwardly 
 
 half our family does seem to owe you their lives now i stop and think about it mr weasley said in a constricted voice well all i can say is that it was a lucky day for the weasleys when ron decided to sit in your compartment on the hogwarts express harry 
 
 harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when madam pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around bed he and hermione rose at once to leave and hagrid decided to go with them leaving ron with his family 
 
 terrible growled hagrid into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase all this new security an kids are still gettin hurt worried sick he don say much but i can tell 
 
 he got any ideas hagrid asked hermione desperately 
 
 i spect got hundreds of ideas brain like his said hagrid but he doesn know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or bin caught wouldn they wha worries me said hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder harry for good measure checked the ceiling for peeves is how long hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein attacked chamber o secrets all over again isn it be panic more parents takin their kids outta school an nex thing yeh know the board o governors 
 
 hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper the board o be talkin about shuttin us up fer good 
 
 surely not said hermione looking worried 
 
 gotta see it from their point o view said hagrid heavily i mean always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter hogwarts hasn it yer expect accidents don yeh with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether but attempted murder s no wonder angry with sn 
 
 hagrid stopped in his tracks a familiar guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard 
 
 what said harry quickly angry with snape 
 
 i never said tha said hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway look at the time gettin on fer midnight i need ter 
 
 hagrid why is dumbledore angry with snape harry asked loudly 
 
 shhhh said hagrid looking both nervous and angry don shout stuff like that harry wan me ter lose me job mind i don suppose care would yeh not now given up care of mag 
 
 try and make me feel guilty it work said harry forcefully snape done 
 
 i dunno harry i heard it at all well i was comin outta the forest the other evenin an i overheard em talking well arguin like ter draw attention to meself so i sorta skulked an tried not ter listen but it was well a heated discussion an it wasn easy ter block it out 
 
 well harry urged him as hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily 
 
 well i jus heard snape sayin dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe hesnapedidn wan ter do it any more 
 
 do what 
 
 i dunno harry it sounded like snape was feelin a bit overworked allanyway dumbledore told him flat out agreed ter do it an that was all there was to it pretty firm with him an then he said summat abou snape makin investigations in his house in slytherin well nothin strange abou that hagrid added hastily as harry and hermione exchanged looks full of meaning all the heads o houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business 
 
 yeah but not having rows with the rest of them is he said harry 
 
 look hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two i know what like abou snape harry an i don want yeh ter go readin more inter this than there is 
 
 look out said hermione tersely 
 
 they turned just in time to see the shadow of argus filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowls aquiver 
 
 oho he wheezed out of bed so late mean detention 
 
 no it won filch said hagrid shortly with me aren they 
 
 and what difference does that make asked filch obnoxiously 
 
 a ruddy teacher aren i yeh sneakin squib said hagrid firing up at once 
 
 there was a nasty hissing noise as filch swelled with fury mrs norris had arrived unseen and was twisting herself sinuously around skinny ankles 
 
 get goin said hagrid out of the corner of his mouth 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he and hermione both hurried off and raised voices echoed behind them as they ran they passed peeves near the turning into gryffindor tower but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling 
 
 when strife and when trouble 
 
 call on peevsie make double 
 
 the fat lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room it did not seem that people knew about ron yet harry was very relieved he had been interrogated enough that day hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls dormitory harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers 
 
 so dumbledore had argued with snape in spite of all he had told harry in spite of his insistence that he trusted snape completely he had lost his temper with him he did not think that snape had tried hard enough to investigate the slytherins or perhaps to investigate a single slytherin malfoy 
 
 was it because dumbledore did not want harry to do anything foolish to take matters into his own hands that he had pretended there was nothing in suspicions that seemed likely it might even be that dumbledore did not want anything to distract harry from their lessons or from procuring that memory from slughorn perhaps dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to 
 
 there you are potter 
 
 harry jumped to his feet in shock his wand at the ready he had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair a closer look showed him that it was cormac mclaggen 
 
 been waiting for you to come back said mclaggen disregarding drawn wand fallen asleep look i saw them taking weasley up to the hospital wing earlier look like be fit for next match 
 
 it took harry a few moments to realize what mclaggen was talking about 
 
 oh right quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair yeah he might not make it 
 
 well then be playing keeper i said mclaggen 
 
 yeah said harry yeah i suppose so 
 
 he could not think of an argument against it after all mclaggen had certainly performed in the trials 
 
 excellent said mclaggen in a satisfied voice so practice 
 
 what oh one tomorrow evening 
 
 good listen potter we should have a talk beforehand got some ideas on strategy you might find useful 
 
 right said harry unenthusiastically well hear them tomorrow then pretty tired now see you 
 
 the news that ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day but it did not cause the sensation that attack had done people seemed to think that it might have been an accident given that he had been in the potions room at the time and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done in fact the gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming quidditch match against hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see zacharias smith who played chaser on the hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against slytherin 
 
 harry however had never been less interested in quidditch he was rapidly becoming obsessed with draco malfoy still checking the map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary and still there were those inexplicable times when malfoy simply vanished from the map 
 
 but harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem what with quidditch practice homework and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by cormac mclaggen and lavender brown 
 
 he could not decide which of them was more annoying mclaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent keeper for the team than ron and that now that harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide harry with detailed training schemes so that more than once harry was forced to remind him who was captain 
 
 meanwhile lavender kept sidling up to harry to discuss ron which harry found almost more wearing than quidditch lectures at first lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that ron was in the hospital mean i am his unfortunately she had now decided to forgive harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of chats with him about feelings a most uncomfortable experience that harry would have happily forgone 
 
 look why you talk to ron about all this harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from lavender that took in everything from precisely what ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not harry thought that ron considered his relationship with lavender to be serious 
 
 well i would but always asleep when i go and see him said lavender fretfully 
 
 is he said harry surprised for he had found ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of dumbledore and row and keen to abuse mclaggen as much as possible 
 
 is hermione granger still visiting him lavender demanded suddenly 
 
 yeah i think so well friends they said harry uncomfortably 
 
 friends make me laugh said lavender scornfully she talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me but i suppose she wants to make up with him now all interesting 
 
 would you call getting poisoned being interesting asked harry anywaysorry got to mclaggen coming for a talk about quidditch said harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to potions where thankfully neither lavender nor mclaggen could follow him 
 
 on the morning of the quidditch match against hufflepuff harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch ron was very agitated madam pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feeling it would overexcite him 
 
 so mclaggen shaping up he asked harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice 
 
 told you said harry patiently he could be and i want to keep him he keeps trying to tell everyone what to do he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us i wait to be shot of him and speaking of getting shot of people harry added getting to his feet and picking up his firebolt will you stop pretending to be asleep when lavender comes to see you driving me mad as well 
 
 oh said ron looking sheepish yeah all right 
 
 if you want to go out with her anymore just tell her said harry 
 
 yeah well not that easy is it said ron he paused hermione going to look in before the match he added casually 
 
 no already gone down to the pitch with ginny 
 
 oh said ron looking rather glum right well good luck hope you hammer mclagi mean smith 
 
 try said harry shouldering his broom see you after the match 
 
 he hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it he was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful 
 
 malfoy stopped short at the sight of harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking 
 
 you going harry demanded 
 
 yeah really going to tell you because your business potter sneered malfoy better hurry up be waiting for the chosen captainthe boy who scoredwhatever they call you these days 
 
 one of the girls gave an unwilling giggle harry stared at her she blushed malfoy pushed past harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turning the corner and vanishing from view 
 
 harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear this was infuriating he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was malfoy skulking off while the rest of the school was absent best chance yet of discovering what malfoy was up to the silent seconds trickled past and harry remained where he was frozen gazing at the place where malfoy had vanished 
 
 where have you been demanded ginny as harry sprinted into the changing rooms the whole team was changed and ready coote and peakes the beaters were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs 
 
 i met malfoy harry told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head 
 
 so 
 
 so i wanted to know how come up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here 
 
 does it matter right now 
 
 well not likely to find out am i said harry seizing his firebolt and pushing his glasses straight come on then 
 
 and without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos 
 
 there was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight 
 
 tricky conditions mclaggen said bracingly to the team coote peakes want to fly out of the sun so they see you coming 
 
 the captain mclaggen shut up giving them instructions said harry angrily just get up by the goal posts 
 
 once mclaggen had marched off harry turned to coote and peakes 
 
 make sure you do fly out of the sun he told them grudgingly 
 
 he shook hands with the hufflepuff captain and then on madam whistle kicked off and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the snitch if he could catch it good and early there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle seize the map and find out what malfoy was doing 
 
 and smith of hufflepuff with the quaffle said a dreamy voice echoing over the grounds he did the commentary last time of course and ginny weasley flew into him i think probably on purposeit looked like it smith was being quite rude about gryffindor i expect he regrets that now playing themoh look lost the quaffle ginny took it from him i do like her very nice 
 
 harry stared down at the podium surely nobody in their right mind would have let luna lovegood commentate but even from above there was no mistaking that long hair nor the necklace of butterbeer corks beside luna professor mcgonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment 
 
 but now that big hufflepuff got the quaffle from her i remember his name something like bibbleno buggins 
 
 cadwallader said professor mcgonagall loudly from beside luna the crowd laughed 
 
 harry stared around for the snitch there was no sign of it moments later cadwallader scored mclaggen had been shouting criticism at ginny for allowing the quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear 
 
 mclaggen will you pay attention to what supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone bellowed harry wheeling around to face his keeper 
 
 not setting a great example mclaggen shouted back and furious 
 
 and harry now having an argument with his keeper said luna serenely while both hufflepuffs and slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered i think help him find the snitch but maybe a clever ruse 
 
 swearing angrily harry spun round and set off around the pitch again scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball 
 
 ginny and demelza scored a goal apiece giving the supporters below something to cheer about then cadwallader scored again making things level but luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that zacharias smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called lurgy 
 
 to hufflepuff barked professor mcgonagall into megaphone 
 
 is it already said luna vaguely oh look the gryffindor got hold of one of the bats 
 
 harry spun around in midair sure enough mclaggen for reasons best known to himself had pulled bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a bludger toward an oncoming cadwallader 
 
 will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts roared harry pelting toward mclaggen just as mclaggen took a ferocious swipe at the bludger and mishit it 
 
 a blinding sickening pain a flash of light a distant scream and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel 
 
 and the next thing harry knew he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling he raised his head awkwardly there on his left was a freckly person 
 
 nice of you to drop in said ron grinning 
 
 harry blinked and looked around of course he was in the hospital wing the sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson the match must have finished hours ago as had any hope of cornering malfoy head felt strangely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages 
 
 what happened 
 
 cracked skull said madam pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows nothing to worry about i mended it at once but keeping you in overnight you overexert yourself for a few hours 
 
 i want to stay here overnight said harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his covers i want to find mclaggen and kill him 
 
 afraid that would come under the heading of overexertion said madam pomfrey pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner you will stay here until i discharge you potter or i shall call the headmaster 
 
 she bustled back into her office and harry sank back into his pillows fuming 
 
 know how much we lost by he asked ron through clenched teeth 
 
 well yeah i do said ron apologetically final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty 
 
 brilliant said harry savagely really brilliant when i get hold of mclaggen 
 
 you want to get hold of him the size of a troll said ron reasonably personally i think a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the anyway the rest of the team dealt with him before you get out of here not happy 
 
 there was a note of badly suppressed glee in voice harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that mclaggen had messed up so badly harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging 
 
 i could hear the match commentary from here said ron his voice now shaking with laughter i hope luna always commentates from now on lurgy 
 
 but harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while snorts subsided 
 
 ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious he said after a long pause and imagination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in which ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while ron gave them his reckons you only just arrived on time for the match how come you left here early enough 
 
 oh said harry as the scene in his eye imploded yeah well i saw malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who look like they wanted to be with him and the second time made sure he down on the quidditch pitch with the rest of the school he skipped the last match too remember harry sighed wish followed him now the match was such a fiasco 
 
 be stupid said ron sharply you have missed a quidditch match just to follow malfoy the captain 
 
 i want to know what up to said harry and tell me its all in my head not after what i overheard between him and snape 
 
 i never said it was all in your head said ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at harry but no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place getting a bit obsessed with malfoy harry i mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him 
 
 i want to catch him at it said harry in frustration i mean he going when he disappears off the map 
 
 i dunno hogsmeade suggested ron yawning 
 
 never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map i thought they were being watched now anyway 
 
 well then i dunno said ron 
 
 silence fell between them harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him thinking 
 
 if only he had rufus power he would have been able to set a tail upon malfoy but unfortunately harry did not have an office full of aurors at his command he thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons most of them after all still had full schedules 
 
 there was a low rumbling snore from bed after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown it was easiest to feign sleep harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand the lamps dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed 
 
 this was harry reflected in the darkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a quidditch injury last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and the time before that all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept professor lockhart that had been his most painful injury by far he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the 
 
 harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew he had the solution at last there was a way to have malfoy followedhow could he have forgotten why he thought of it before 
 
 but the question was how to call him what did you do quietly tentatively harry spoke into the darkness 
 
 kreacher 
 
 there was a very loud crack and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room ron awoke with a yelp 
 
 going 
 
 harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of madam office and muttered muffliato so that she would not come running then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on 
 
 two were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats the other a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth then there was another loud bang and peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves 
 
 i was watching that potty he told harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle look at the ickle creatures squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy 
 
 kreacher will not insult harry potter in front of dobby no he or dobby will shut mouth for him cried dobby in a voice 
 
 kicky scratchy cried peeves happily now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further tweaky pokey 
 
 kreacher will say what he likes about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy friend of mudbloods oh what would poor mistress say 
 
 exactly what mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment dobby sank his knobbly little fist into mouth and knocked out half of his teeth harry and ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart though they continued to try and kick and punch each other egged on by peeves who swooped around the lamp squealing stick your fingers up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies 
 
 harry aimed his wand at peeves and said langlock peeves clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth 
 
 nice one said ron appreciatively lifting dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with kreacher that was another prince hex it 
 
 yeah said harry twisting wizened arm into a half nelson forbidding you to fight each other well kreacher forbidden to fight dobby dobby i know not allowed to give you orders 
 
 dobby is a free and he can obey anyone he likes and dobby will do whatever harry potter wants him to do said dobby tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper 
 
 okay then said harry and he and ron both released the elves who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting 
 
 master called me croaked kreacher sinking into a bow even as he gave harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death 
 
 yeah i did said harry glancing toward madam office door to check that the muffliato spell was still working there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion got a job for you 
 
 kreacher will do whatever master wants said kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes because kreacher has no choice but kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes 
 
 dobby will do it harry potter squeaked dobby his eyes still swimming in tears dobby would be honored to help harry potter 
 
 come to think of it it would be good to have both of you said harry okay then i want you to tail draco malfoy 
 
 ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on face harry went on i want to know where going who meeting and what doing i want you to follow him around the clock 
 
 yes harry potter said dobby at once his great eyes shining with excitement and if dobby does it wrong dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower harry potter 
 
 there be any need for that said harry hastily 
 
 master wants me to follow the youngest of the malfoys croaked kreacher master wants me to spy upon the of my old mistress 
 
 the one said harry foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately and forbidden to tip him off kreacher or to show him what up to or to talk to him at all or to write him messages or or to contact him in any way got it 
 
 he thought he could see kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited after a moment or two and to great satisfaction kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment master thinks of everything and kreacher must obey him even though kreacher would much rather be the servant of the malfoy boy oh yes 
 
 settled then said harry want regular reports but make sure not surrounded by people when you turn up ron and hermione are okay and tell anyone what doing just stick to malfoy like a couple of wart plasters 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the silver doecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 it was snowing by the time hermione took over the watch at midnight harrys dreams were confused and disturbing nagini wove in and out of them first through a wreath of christmas roses he woke repeatedly panicky convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices 
 
 finally he got up in the darkness and joined hermione who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading a history of magic by the light of her wand the snow was falling thickly and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on 
 
 well move somewhere more sheltered she agreed shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas i kept thinking i could hear people moving outside i even though i saw somebody one or twice 
 
 harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent motionless sneakoscope on the table 
 
 im sure i imagined it said hermione looking nervous the snow the dark it plays tricks on your eyes but perhaps we ought to disapparate under the invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 half an hour later with the tent packed harry wearing the horcrux and hermione clutching the beaded bag they disapparated the usual tightness engulfed them harrys feet parted company with the snowy ground then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in leaves 
 
 where are we he asked peering around at the fresh mass of trees as hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles 
 
 the forest of dean she said i came camping here once with my mum and dad 
 
 here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold but they were at least protected from the wind they spent most of the day inside the tent huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that hermione was adept at producing and which could be scooped up and carried in a jar harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe an impression reinforced by hermiones solicitousness that afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow 
 
 after two nights of little sleep harrys senses seemed more alert than usual their escape from godrics hollow had been so narrow that voldemort seemed somehow closer than before more threatening as darkness drove in again harry refused hermiones offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed 
 
 harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so still shivery the darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable he was on the point of taking out the marauders map so as to watch ginnys dot for a while before he remembered that it was the christmas holidays and that she would be back at the burrow 
 
 every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest harry knew that it must be full of living creatures but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister movements he remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself their protective enchantments had worked for weeks why should they break now and yet he could no throw off the feeling that something was different tonight 
 
 several times he jerked upright his neck aching because he had fallen asleep slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent the night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between disapparation and apparation he had just held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened 
 
 a bright silver light appeared right ahead of him moving through the trees whatever the source it was moving soundlessly the light seemed simply to drift toward him 
 
 he jumped to his feet his voice frozen in his throat and raised hermiones wand he screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette and still the thing came closer 
 
 and then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak it was a silver white doe and dazzling picking her way over the ground still silent and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow she stepped toward him her beautiful head with its wide eyes held high 
 
 harry stared at the creature filled with wonder not at her strangeness but her inexplicable familiarity he felt that he had been waiting for her to come but that he had forgotten until this moment that they had arranged to meet his impulse to shout for hermione which had been so strong a moment ago had gone he knew he would have staked his life on it that she had come for him and him alone 
 
 they gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away 
 
 no he said and his voice was cracked with lack of use come back 
 
 she continued to step deliberately through the trees and soon he brightness was striped by their thick black trunks for one trembling second he hesitated caution murmured it could be a trick a lure a trap but instinct overwhelming instinct told him that this was not dark magic he set off in pursuit 
 
 snow crunched beneath his feet but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees for she was nothing but light deeper and deeper into the forest she led him and harry walked quickly sure that when she stopped she would allow him to approach her properly and then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know 
 
 at last she came to a halt she turned her beautiful head toward him once more and he broke into a run a question burning in him but as he opened his lips to ask it she vanished 
 
 though the darkness had swallowed her whole her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas it obscured his vision brightening when he lowered his eyelids disorienting him now fear came her presence had meant safety 
 
 lumos he whispered and the ignited 
 
 the imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there listening to the sounds of the forest to distant crackles of twigs soft swishes of snow was he about to be attacked had she enticed him into an ambush was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight watching him 
 
 he held the wand higher nobody ran out at him no flash of green light burst from behind a tree why then had she led him to this spot 
 
 something gleamed in the light of the wand and harry spun about but all that was there was a small frozen pool its black cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it 
 
 he moved forward rather cautiously and looked down the ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misty gray carapace something else glinted a great silver cross 
 
 his heart skipped into his mouth he dropped to his knees at the pools edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible a glint of deep redit was a sword with glittering rubies in its sword of gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool 
 
 barely breathing he stared down at it how was this possible how could it have come to be lying in a forest pool this close to the place where they were camping had some unknown magic drawn hermione to this spot or was the doe which he had taken to be a patronus some kind of guardian of the pool or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived precisely because they were here in which case where was the person who wanted to pass it to harry again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes searching for a human outline for the glint of an eye but he could not see anyone there all the same a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool 
 
 he pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured accio sword 
 
 it did not stir he had not expected it to if it had been that easy the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up not in the depths of a frozen pool he set off around the circle of ice thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him he had been in terrible danger then and had asked for help 
 
 help he murmured but the sword remained upon the pool bottom indifferent motionless 
 
 what was it harry asked himself walking again that dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat and what were the qualities that defined a gryffindor a small voice inside harrys head answered him their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindor apart 
 
 harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air he knew what he had to do if he was honest with himself he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice 
 
 he glanced around at the surrounding trees again but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him they had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool the only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting 
 
 with fumbling fingers harry started to remove his many layers of clothing where chivalry entered into this he thought ruefully he was not entirely sure unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for hermione to do it in his stead 
 
 an owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off and he thought with a pang of hedwig he was shivering now his teeth chattering horribly and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear barefooted in the snow he placed the pouch containing his wand his mothers letter the shard of siriuss mirror and the old snitch on top of his clothes then he pointed hermiones wand at the ice 
 
 diffindo 
 
 it cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence the surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water as far as harry could judge it was not deep but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely 
 
 contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer he stepped to the pools edge and placed hermiones wand on the ground still lit then trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering he jumped 
 
 every pore of his body screamed in protest the very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water he could hardly breathe trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool he felt for the blade with his numb feet he only wanted to dive once 
 
 harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second gasping and shaking until he told himself that it must be done gathered all his courage and dived 
 
 the cold was agony it attacked him like fire his brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out groping for the sword his fingers closed around the hilt he pulled it upward 
 
 then something closed tight around his neck he thought of water weeds though nothing had brushed him as he dived and raised his hand to free himself it was not weed the chain of the horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe 
 
 harry kicked out wildly trying to push himself back to the surface but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool thrashing suffocating he scrabbled at the strangling chain his frozen fingers unable to loosen it and now little lights were popping inside his head and he was going to drown there was nothing left nothing he could do and the arms that closed around his chest were surely deaths 
 
 choking and retching soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life he came to facedown in the snow somewhere close by another person was panting and coughing and staggering around as she had come when the snake it did not sound like her not with those deep coughs no judging by the weight of the footsteps 
 
 harry had no strength to lift his head and see his saviors identity all he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh it was gone someone had cut him free then a panting voice spoke from over his head 
 
 are c you c mental 
 
 nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given harry the strength to get up shivering violently he staggered to his feet there before him stood ron fully dressed but drenched to the skin his hair plastered to his face the sword of gryffindor in one hand and the horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other 
 
 why the hell panted ron holding up the horcrux which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis didnt you take the thing off before you dived 
 
 harry could not answer the silver doe was nothing nothing compared with rons reappearance he could not believe it shuddering with cold he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the waters edge and began to pull them on as he dragged sweater after sweater over his head harry stared at ron half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him and yet he had to be real he had just dived into the pool he had saved harrys life 
 
 it was harry said at last his teeth chattering his voice weaker than usual due to his 
 
 well yeah said ron looking slightly confused 
 
 cast that doe 
 
 what no of course not i thought it was you doing it 
 
 my patronus is a stag 
 
 oh yeah i thought it looked different no antlers 
 
 harry put hagrids pouch back around his neck pulled on a final sweater stooped to pick up hermiones wand and faced ron again 
 
 how come youre here 
 
 apparently ron had hoped that this point would come up later if at all 
 
 well ive c you know c ive come back if c he cleared his throat you know you still want me 
 
 there was a pause in which the subject of rons departure seemed to rise like a wall between them yet he was here he had returned he had just saved harrys life 
 
 ron looked down at his hands he seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding 
 
 oh yeah i got it out he said rather unnecessarily holding up the sword for harrys inspection thats why you jumped in right 
 
 yeah said harry but i dont understand how did you get here how did you find us 
 
 long story said ron ive been looking for you for hours its a big forest isnt it and i was just thinking id have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when i saw that dear coming and you following 
 
 you didnt see anyone else 
 
 no said ron i c 
 
 but he hesitated glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away 
 
 i did think i saw something move over there but i was running to the pool at the time because youd gone in and you hadnt come up so i wasnt going to make a detour to c hey 
 
 harry was already hurrying to the place that ron had indicated the two oaks grew close together there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level an ideal place to see but not be seen the ground around the roots however was free of snow and harry could see no sign of footprints he walked back to where ron stood waiting still holding the sword and the horcrux 
 
 anything there ron asked 
 
 no said harry 
 
 so how did the sword get in that pool 
 
 whoever cast the patronus must have put it there 
 
 they both looked at the ornate silver sword its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from hermiones wand 
 
 you reckon this is the real one asked ron 
 
 one way to find out isnt there said harry 
 
 the horcrux was still swinging from rons hand the locket was twitching slightly harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again it had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill harry rather than let him possess it now was not the time for long discussions now was the moment to destroy once and for all harry looked around holding hermiones wand high and saw the place a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree 
 
 come here he said and he led the way brushed snow from the rocks surface and held out his hand for the horcrux when ron offered the sword however harry shook his head 
 
 no you should do it 
 
 me said ron looking shocked why 
 
 because you got the sword out of the pool i think its supposed to be you 
 
 he was not being kind or generous as certainly as he had known that the doe was benign he knew that ron had to be the one to wield the sword dumbledore had at least taught harry something about certain kinds of magic of the incalculable power of certain acts 
 
 im going to open it said harry and you will stab it straightaway okay because whatevers in there will put up a fight the bit of riddle in the diary tried to kill me 
 
 how are you going to open it asked ron he looked terrified im going to ask it to open using parseltongue said harry the answer came so readily to his lips that thought that he had always known it deep down perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with nagini to make him realize it he looked at the serpentine s inlaid with glittering green stones it was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake curled upon the cold rock 
 
 no said ron dont open it im serious 
 
 why not asked harry lets get rid of the damn thing its been months c 
 
 i cant harry im serious c you do it c 
 
 but why 
 
 because that things bad for me said ron backing away from the locket on the rock i cant handle it im not making excuses for what i was like but it affects me worse than it affects you and hermione it made me think stuff c stuff that i was thinking anyway but it made everything worse i cant explain it and then id take it off and id get my head straight again and then id have to put the effing thing back on c i cant do it harry 
 
 he had backed away the sword dragging at his side shaking his head 
 
 you can do it said harry you can youve just got the sword i know its supposed to be you who uses it please just get rid of it ron 
 
 the sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant ron swallowed then still breathing hard through his long nose moved back toward the rock 
 
 tell me when he croaked 
 
 on three said harry looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes concentrating on the letter s imagining a serpent while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach it would have been easy to pity it except that the cut around harrys neck still burned 
 
 one two threeopen 
 
 the last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open with a little click 
 
 behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye dark and handsome as tom riddles eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and stab said harry holding the locket steady on the rock 
 
 ron raised the sword in his shaking hands the point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes and harry gripped the locket tightly bracing himself already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows 
 
 then a voice hissed from out the horcrux 
 
 i have seen your heart and it is mine 
 
 dont listen to it harry said harshly stab it 
 
 i have seen your dreams ronald weasley and i have seen your fears all you desire is possible but all that you dread is also possible 
 
 stab shouted harry his voice echoed off the surrounding trees the sword point trembled and ron gazed down into riddles eyes 
 
 least loved always by the mother who craved a daughter least loved now by the girl who prefers your friend second best always eternally overshadowed 
 
 ron stab it now harry bellowed he could feel the locket quivering in the grip and was scared of what was coming ron raised the sword still higher and as he did so riddles eyes gleamed scarlet 
 
 out of the lockets two windows out of the eyes there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles the heads of harry and hermione weirdly distorted 
 
 ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket first chests then waists then legs until they stood in the locket side by side like trees with a common root swaying over ron and the real harry who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned suddenly 
 
 ron he shouted but the was now speaking with voldemorts voice and ron was gazing mesmerized into its face 
 
 why return we were better without you happier without you glad of your absence we laughed at your stupidity your cowardice your presumptionc 
 
 presumption echoed the who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real hermione she swayed cackling before ron who looked horrified yet transfixed the sword hanging pointlessly at his side who could look at you who would ever look at you beside harry potter what have you ever done compared with the chosen one what are you compared with the boy who lived 
 
 ron stab it stab it harry yelled but ron did not move his eyes were wide and the and the were reflected in them their hair swirling like flames their eyes shining red their voices lifted in an evil duet 
 
 your mother confessed sneered while jeered that she would have preferred me as a son would be glad to exchange 
 
 who wouldnt prefer him what woman would take you you are nothing nothing nothing to him crooned and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around wrapping him in a close embrace their lips met 
 
 on the ground in front of them rons face filled with anguish he raised the sword high his arms shaking 
 
 do it ron harry yelled 
 
 ron looked toward him and harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes 
 
 ron c 
 
 the sword flashed plunged harry threw himself out of the way there as a clang of metal and a long scream harry whirled around slipping in the snow wand held ready to defend himself but there was nothing to fight 
 
 the monstrous versions of himself and hermione were gone there was only ron standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock 
 
 slowly harry walked back to him hardly knowing what to say or do ron was breathing heavily his eyes were no longer red at all but their normal blue they were also wet 
 
 harry stooped pretending he had not seen and picked up the broken horcrux ron had pierced the glass in both windows riddles eyes were gone and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly the thing that had lived in the horcrux had vanished torturing ron had been its final act the sword clanged as ron dropped it he had sunk to his knees his head in his arms he was shaking but not harry realized from cold harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket knelt down beside ron and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder he took it as a good sign that ron did not throw it off 
 
 after you left he said in a low voice grateful for the fact that rons face was hidden she cried for a week probably longer only she didnt want me to see there were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other with you gone 
 
 he could not finish it was now that ron was here again that harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them 
 
 shes like my sister he went on i love her like a sister and i reckon that she feels the same way about me its always been like that i thought you knew 
 
 ron did not respond but turned his face away from harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve harry got to his feet again and walked to where rons enormous rucksack lay yards away discarded as ron had run toward the pool to save harry from drowning he hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to ron who clambered to his feet as harry approached eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed 
 
 im sorry he said in a thick voice im sorry i left i know i was a c a c 
 
 he looked around at the darkness as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him 
 
 youve sort of made up for it tonight said harry getting the sword finishing off the horcrux saving my life 
 
 that makes me sound a lot cooler than i was ron mumbled 
 
 stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was said harry ive been trying to tell you that for years 
 
 simultaneously they walked forward and hugged harry gripping the back of rons jacket 
 
 and now said harry as they broke apart all weve got to do is find that tent again 
 
 but it was not difficult though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy with ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time harry could not wait to wake hermione and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent ron lagging a little behind him 
 
 it was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor hermione was fast asleep curled up under her blankets and did not move until harry had said her name several times 
 
 hermione 
 
 she stirred then sat up quickly pushing her hair out of her face 
 
 whats wrong harry are you all right 
 
 its okay everythings fine more than fine im great theres someone here 
 
 what do you mean who c 
 
 she saw ron who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet harry backed into a shadowy corner slipped off rons rucksack and attempted to blend in with the canvas 
 
 hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward ron her eyes upon his pale face she stopped right in front of him her lips slightly parted her eyes wide ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms 
 
 hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach 
 
 ouch c ow c gerroff what the c hermione c ow 
 
 you c complete c arse c ronald c weasley 
 
 she punctuated every word with a blow ron backed away shielding his head as hermione advanced 
 
 you c crawl c back c here c after c weeks c and c weeks c oh wheres my wand 
 
 she looked as though ready to wrestle it out of harrys hands and he reacted instinctively 
 
 protego 
 
 the invisible shield erupted between ron and hermione the force of it knocked her backward onto the floor spitting hair out of her mouth she lept up again 
 
 hermione said harry calm c 
 
 i will not calm down she screamed never before had he seen her lose control like this she looked quite demented give me back my wand give it back to me 
 
 hermione will you please c 
 
 dont you tell me what do harry potter she screeched dont you dare give it back now and you 
 
 she was pointing at ron in dire accusation it was like a malediction and harry could not blame ron for retreating several steps 
 
 i cam running after you i called you i begged you to come back 
 
 i know ron said hermione im sorry im really c 
 
 oh youre sorry 
 
 she laughed a sound ron looked at harry for help but harry merely grimaced his helplessness 
 
 you came back after weeks c weeks c and you think its all going to be all right if you just say sorry 
 
 well what else can i say ron shouted and harry was glad that ron was fighting back 
 
 oh i dont know yelled hermione with awful sarcasm rack your brains ron that should only take a couple of seconds c 
 
 hermione interjected harry who considered this a low blow he just saved my c 
 
 i dont care she screamed i dont care what hes done weeks and weeks we could have been dead for all he knew c 
 
 i knew you werent dead bellowed ron drowning her voice for the first time and approaching as close as he could with the shield charm between them harrys all over the prophet all over the radio theyre looking for you everywhere all these rumors and mental stories i knew id hear straight off if you were dead you dont know what its been like c 
 
 what its been like for you 
 
 her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless and ron seized his opportunity 
 
 i wanted to come back the minute id disapparated but i walked straight into a gang of snatchers hermione and i couldnt go anywhere 
 
 a gang of what asked harry as hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years 
 
 snatchers said ron theyre everywhere c gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up and blood traitors theres a reward from the ministry for everyone captured i was on my own and i look like i might be school age they got really excited thought i was a in hiding i had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the ministry 
 
 what did you say to them 
 
 told them i was stan shunpike first person i could think of 
 
 and they believed that 
 
 they werent the brightest one of them was definitely part troll the smell of him 
 
 ron glanced at hermione clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs 
 
 anyway they had a row about whether i was stan or not it was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and theyd taken my wand then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted i managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach grabbed his wand disarmed the bloke holding mine and disapparated i didnt do it so well splinched myself again c ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails hermione raised her eyebrows coldly c and i came out miles from where you were by the time i got back to that bit of riverbank where wed been you were gone 
 
 gosh what a gripping story hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound you must have been simply terrified meanwhile we went to godrics hollow and lets think what happened there harry oh yes snake turned up it nearly killed both of us and then himself arrived and missed us by about a second 
 
 what ron said gaping from her to harry but hermione ignored him 
 
 imagine losing fingernails harry that really puts our sufferings into perspective doesnt it 
 
 hermione said harry quietly ron just saved my life 
 
 she appeared not to have heard him 
 
 one thing i would like to know though she said fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over rons head how exactly did you find us tonight thats important once we know well be able to make sure were not visited by anyone else we dont want to see 
 
 ron glared at her then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket 
 
 this 
 
 she had to look at ron to see what he was showing them 
 
 the deluminator she asked so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce 
 
 it doesnt just turn the lights on and off said ron i dont know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time because ive been wanting to come back ever since i left but i was listening to the radio really early on christmas morning and i heard i heard you 
 
 he was looking at hermione 
 
 you heard me on the radio she asked incredulously 
 
 no i heard you coming out of my pocket your voice he held up the deluminator again came out of this 
 
 and what exactly did i say asked hermione her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity 
 
 my name ron and you said something about a wand 
 
 hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet harry remembered it had been the first time rons name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing harrys wand 
 
 so i took it out ron went on looking at the deluminator and it didnt seem different or anything but i was sure id heard you so i clicked it and the light went out in my room but another light appeared right outside the window 
 
 ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him his eyes focused on something neither harry nor hermione could see 
 
 it was a ball of light kind of pulsing and bluish like that light you get around a portkey you know 
 
 yeah said harry and hermione together automatically 
 
 i knew this was it said ron i grabbed my stuff and packed it then i put on my rucksack and went out into the garden 
 
 the little ball of light was hovering there waiting for me and when i came out it bobbed along a bit and i followed it behind the shed and then it well it went inside me 
 
 sorry said harry sure he had not heard correctly 
 
 it sort of floated toward me said ron illustrating the movement with his free index finger right to my chest and then c it just went straight through it was here he touched a point close to his heard i could feel it it was hot and once it was inside me i knew what i was supposed to do i knew it would take me where i needed to go so i disapparated and came out on the side of a hill there was snow everywhere 
 
 we were there said harry we spent two nights there and the second night i kept thinking i could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out 
 
 yeah well that wouldve been me said ron your protective spells work anyway because i couldnt see you and i couldnt hear you i was sure you were around though so in the end i got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear i thought youd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent 
 
 no actually said hermione weve been disapparating under the invisibility cloak as an extra precaution and we left really early because as harry says wed heard somebody blundering around 
 
 well i stayed on that hill all day said ron i kept hoping youd appear but when it started to get dark i knew i must have missed you so i clicked the deluminator again the blue light came out and went inside me and i disapparated and arrived here in these woods i still couldnt see you so i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end c and harry did well i saw the doe first obviously 
 
 you saw the what said hermione sharply 
 
 they explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded hermione frowned form one to the other of them concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together 
 
 but it must have been a patronus she said couldnt you see who was casting it didnt you see anyone and it led you to the sword i cant believe this then what happened 
 
 ron explained how he had watched harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface how he had realized that something was wrong dived in and saved harry then returned for the sword he got as far as the opening of the locket then hesitated and harry cut in 
 
 c and ron stabbed it with the sword 
 
 and and it went just like that she whispered 
 
 well it c it screamed said harry with half a glance at ron here 
 
 he threw the locket into her lap gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows 
 
 deciding that it was at last safe to do so harry removed the shield charm with a wave of hermiones wand and turned to ron 
 
 did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand 
 
 what said ron who had been watching hermione examining the locket oh c oh yeah 
 
 he tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket here i figured its always handy to have a backup 
 
 you were right said harry holding out his hand mines broken 
 
 youre kidding ron said but at that moment hermione got to her feet and he looked apprehensive again 
 
 hermione put the vanquished horcrux into the beaded bag then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word 
 
 ron passed harry the new wand 
 
 about the best you could hope for i think murmured harry 
 
 yeah said ron couldve been worse remember those birds she set on me 
 
 i still havent ruled it out came hermiones muffled voice from beneath her blankets but harry saw ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 jack the dullard 
 an old story told anew 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far in the interior of the country lay an old baronial hall and 
 in it lived an old proprietor who had two sons which two young men 
 thought themselves too clever by half they wanted to go out and woo the daughter for the maiden in question had publicly announced that she would choose for her husband that youth who could arrange his words best 
 
 so these two geniuses prepared themselves a full week for the 
 wooing this was the longest time that could be granted them but it 
 was enough for they had had much preparatory information and 
 everybody knows how useful that is one of them knew the whole latin dictionary by heart and three whole years of the daily paper of the little town into the bargain and so well indeed that he could 
 repeat it all either backwards or forwards just as he chose the 
 other was deeply read in the corporation laws and knew by heart 
 what every corporation ought to know and accordingly he thought he 
 could talk of affairs of state and put his spoke in the wheel in 
 the council and he knew one thing more he could embroider suspenders with roses and other flowers and with arabesques for he was a tasty fellow 
 
 i shall win the princess so cried both of them therefore their 
 old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse the youth who knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black horse and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a steed then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with so that they might become very smooth and glib all the servants stood below in the courtyard and looked on while they mounted their horses and just by chance the third son came up for the proprietor had really three sons though nobody counted the third with his brothers because he was not so learned as they and indeed he was generally known as jack the dullard 
 
 hallo said jack the dullard where are you going i declare 
 you have put on your sunday clothes 
 
 going to the court as suitors to the 
 daughter you know the announcement that has been made all 
 through the country and they told him all about it 
 
 my word be in it too cried jack the dullard and his 
 two brothers burst out laughing at him and rode away 
 
 father dear said jack i must have a horse too i do feel 
 so desperately inclined to marry if she accepts me she accepts me 
 and if she have me have her but she shall be mine 
 
 talk nonsense replied the old gentleman you shall 
 have no horse from me you know how to speak you 
 arrange your words your brothers are very different fellows from 
 you 
 
 well quoth jack the dullard if i have a horse 
 take the who belongs to me and he can carry me very 
 well 
 
 and so said so done he mounted the pressed his heels 
 into its sides and galloped down the high street like a hurricane 
 hei houp that was a ride here i come shouted jack the 
 dullard and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide 
 
 but his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him they spoke 
 not a word for they were thinking about the fine extempore speeches 
 they would have to bring out and these had to be cleverly prepared 
 beforehand 
 
 hallo shouted jack the dullard here am i look what i have 
 found on the high road and he showed them what it was and it was 
 a dead crow 
 
 dullard exclaimed the brothers what are you going to do 
 with that 
 
 with the crow why i am going to give it to the princess 
 
 yes do so said they and they laughed and rode on 
 
 hallo here i am again just see what i have found now you 
 find that on the high road every day 
 
 and the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now 
 
 dullard they cried that is only an old wooden shoe and the 
 upper part is missing into the bargain are you going to give that 
 also to the princess 
 
 most certainly i shall replied jack the dullard and again 
 the brothers laughed and rode on and thus they got far in advance 
 of him but 
 
 hallo hop rara and there was jack the dullard again it is 
 getting better and better he cried hurrah it is quite famous 
 
 why what have you found this time inquired the brothers 
 
 oh said jack the dullard i can hardly tell you how glad 
 the princess will be 
 
 bah said the brothers that is nothing but clay out of the 
 ditch 
 
 yes certainly it is said jack the dullard and clay of the 
 finest sort see it is so wet it runs through fingers and he 
 filled his pocket with the clay 
 
 but his brothers galloped on till the sparks flew and 
 consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town gate than 
 could jack now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number 
 and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival six in 
 each row and so closely packed together that they could not move 
 their arms and that was a prudent arrangement for they would 
 certainly have come to blows had they been able merely because one of them stood before the other 
 
 all the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great 
 crowds around the castle almost under the very windows to see the 
 princess receive the suitors and as each stepped into the hall his 
 power of speech seemed to desert him like the light of a candle 
 that is blown out then the princess would say he is of no use away with him out of the hall 
 
 at last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary 
 by heart but he did not know it now he had absolutely forgotten it 
 altogether and the boards seemed to with his footsteps and 
 the ceiling of the hall was made of so that he saw 
 himself standing on his head and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk and every one of them was writing down every single word that was uttered so that it might be printed in the newspapers and sold for a penny at the street corners it was a terrible ordeal and they had moreover made such a fire in the stove that the room seemed quite red hot 
 
 it is dreadfully hot here observed the first brother 
 
 yes replied the princess my father is going to roast young 
 pullets today 
 
 baa there he stood like a he had not been prepared 
 for a speech of this kind and had not a word to say though he 
 intended to say something witty baa 
 
 he is of no use said the princess away with him 
 and he was obliged to go accordingly and now the second brother 
 came in 
 
 it is terribly warm here he observed 
 
 yes roasting pullets replied the princess 
 
 what what were you were you pleased to ob stammered he and 
 all the clerks wrote down pleased to ob 
 
 he is of no use said the princess away with him 
 now came the turn of jack the dullard he rode into the hall on 
 his goat 
 
 well most abominably hot here 
 
 yes because roasting young pullets replied the princess 
 
 ah lucky exclaimed jack the dullard for i suppose 
 let me roast my crow at the same time 
 
 with the greatest pleasure said the princess but have you 
 anything you can roast it in for i have neither pot nor pan 
 
 certainly i have said jack a cooking utensil with a 
 tin handle 
 
 and he brought out the old wooden shoe and put the crow into it 
 
 well that is a famous dish said the princess but what 
 shall we do for sauce 
 
 oh i have that in my pocket said jack i have so much of it 
 that i can afford to throw some away and he poured some of the 
 clay out of his pocket 
 
 i like that said the princess you can give an answer and you 
 have something to say for yourself and so you shall be my husband 
 but are you aware that every word we speak is being taken down and 
 will be published in the paper look yonder and you will 
 see in every window three clerks and a head clerk and the old head 
 clerk is the worst of all for he understand anything 
 
 but she only said this to frighten jack the dullard and the 
 clerks gave a great crow of delight and each one spurted a blot out 
 of his pen on to the floor 
 
 oh those are the gentlemen are they said jack then i will 
 give the best i have to the head clerk and he turned out his 
 pockets and flung the wet clay full in the head face 
 
 that was very cleverly done observed the princess i could not 
 have done that but i shall learn in time 
 
 and accordingly jack the dullard was made a king and received a 
 crown and a wife and sat upon a throne and this report we have wet 
 from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of printers 
 but they are not to be depended upon in the least

who then will speak for the common good 
 barbara jordan 
 democratic national convention keynote address 
 delivered july new york ny 
 thank you ladies and gentlemen for a very warm reception 
 it was one hundred and years ago that members of the democratic party first met in convention to select a presidential candidate since that time democrats have continued to convene once every four years and draft a party platform and nominate a presidential candidate and our meeting this week is a continuation of that tradition but there is something different about tonight there is something special about tonight what is different what is special 
 i barbara jordan am a keynote speaker 
 a lot of years passed since and during that time it would have been most unusual for any national political party to ask that a barbara jordan to deliver a keynote address but tonight here i am and i feel that notwithstanding the past that my presence here is one additional bit of evidence that the american dream need not forever be deferred 
 now that i have this grand distinction what in the world am i supposed to say i could easily spend this time praising the accomplishments of this party and attacking the republicans but i choose to do that i could list the many problems which americans have i could list the problems which cause people to feel cynical angry frustrated problems which include lack of integrity in government the feeling that the individual no longer counts the reality of material and spiritual poverty the feeling that the grand american experiment is failing or has failed i could recite these problems and then i could sit down and offer no solutions but i choose to do that either the citizens of america expect more they deserve and they want more than a recital of problems 
 we are a people in a quandary about the present we are a people in search of our future we are a people in search of a national community we are a people trying not only to solve the problems of the present unemployment inflation but we are attempting on a larger scale to fulfill the promise of america we are attempting to fulfill our national purpose to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal 
 throughout out history when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems and to uphold the principles of this nation many times they have turned to political parties they have often turned to the democratic party what is it what is it about the democratic party that makes it the instrument the people use when they search for ways to shape their future well i believe the answer to that question lies in our concept of governing our concept of governing is derived from our view of people it is a concept deeply rooted in a set of beliefs firmly etched in the national conscience of all of us 
 now what are these beliefs first we believe in equality for all and privileges for none this is a belief that each american regardless of background has equal standing in the public forum all of us because we believe this idea so firmly we are an inclusive rather than an exclusive party let everybody come i think it no accident that most of those emigrating to america in the th century identified with the democratic party we are a heterogeneous party made up of americans of diverse backgrounds 
 we believe that the people are the source of all governmental power that the authority of the people is to be extended not restricted 
 this can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government they must have that we believe we believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people not just one interest group but all the people has an obligation to actively underscore actively seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement obstacles emanating from race sex economic condition the government must remove them seek to remove them 
 we are a party of innovation we do not reject our traditions but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances when change we must we are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future we have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of america can one day be finally closed 
 we believe that 
 this my friends is the bedrock of our concept of governing this is a part of the reason why americans have turned to the democratic party these are the foundations upon which a national community can be built all understand that these guiding principles cannot be discarded for political gains they represent what this country is all about they are indigenous to the american idea and these are principles which are not negotiable 
 in other times i could stand here and give this kind of exposition on the beliefs of the democratic party and that would be enough but today that is not enough people want more that is not sufficient reason for the majority of the people of this country to vote democratic we have made mistakes we realize that in our haste to do all things for all people we did not foresee the full consequences of our actions and when the people raised their voices we hear but our deafness was only a temporary condition and not an irreversible condition 
 even as i stand here and admit that we have made mistakes i still believe that as the people of america sit in judgment on each party they will recognize that our mistakes were mistakes of the heart recognize that 
 and now we must look to the future let us heed the voice of the people and recognize their common sense if we do not we not only blaspheme our political heritage we ignore the common ties that bind all americans many fear the future many are distrustful of their leaders and believe that their voices are never heard many seek only to satisfy their private work wants to satisfy their private interests but this is the great danger america faces that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups city against suburb region against region individual against individual each seeking to satisfy private wants if that happens who then will speak for america who then will speak for the common good 
 this is the question which must be answered in 
 are we to be one people bound together by common spirit sharing in a common endeavor or will we become a divided nation for all of its uncertainty we cannot flee the future we must not become the new puritans and reject our society we must address and master the future together it can be done if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community that we share a common national endeavor it can be done 
 there is no executive order there is no law that can require the american people to form a national community this we must do as individuals and if we do it as individuals there is no president of the united states who can veto that decision 
 as a first step we must restore our belief in ourselves we are a generous people so why we be generous with each other we need to take to heart the words spoken by thomas jefferson 
 let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life are but dreary things 
 a nation is formed by the willingness of each of us to share in the responsibility for upholding the common good a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation in this election year we must define the common good and begin again to shape a common future let each person do his or her part if one citizen is unwilling to participate all of us are going to suffer for the american idea though it is shared by all of us is realized in each one of us 
 and now what are those of us who are elected public officials supposed to do we call ourselves public servants but tell you this we as public servants must set an example for the rest of the nation it is hypocritical for the public official to admonish and exhort the people to uphold the common good if we are derelict in upholding the common good more is required of public officials than slogans and handshakes and press releases more is required we must hold ourselves strictly accountable we must provide the people with a vision of the future 
 if we promise as public officials we must deliver if we as public officials propose we must produce if we say to the american people it is time for you to be sacrificial sacrifice if the public official says that we public officials must be the first to give we must be and again if we make mistakes we must be willing to admit them we have to do that what we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do everything and that idea the belief that government ought to do nothing strike a balance let there be no illusions about the difficulty of forming this kind of a national community tough difficult not easy but a spirit of harmony will survive in america only if each of us remembers that we share a common destiny if each of us remembers when and bitterness seem to prevail that we share a common destiny 
 i have confidence that we can form this kind of national community 
 i have confidence that the democratic party can lead the way 
 i have that confidence 
 we cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by the founders of the republic there is no way to improve upon that but what we can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize our destiny 
 now i began this speech by commenting to you on the uniqueness of a barbara jordan making a keynote address well i am going to close my speech by quoting a republican president and i ask you that as you listen to these words of abraham lincoln relate them to the concept of a national community in which every last one of us participates 
 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy 
 thank you 


 
 
 
 part two 
 chapter 
 
 toward the end of winter in the house of the shcherbatskys a consultation was being held which was to determine the state of health and what was to be done to restore her failing strength she had been ill and as spring came on she grew worse the family doctor gave her oil then iron then lunar caustic but since neither the first nor the second nor the third availed and since his advice was to go abroad before the beginning of the spring a celebrated doctor was called in the celebrated doctor not yet old and a very handsome man demanded an examination of the patient he maintained with special satisfaction it seemed that maiden modesty is merely a relic of barbarism and that nothing could be more natural than for a man who was not yet old to handle a young girl in the nude he deemed this natural because he did it every day and neither felt nor thought as it seemed to him anything evil as he did it and consequently he considered girlish modesty not merely as a relic of barbarism but as well an insult to himself 
 it was necessary to submit for although all the doctors studied in the same school all using the same textbooks and all learned in the same science and though some people said this celebrated doctor was but a poor doctor in the household and circle it was for some reason held that this celebrated doctor alone had some peculiar knowledge and that he alone could save kitty after thorough examination and tapping of the patient distraught and dazed with shame the celebrated doctor having painstakingly washed his hands was standing in the drawing room talking to the prince the prince frowned and coughed as he listened to the doctor as a man who had seen something of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he had no faith in medicine and at soul was wrought up with all this comedy especially as he was probably the only one who fully understood the cause of illness barking up the wrong tree he mentally applied this phrase from the vocabulary to the celebrated doctor as he listened to the patter about the symptoms of his complaint the doctor for his part found difficulty in restraining the expression of his contempt for this old grandee as well as in condescending to the low level of his comprehension he perceived that it was useless to talk to the old man and that the head of this house was the mother and she it was before whom he intended to scatter his pearls it was at this point that the princess entered the drawing room with the family doctor the prince retreated doing his best not to betray how ridiculous he regarded the whole comedy the princess was distraught and did not know what to do she felt herself at fault before kitty 
 well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything is there any hope was what she had wanted to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter this question well doctor 
 immediately princess i will discuss the matter with my colleague and then have the honor of laying my opinion before you 
 then we had better leave you 
 as you please 
 the princess with a sigh stepped outside 
 when the doctors were left alone the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion that there was an incipient tubercular process but and so on the celebrated doctor listened to him and in the middle of the speech looked at his big gold watch 
 that is so said he but 
 the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his speech 
 as you know we cannot determine the incipience of the tubercular process until the appearance of vomicae there is nothing determinate but we may suspect it and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on the question stands thus if we suspect a tubercular process what must we do to maintain nutrition 
 but then you know there are always moral spiritual causes at the back of these cases the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile 
 yes to be taken for granted retorted the celebrated doctor again glancing at his watch beg pardon but is the iauzsky bridge finished yet or must one still make a detour he asked ah it is finished well in that case i can make it in twenty minutes as we were saying the question may be posited thus the nutrition must be maintained and the nerves improved the one is bound with the other one must work upon both sides of this circle 
 but what about the trip abroad asked the family doctor 
 i am a foe to trips abroad and take notice if there is any incipient tubercular process which we cannot know a trip abroad will not help we must have a remedy that would improve nutrition and do no harm 
 and the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with soden waters in designating which his main end was evidently their harmlessness 
 the family doctor heard him out attentively and respectfully 
 but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions which evoke memories and then the mother wishes it he added 
 ah well in that case one might go well let them go but those german charlatans may do harm our instructions ought to be followed well let them go then 
 he again glanced at his watch 
 oh time to go and he went to the door 
 the celebrated doctor informed the princess prompted by a feeling of propriety that he must see the patient once more 
 what another examination the mother exclaimed in horror 
 oh no i merely need certain details princess 
 come this way 
 and the mother followed by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty wasted and blushing with a peculiar glitter in her eyes a consequence of the shame she had gone through kitty was standing in the middle of the room when the doctor came in she turned crimson and her eyes filled with tears all her illness and its treatment seemed to her a thing so stupid even funny treatment seemed to her as funny as reconstructing the pieces of a broken vase it was her heart that was broken why then did they want to cure her with pills and powders but she could not hurt her mother all the more so since her mother considered herself to blame 
 may i trouble you to sit down princess the celebrated doctor said to her 
 smiling he sat down facing her felt her pulse and again started in with his tiresome questions she answered him and suddenly becoming angry got up 
 you must pardon me doctor but really this will lead us nowhere you ask me the same things three times running 
 the celebrated doctor did not take umbrage 
 sickly irritability said he to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished

 toward the end of winter in the house of the shcherbatskys a consultation was being held which was to determine the state of health and what was to be done to restore her failing strength she had been ill and as spring came on she grew worse the family doctor gave her oil then iron then lunar caustic but since neither the first nor the second nor the third availed and since his advice was to go abroad before the beginning of the spring a celebrated doctor was called in the celebrated doctor not yet old and a very handsome man demanded an examination of the patient he maintained with special satisfaction it seemed that maiden modesty is merely a relic of barbarism and that nothing could be more natural than for a man who was not yet old to handle a young girl in the nude he deemed this natural because he did it every day and neither felt nor thought as it seemed to him anything evil as he did it and consequently he considered girlish modesty not merely as a relic of barbarism but as well an insult to himself 
 it was necessary to submit for although all the doctors studied in the same school all using the same textbooks and all learned in the same science and though some people said this celebrated doctor was but a poor doctor in the household and circle it was for some reason held that this celebrated doctor alone had some peculiar knowledge and that he alone could save kitty after thorough examination and tapping of the patient distraught and dazed with shame the celebrated doctor having painstakingly washed his hands was standing in the drawing room talking to the prince the prince frowned and coughed as he listened to the doctor as a man who had seen something of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he had no faith in medicine and at soul was wrought up with all this comedy especially as he was probably the only one who fully understood the cause of illness barking up the wrong tree he mentally applied this phrase from the vocabulary to the celebrated doctor as he listened to the patter about the symptoms of his complaint the doctor for his part found difficulty in restraining the expression of his contempt for this old grandee as well as in condescending to the low level of his comprehension he perceived that it was useless to talk to the old man and that the head of this house was the mother and she it was before whom he intended to scatter his pearls it was at this point that the princess entered the drawing room with the family doctor the prince retreated doing his best not to betray how ridiculous he regarded the whole comedy the princess was distraught and did not know what to do she felt herself at fault before kitty 
 well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything is there any hope was what she had wanted to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter this question well doctor 
 immediately princess i will discuss the matter with my colleague and then have the honor of laying my opinion before you 
 then we had better leave you 
 as you please 
 the princess with a sigh stepped outside 
 when the doctors were left alone the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion that there was an incipient tubercular process but and so on the celebrated doctor listened to him and in the middle of the speech looked at his big gold watch 
 that is so said he but 
 the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his speech 
 as you know we cannot determine the incipience of the tubercular process until the appearance of vomicae there is nothing determinate but we may suspect it and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on the question stands thus if we suspect a tubercular process what must we do to maintain nutrition 
 but then you know there are always moral spiritual causes at the back of these cases the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile 
 yes to be taken for granted retorted the celebrated doctor again glancing at his watch beg pardon but is the iauzsky bridge finished yet or must one still make a detour he asked ah it is finished well in that case i can make it in twenty minutes as we were saying the question may be posited thus the nutrition must be maintained and the nerves improved the one is bound with the other one must work upon both sides of this circle 
 but what about the trip abroad asked the family doctor 
 i am a foe to trips abroad and take notice if there is any incipient tubercular process which we cannot know a trip abroad will not help we must have a remedy that would improve nutrition and do no harm 
 and the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with soden waters in designating which his main end was evidently their harmlessness 
 the family doctor heard him out attentively and respectfully 
 but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions which evoke memories and then the mother wishes it he added 
 ah well in that case one might go well let them go but those german charlatans may do harm our instructions ought to be followed well let them go then 
 he again glanced at his watch 
 oh time to go and he went to the door 
 the celebrated doctor informed the princess prompted by a feeling of propriety that he must see the patient once more 
 what another examination the mother exclaimed in horror 
 oh no i merely need certain details princess 
 come this way 
 and the mother followed by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty wasted and blushing with a peculiar glitter in her eyes a consequence of the shame she had gone through kitty was standing in the middle of the room when the doctor came in she turned crimson and her eyes filled with tears all her illness and its treatment seemed to her a thing so stupid even funny treatment seemed to her as funny as reconstructing the pieces of a broken vase it was her heart that was broken why then did they want to cure her with pills and powders but she could not hurt her mother all the more so since her mother considered herself to blame 
 may i trouble you to sit down princess the celebrated doctor said to her 
 smiling he sat down facing her felt her pulse and again started in with his tiresome questions she answered him and suddenly becoming angry got up 
 you must pardon me doctor but really this will lead us nowhere you ask me the same things three times running 
 the celebrated doctor did not take umbrage 
 sickly irritability said he to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished 
 and the doctor scientifically defined to the princess as to an exceptionally clever woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by explaining the mode of drinking the unnecessary waters when the question of going abroad came up the doctor was plunged into profound considerations as though deciding a weighty problem finally his decision was given they might go abroad but must put no faith in charlatans but turn to him in everything 
 it seemed as though some cheerful influence had sprung up after the departure the mother grew more cheerful when she returned to her daughter while kitty too pretended to be more cheerful she had frequent almost constant occasions to be pretending now 
 really quite well maman but if you want to go abroad she said and trying to show that she was interested in the proposed trip she began talking of the preparations for the departure

 right after the doctor dolly arrived she knew that the consultation was scheduled for that day and despite the fact that she had only recently gotten up from her she had had another little girl at the end of the winter despite her having enough trouble and cares of her own she had left her breast baby and an ailing girl to come and learn fate which was being decided that day 
 well what said she entering into the drawing room without taking off her hat all in good spirits that means good news then 
 an attempt was made to tell her what the doctor had said but it proved that even though the doctor had talked coherently and long it was utterly impossible to convey what he had said the only point of interest was that going abroad was definitely decided upon 
 dolly could not help sighing her dearest friend her sister was going away and her life was far from gay her relations with stepan arkadyevich after their reconciliation had become humiliating the welding anna had made proved not at all solid and family concord had broken down again at the same point there was nothing definite but stepan arkadyevich was hardly ever at home also there was hardly ever any money and dolly was constantly being tortured by suspicions of infidelities and by now she drove them away from her dreading the agony of jealousy she had already experienced the first explosion of jealousy once lived through could never return and even the discovery of infidelities could never affect her now as it had the first time such a discovery now would only mean breaking up her family habits and she permitted him to deceive her despising him and still more herself for this weakness besides this the cares of her large family were a constant torment to her now the nursing of her breast baby did not go well now the nurse would leave now as at the present time one of the children would fall ill 
 well everybody in your family asked her mother 
 ah maman we have enough trouble of our own lili has taken ill and afraid scarlatina i have come here now to find out about kitty and then i shall shut myself up entirely if god forbid it really be scarlatina 
 the old prince too had come in from his study after the departure and after offering his cheek to dolly and chatting awhile with her he turned to his wife 
 what have you decided are you going well and what do you want to do with me 
 i think you had better stay here alexandre said his wife 
 just as you wish 
 maman why father come with us said kitty feel better and so will we 
 the old prince got up and stroked hair she lifted her head and looked at him with a forced smile it always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone else in the family did though he spoke but little with her being the youngest she was her favorite and she fancied that his love for her gave him insight when now her gaze met his blue kindly eyes scrutinizing her intently it seemed to her that he saw right through her and understood all the evil things that were at work within her reddening she was drawn toward him expecting a kiss but he merely patted her hair and said 
 these silly chignons one as much as get near real daughter but simply stroke the hair of defunct females well dolinka he turned to his elder daughter your ace up to now 
 nothing papa answered dolly who knew that this referred to her husband always out i hardly ever see him she could not resist adding with a mocking smile 
 why he gone into the country yet about the sale of the forest 
 no still getting ready 
 oh it said the prince and so to be getting ready too at your service he said to his wife sitting down and as for you katia he went on addressing his younger daughter you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself why quite well and merry and going out again with papa for an early morning stroll in the frost eh 
 what her father said seemed simple enough yet at these words kitty grew confused and upset like a criminal caught yes he knows all he understands all and in these words telling me that though ashamed i must live through my shame she could not pluck up spirit enough to make any answer she made an attempt but suddenly burst into tears and ran out of the room 
 see what comes of your jokes the princess pounced on her husband always she launched into her reproachful speech 
 the prince listened to the reproaches rather a long while and kept silent but his face grew more and more glowering 
 so much to be pitied poor thing so much to be pitied yet you feel how it pains her to hear the least hint as to the cause of it all ah to be so mistaken in people said the princess and by the change in her tone both dolly and the prince knew she meant vronsky i know why there laws against such vile dishonorable people 
 ah i to listen to you said the prince glumly getting up from his chair as if to go yet pausing in the doorway there are laws my dear and since challenged me to it tell you to blame for it all you you you alone laws against such young gallants have always existed and still exist yes if there anything that ought not to have been i old as i am would have called him out to the barrier this swell yes and now go ahead and physic her and call in these charlatans 
 the prince it seemed had plenty more to say but no sooner had the princess caught his tone than she subsided at once and became penitent as was always the case in serious matters 
 alexandre alexandre she whispered approaching him and bursting into tears 
 as soon as she began to weep the prince too calmed down he went up to her 
 there enough enough you feel badly too i know nothing can be done about it not so very bad god is merciful thanks he said without knowing himself what he was saying now responding to the moist kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand and the prince went out of the room 
 no sooner had kitty gone out of the room in tears than dolly with her motherly domestic habit had promptly perceived that here a work lay before her and got ready for it she took off her hat and morally speaking tucked up her sleeves and got ready for action while her mother was attacking her father she tried to restrain her mother so far as daughterly reverence would allow during the outburst she was silent she felt ashamed for her mother and tender toward her father for so quickly being kind again but when her father left she made ready for what was most necessary to go to kitty and compose her 
 intended long since to tell you something maman did you know that levin meant to propose to kitty when he was here last he told stiva so 
 well what of it i understand 
 why perhaps kitty refused him did she say nothing to you 
 no she said nothing to me either of the one or the other too proud but i know all on account of this 
 yes but suppose she has refused levin and she have refused him if it been for the other i know and then this fellow has deceived her so horribly 
 it was too frightful for the princess to think how much at fault she was before her daughter and she grew angry 
 oh now i really understand nothing nowadays everybody thinks to live after his own way a mother told a thing and then you have 
 maman go to her 
 do am i forbidding you

 when she went into little sanctum a pretty rosy little room full of knickknacks in vieux saxe as youthful and rosy and gay as kitty herself had been only two months ago dolly recalled how they had together decorated the room the year before with what gaiety and love her heart turned cold when she beheld kitty sitting on the low chair nearest the door her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug kitty glanced at her sister and the cold rather austere expression of her face did not change 
 going now and shall entrench myself at home and you be able to come to see me said darya alexandrovna sitting down beside her i want to talk to you 
 what about kitty asked swiftly lifting her head in fright 
 what should it be save grieving you 
 i have no grief 
 come kitty do you possibly think i cannot know i know all and believe me this is so insignificant all been through it 
 kitty did not speak and her face had a stern expression 
 not worth your suffering on his account pursued darya alexandrovna coming straight to the point 
 yes because he has disdained me said kitty in a jarring voice say anything please say anything 
 but whoever told you that no one has said that certain he was in love with you and remained in love with you but 
 oh the most awful thing of all for me are these condolences cried out kitty in a sudden fit of anger she turned round on her chair turned red and her fingers moved quickly as she pinched the buckle of the belt she held now with one hand now with the other dolly knew this trick her sister had of grasping something in turn with each of her hands when in excitement she knew that in a moment of excitement kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much and much that was unpleasant and dolly would have calmed her but it was already too late 
 what what is it you want to make me feel eh said kitty quickly that been in love with a man who even care to know me and that dying for love of him and this is said to me by my own sister who imagines that that that sympathizing with me i want these condolences and hypocrisies 
 kitty unjust 
 why do you torment me 
 but i on the contrary i can see hurt 
 but kitty in her heat did not hear her 
 nothing to despair over and be comforted about sufficiently proud never to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me 
 why i say anything of the kind only tell me the truth said darya alexandrovna taking her by the hand tell me did levin speak to you 
 the mention of levin seemed to deprive kitty of the last vestige of she leaped up from her chair and flinging the buckle to the ground gesticulating rapidly with her hands she said 
 why bring levin in too i understand what you want to torture me for told you and i repeat it i have some pride and never never would i do what doing going back to a man deceived you who has come to love another woman i understand this you may but i do it 
 and having said these words she glanced at her sister and seeing that dolly sat silent her head mournfully bowed kitty instead of leaving the room as she had intended sat down near the door and hiding her face in her shawl let her head drop 
 the silence lasted for two minutes thoughts were of herself that humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with special pain when her sister reminded her of it she had not expected such cruelty from her sister and was resentful but suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt and simultaneously an outburst of smothered sobbing and felt arms clasping her neck from below kitty was on her knees before her 
 dolinka i am so so unhappy she whispered penitently 
 and the endearing face covered with tears hid itself in darya skirt 
 it was as if tears were the indispensable oil without which the machinery of mutual communion could not run smoothly between the two sisters the sisters after their tears discussed everything but that which engrossed them but even in talking of outside matters they understood one another kitty knew that what she had uttered in anger about her infidelity and her humiliating position had struck her poor sister to the very depths of her heart but she also knew that the latter had forgiven her dolly for her part had comprehended all she had wanted to find out she had become convinced that her surmises were correct that misery her incurable misery was due precisely to the fact that levin had proposed to her and she had refused him while vronsky had deceived her and that she stood ready to love levin and to hate vronsky kitty said no word of this she spoke of nothing save her own spiritual state 
 i have nothing to grieve over she said calming down but you could understand that everything has become loathsome hateful coarse to me and i myself most of all you imagine what loathsome thoughts i have about everything 
 why whatever loathsome thoughts can you have asked dolly smiling 
 most most loathsome and coarse i tell you this is not melancholy nor boredom but far worse as if everything of good that i had were gone out of sight while only that which was most loathsome were left well how shall i put it to you she went on seeing incomprehension in her eyes papa began saying something to me just now it seems to me he thinks all i need is to marry if mamma takes me to a ball it seems to me she takes me only to marry me off as fast as possible and get me off her hands i know this so but i drive away such thoughts these suitors so called i bear the sight of them it seems to me as if always taking stock of me formerly to go anywhere in a ball dress was a downright joy to me i used to admire myself now i feel ashamed in at ease well take any example you like this doctor now 
 kitty hesitated she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her stepan arkadyevich had become unbearably repulsive to her and that she could not see him without imagining the grossest and most hideous things 
 well now everything appears to me in the coarsest most loathsome aspect she went on that is my ailment perhaps all this will pass 
 try not to think of such things 
 i help it i feel well only when i am with the children at your house 
 what a pity you visit me 
 oh yes come had scarlatina and persuade maman to let me come 
 kitty insisted on having her way and went to stay at her and nursed the children all through the scarlatina for it really proved to be scarlatina the two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it health however did not improve and in lent the shcherbatskys went abroad

 another small circle with which anna was intimate was the one by means of which alexei alexandrovich had made his career the center of this circle was the countess lidia ivanovna this was a circle of elderly homely virtuous and pious women and clever learned and ambitious men one of the clever people belonging to this small circle had called it the conscience of peterburg society alexei alexandrovich appreciated this circle very much and anna who knew so well how to get on with all had in the early days of her life in peterburg found friends even in this circle but now upon her return from moscow this set had become unbearable to her it seemed to her that both she and all of them were dissimulating and she experienced such boredom and lack of ease in their society that she tried to visit the countess lidia ivanovna as infrequently as possible 
 and finally the third circle with which anna had ties was the really fashionable world the world of balls of dinners of sumptuous dresses the world that hung on to the court with one hand in order not to sink to the level of the demimonde which the members of the fashionable world believed they despised yet the tastes of both were not only similar but precisely the same her connection with this circle was maintained through princess betsy tverskaia her wife who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles and who had taken a great liking to anna ever since she first came out looking after her and drawing her into her own circle poking fun at that of countess lidia ivanovna

 anna had at first avoided as much as she could princess world because it necessitated expenditures above her means and besides at soul she preferred the first circle but after her trip to moscow things fell out quite the other way she avoided her moral friends and went out into the fashionable world there she would meet vronsky and experienced an agitating joy at such meetings especially often did she meet vronsky at for betsy was a vronsky by birth and his cousin vronsky went everywhere where he might meet anna and at every chance he had spoke to her of his love she offered him no encouragement yet every time she met him there was kindled in her soul that same feeling of animation which had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she had seen him for the first time she felt herself that her delight shone in her eyes and puckered her lips into a smile and she could not quench the expression of this delight 
 at first anna had sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her but not long after her return from moscow on arriving at a soiree where she had anticipated meeting him yet not finding him there she realized clearly from the feeling of sadness which overcame her that she had been deceiving herself and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her but that it constituted all the interest of her life 
 it was the second performance of a celebrated cantatrice and all the fashionable world was in the theater vronsky seeing his cousin from his seat in the front row did not wait till the but went to her box 
 why you come to dinner she said to him i marvel at this clairvoyance of lovers she added with a smile so that no one but he could hear she there but do come after the opera 
 vronsky looked inquiringly at her she nodded he thanked her by a smile and sat down beside her 
 but how i remember your jeers continued princess betsy who took special delight in following up the progress of this passion become of all that caught my dear fellow 
 my one desire to be caught answered vronsky with his calm smile if i complain at all only that not caught enough if the truth were told i begin to lose hope 
 why whatever hope can you expect said betsy offended on behalf of her friend entendons nous but in her eyes flitted gleams of light which proclaimed that she understood very well even as much as he did what hope he might entertain 
 none whatever said vronsky laughing and showing his closely set teeth excuse me he added taking the binoculars out of her hand and proceeding to scrutinize over her bare shoulder the row of boxes opposite them afraid becoming ridiculous 
 he was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of betsy and all other fashionable people he was very well aware that in the eyes of these people the role of the hapless lover of a girl or in general of any woman free to marry might be ridiculous but the role of a man pursuing a married woman and regardless of everything staking his life on drawing her into adultery that role has something beautiful and majestic about it and can never be ridiculous and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the binoculars and looked at his cousin 
 but why you come to dinner she said admiring him 
 i must tell you about that i was busy and with what do you suppose give you a hundred guesses a thousand never guess been reconciling a husband with a man insulted his wife yes really 
 well did you reconcile them 
 almost 
 you really must tell me about it she said getting up come to me in the next

 this is rather indiscreet but so charming that one is awfully tempted to tell the story said vronsky looking at her with laughing eyes i intend to mention any names 
 but i shall guess them so much the better 
 listen then two festive young men were driving along 
 officers of your regiment of course 
 i say they were officers just two young men who had been lunching 
 in other words drinking 
 possibly they were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the gayest of moods and they catch sight of a pretty woman in a hired sleigh who overtakes them looks back at them and so it seemed to them at any rate nods to them and laughs they of course follow her galloping at full speed to their amazement the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going the fair one darts upstairs to the top floor all they got was a glimpse of rosebud lips under a short veil and of exquisite little feet 
 you tell this with such feeling that it seems to me you yourself must have been one of the two 
 but what did you tell me just now well the young men enter their apartment he was giving a farewell dinner there they certainly did take a drop too much as is always the case at farewell dinners and at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house no one knows only their valet in answer to their inquiry whether any young ladies are living on the top floor answered that there were a great many of them after dinner the two young men go into their study and write a letter to the fair unknown they composed a passionate epistle really a declaration and then carry the letter upstairs themselves so as to explain whatever might prove not altogether clear in the letter 
 why do you tell me such nasty things and then 
 they ring a maidservant opens the door they hand her the letter and assure her that both so enamored that die on the spot at the door the maid stupefied carries on the negotiations suddenly a gentleman appears with side whiskers like country sausages he is as red as a lobster and informing them that there is no one living in that flat except his wife he sends them both packing 
 how do you know he had side whiskers like sausages as you put it 
 ah do but listen recently i went to make peace between them 
 well and what was the upshot 
 the most interesting part this couple turned out to be a most happy one a government clerk and his lady the government clerk lodges a complaint whereupon i become a mediator and what a mediator i assure you talleyrand was a nobody compared to me 
 just what was the difficulty 
 ah do but listen we make fitting apologies we are in despair we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding the government clerk with the country sausages begins to melt and he too desires to express his sentiments but no sooner does he begin to express them than he gets heated and says nasty things and again obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents i agree that their action was bad but i beg of you to take into consideration the misunderstanding and their youth besides the young men had just come from their lunch you understand their repentance is heartfelt and they beg you to forgive their misbehavior the government clerk was softened once more i consent count and am ready to forgive but you must understand that my wife my wife a respectable woman is subjected to annoyances and insults and impertinences by certain milksops scou yet you understand the milksop is present and it is up to me to make peace between them again i trot out all my diplomacy and again just as the matter is about to be concluded our friend the government clerk gets heated and turns red while his country sausages bristle up and i once more exert diplomatic finesse 
 ah you must hear this story said betsy laughing to a lady who was entering the box he has made me laugh so much well bonne chance she added giving vronsky the one finger free from holding her fan and with a shrug of her shoulders letting down the bodice of her gown that had worked up so as to be fittingly and fully nude as she moved forward toward the footlights into the lights of the gas and within the ken of all 
 vronsky drove to the french theater where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment who never missed a single performance there he wanted to talk over his peacemaking which had been occupying and amusing him for the last three days petritsky whom he liked was implicated in the affair as well as another fine fellow and excellent comrade who had lately joined the regiment the young prince kedrov but mainly the interests of the regiment were involved as well 
 both culprits were in squadron the colonel of the regiment had received a call from the government clerk venden with a complaint against his officers who had insulted his wife his young wife as venden told the story he had been married half a year had been at church with her mother and suddenly feeling indisposed due to her interesting condition found that she could not remain standing and drove home in the first sleigh with the mettlesome coachman she came across it was then that the officers set off in pursuit of her she was alarmed and feeling still worse ran home up the staircase venden himself on returning from his office had heard a ring at their bell and voices had stepped out and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter he had pushed them out he was asking that the culprits be severely punished 
 you may say what you will said the colonel to vronsky whom he had invited to come and see him petritsky is becoming impossible not a week goes by without some scrape this clerk chap let matters drop go on with the thing 
 vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business and that a duel was out of the question here that everything must be done to soften this government clerk and hush the matter up the colonel had called in vronsky precisely because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man but above all one to whom the honor of the regiment was dear they talked it over and decided that petritsky and kedrov must go with vronsky to this government clerk and apologize the colonel and vronsky were both fully aware that name and insignia of were bound to go a long way toward softening the government clerk and these two influences proved in fact not without effect though the result of the mediation remained as vronsky had described uncertain 
 on reaching the french theater vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel and reported to him his success or lack of it the colonel thinking it all over decided not to go on with the matter but then for his own delectation proceeded to question vronsky about the details of his interview and for a long while could not restrain his laughter as he listened to story of how the government clerk after subsiding for a while would suddenly flare up again as he recalled the details and how vronsky at the last of conciliation had skillfully maneuvered a retreat shoving petritsky out before him 
 a disgraceful scrape but a killing one kedrov really fight this gentleman so he was awfully wrought up he asked again laughing but what do you think of claire today a wonder he went on speaking of a new french actress no matter how often you see her different each time only the french who can do that

 princess betsy drove home from the theater without waiting for the end of the last act she had just time enough to go into her dressing room sprinkle her long pale face with powder rub it off set her dress to rights and order tea in the big drawing room when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house on the bolshaia morskaia her guests dismounted at the wide entrance and the stout porter who used to read newspapers mornings behind the glass door to the edification of the noiselessly opened the immense door letting the visitors pass by him into the house 
 almost at the same instant that the hostess with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face entered at one door her guests entered at the other into the drawing room a large room with dark walls downy rugs and a brightly lighted table gleaming with the light of candles the whiteness of napery the silver of the samovar and the tea service of transparent porcelain 
 the hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves chairs were set with the aid of footmen moving almost imperceptibly about the room the party settled itself divided into two groups one round the samovar near the hostess the other at the opposite end of the drawing room round the handsome wife of an ambassador in black velvet with sharply defined black eyebrows in both groups conversation wavered as it always does for the first few minutes broken up by meetings salutations offers of tea and as it were seeking for some point in common 
 exceptionally fine as an actress one can see studied kaulbach said a diplomatist in the circle of the wife did you notice how she fell down 
 oh please let us talk about nilsson no one can possibly say anything new about her said a fat lady without eyebrows and without chignon wearing an old silk dress this was princess miaghkaia noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners and nicknamed enfant terrible princess miaghkaia was seated halfway between the two groups and listening to both took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today just as though they had conspired and i know why that phrase should be so much to their liking 
 the conversation was cut short by this observation and again a new subject had to be thought of 
 do tell us something amusing yet not spiteful said the wife a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english small talk she addressed the diplomatist who was now at a loss just what to begin upon 
 that is said to be a difficult task only that which is spiteful is supposed to be amusing he began with a smile however make the attempt give me a theme all a matter of the theme if the theme be but given easy enough to embroider it i often think that the celebrated conversationalists of the last century would find it difficult to talk cleverly now everything clever has become such a bore 
 that has been said long ago the wife interrupted him laughing 
 the conversation had begun amiably but just because it was too amiable it came to a stop again they had to have recourse to the sure remedy malicious gossip 
 you think something louis quinze about tushkevich he said glancing toward a handsome young man standing at the table 
 oh yes in the same style as the drawing room and why it is so often here 
 this conversation was kept up since it depended on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say of the relations of tushkevich with their hostess 
 round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having in the meanwhile vacillated in precisely the same way between the three inevitable topics the latest piece of public news the theater and censuring the fellow creature had finally come to rest on the last topic that is malicious gossip 
 have you heard that even the maltishcheva the mother not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color 
 impossible no just charming 
 i wonder that with her sense for after all no fool she see how funny she is 
 every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the hapless maltishcheva and the conversation crackled merrily like a blazing bonfire 
 the husband of princess betsy a corpulent man an ardent collector of engravings hearing that his wife had visitors had come into the drawing room before leaving for his club stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs he approached princess miaghkaia 
 how did you like nilsson he asked 
 oh how can you steal up on anyone like that how you startled me she responded please talk to me about the opera you know nothing about music rather come down to your own level and discuss with you your majolica and engravings come now what treasure have you been buying lately at the rag fair 
 would you like me to show you but you understand such things 
 yes show me been learning about them at those their names those bankers they have some splendid engravings they showed them to us 
 why have you been at the schutzburgs asked the hostess from behind the samovar 
 yes ma chre they asked my husband and myself to dinner and i was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand roubles princess miaghkaia said speaking loudly conscious that all were listening and very nasty sauce it was some green mess we had to ask them and i made a sauce for kopecks and everybody was very much pleased with it i afford sauces 
 unique said the lady of the house 
 amazing somebody else added 
 the effect produced by princess speeches was always the same and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately as now she said homely truths not devoid of sense in the society in which she lived such utterances had the same result as the most pungent wit princess miaghkaia could never see why it had that result but she knew it had and took advantage of it 
 since everyone had been listening while princess miaghkaia spoke and the conversation around the wife had dropped princess betsy tried to bring the whole party together and she addressed the wife 
 really you have tea do come and join us 
 no very comfortable here the wife responded with a smile and went on with the interrupted conversation 
 it was a most agreeable conversation they were censuring the karenins husband and wife 
 anna is quite changed since her stay in moscow something strange about her said one of her feminine friends 
 the great change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of alexei vronsky said the wife 
 well what of it a fable of about a man without a shadow a man deprived of his shadow as a punishment for something or other i never could understand just how this was a punishment yet a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow 
 yes but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end said friend 
 bite your tongue said princess miaghkaia suddenly karenina is a splendid woman i like her husband but her i like very much 
 why you like her husband such a remarkable man said the wife my husband says there are few statesmen like him in europe 
 and my husband tells me just the same but i believe it said princess miaghkaia if our husbands talk to us we should see the facts as they are alexei alexandrovich to my thinking is simply a fool i say it in a whisper but it really make everything clear before when i was told to consider him clever i kept looking for his ability and thought myself a fool for not seeing it but directly i said a fool though only in a whisper everything became clear that so 
 how spiteful you are today 
 not a bit no other way out of it one of us two had to be the fool and as you know one could never say that of oneself 
 no one is satisfied with his fortune and everyone is satisfied with his wit the diplomatist repeated the french saying 
 it just it princess miaghkaia turned to him promptly but the point is that i abandon anna to your mercies such a dear so charming how can she help it if all in love with her and follow her about like shadows 
 oh i had no idea of censuring her friend said in 
 if we have no shadows following us it does not prove that any right to blame her 
 and having duly disposed of friend the princess miaghkaia got up and together with the wife joined the group at the table where the general conversation had to do with the king of prussia 
 what were you gossiping so maliciously about asked betsy 
 about the karenins the princess gave us a character sketch of alexei alexandrovich said the wife with a smile as she sat down at the table 
 pity we hear it said princess betsy glancing toward the door ah here you are at last she said turning with a smile to vronsky who was entering 
 vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here he saw them all every day and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people whom one had left only a short while ago 
 where do i come from he repeated the question of the wife well no help for it i must confess from the opera bouffe i do believe seen it a hundred times and always with fresh enjoyment exquisite i know disgraceful but i go to sleep at the opera yet i sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute and enjoy it this evening 
 he mentioned a french actress and was about to tell something about her but the wife with playful trepidation cut him short 
 please tell us about that horror 
 very well i especially as everyone knows those horrors 
 and we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing like the opera chimed in princess miaghkaia

 almost at the same instant that the hostess with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face entered at one door her guests entered at the other into the drawing room a large room with dark walls downy rugs and a brightly lighted table gleaming with the light of candles the whiteness of napery the silver of the samovar and the tea service of transparent porcelain 
 the hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves chairs were set with the aid of footmen moving almost imperceptibly about the room the party settled itself divided into two groups one round the samovar near the hostess the other at the opposite end of the drawing room round the handsome wife of an ambassador in black velvet with sharply defined black eyebrows in both groups conversation wavered as it always does for the first few minutes broken up by meetings salutations offers of tea and as it were seeking for some point in common 
 exceptionally fine as an actress one can see studied kaulbach said a diplomatist in the circle of the wife did you notice how she fell down 
 oh please let us talk about nilsson no one can possibly say anything new about her said a fat lady without eyebrows and without chignon wearing an old silk dress this was princess miaghkaia noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners and nicknamed enfant terrible princess miaghkaia was seated halfway between the two groups and listening to both took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today just as though they had conspired and i know why that phrase should be so much to their liking 
 the conversation was cut short by this observation and again a new subject had to be thought of 
 do tell us something amusing yet not spiteful said the wife a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english small talk she addressed the diplomatist who was now at a loss just what to begin upon 
 that is said to be a difficult task only that which is spiteful is supposed to be amusing he began with a smile however make the attempt give me a theme all a matter of the theme if the theme be but given easy enough to embroider it i often think that the celebrated conversationalists of the last century would find it difficult to talk cleverly now everything clever has become such a bore 
 that has been said long ago the wife interrupted him laughing 
 the conversation had begun amiably but just because it was too amiable it came to a stop again they had to have recourse to the sure remedy malicious gossip 
 you think something louis quinze about tushkevich he said glancing toward a handsome young man standing at the table 
 oh yes in the same style as the drawing room and why it is so often here 
 this conversation was kept up since it depended on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say of the relations of tushkevich with their hostess 
 round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having in the meanwhile vacillated in precisely the same way between the three inevitable topics the latest piece of public news the theater and censuring the fellow creature had finally come to rest on the last topic that is malicious gossip 
 have you heard that even the maltishcheva the mother not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color 
 impossible no just charming 
 i wonder that with her sense for after all no fool she see how funny she is 
 every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the hapless maltishcheva and the conversation crackled merrily like a blazing bonfire 
 the husband of princess betsy a corpulent man an ardent collector of engravings hearing that his wife had visitors had come into the drawing room before leaving for his club stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs he approached princess miaghkaia 
 how did you like nilsson he asked 
 oh how can you steal up on anyone like that how you startled me she responded please talk to me about the opera you know nothing about music rather come down to your own level and discuss with you your majolica and engravings come now what treasure have you been buying lately at the rag fair 
 would you like me to show you but you understand such things 
 yes show me been learning about them at those their names those bankers they have some splendid engravings they showed them to us 
 why have you been at the schutzburgs asked the hostess from behind the samovar 
 yes ma chre they asked my husband and myself to dinner and i was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand roubles princess miaghkaia said speaking loudly conscious that all were listening and very nasty sauce it was some green mess we had to ask them and i made a sauce for kopecks and everybody was very much pleased with it i afford sauces 
 unique said the lady of the house 
 amazing somebody else added 
 the effect produced by princess speeches was always the same and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately as now she said homely truths not devoid of sense in the society in which she lived such utterances had the same result as the most pungent wit princess miaghkaia could never see why it had that result but she knew it had and took advantage of it 
 since everyone had been listening while princess miaghkaia spoke and the conversation around the wife had dropped princess betsy tried to bring the whole party together and she addressed the wife 
 really you have tea do come and join us 
 no very comfortable here the wife responded with a smile and went on with the interrupted conversation 
 it was a most agreeable conversation they were censuring the karenins husband and wife 
 anna is quite changed since her stay in moscow something strange about her said one of her feminine friends 
 the great change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of alexei vronsky said the wife 
 well what of it a fable of about a man without a shadow a man deprived of his shadow as a punishment for something or other i never could understand just how this was a punishment yet a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow 
 yes but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end said friend 
 bite your tongue said princess miaghkaia suddenly karenina is a splendid woman i like her husband but her i like very much 
 why you like her husband such a remarkable man said the wife my husband says there are few statesmen like him in europe 
 and my husband tells me just the same but i believe it said princess miaghkaia if our husbands talk to us we should see the facts as they are alexei alexandrovich to my thinking is simply a fool i say it in a whisper but it really make everything clear before when i was told to consider him clever i kept looking for his ability and thought myself a fool for not seeing it but directly i said a fool though only in a whisper everything became clear that so 
 how spiteful you are today 
 not a bit no other way out of it one of us two had to be the fool and as you know one could never say that of oneself 
 no one is satisfied with his fortune and everyone is satisfied with his wit the diplomatist repeated the french saying 
 it just it princess miaghkaia turned to him promptly but the point is that i abandon anna to your mercies such a dear so charming how can she help it if all in love with her and follow her about like shadows 
 oh i had no idea of censuring her friend said in 
 if we have no shadows following us it does not prove that any right to blame her 
 and having duly disposed of friend the princess miaghkaia got up and together with the wife joined the group at the table where the general conversation had to do with the king of prussia 
 what were you gossiping so maliciously about asked betsy 
 about the karenins the princess gave us a character sketch of alexei alexandrovich said the wife with a smile as she sat down at the table 
 pity we hear it said princess betsy glancing toward the door ah here you are at last she said turning with a smile to vronsky who was entering 
 vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here he saw them all every day and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people whom one had left only a short while ago 
 where do i come from he repeated the question of the wife well no help for it i must confess from the opera bouffe i do believe seen it a hundred times and always with fresh enjoyment exquisite i know disgraceful but i go to sleep at the opera yet i sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute and enjoy it this evening 
 he mentioned a french actress and was about to tell something about her but the wife with playful trepidation cut him short 
 please tell us about that horror 
 very well i especially as everyone knows those horrors 
 and we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing like the opera chimed in princess miaghkaia

 chapter 
 
 steps were heard at the door and princess betsy knowing it was madame karenina glanced at vronsky he was looking toward the door and his face wore a strange new expression joyfully intently and at the same time timidly he gazed at the approaching figure and slowly he rose to his feet anna walked into the drawing room holding herself extremely erect as always looking straight before her and moving with her swift resolute and light step that distinguished her walk from that of other society women she crossed the few paces that separated her from her hostess shook hands with her smiled and with the same smile looked around at vronsky vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her 
 she acknowledged this only by a slight nod flushed and frowned but immediately while rapidly greeting her acquaintances and shaking the hands proffered to her she addressed princess betsy 
 i have been at countess and meant to have come here earlier but i stayed on sir john was there a most interesting man 
 oh this missionary 
 yes he told us about life in india most interestingly 
 the conversation interrupted by her coming in flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out 
 sir john yes sir john seen him he speaks well vlassieva is altogether in love with him 
 and is it true that the younger vlassieva is to marry topov 
 yes they say quite settled 
 i wonder at the parents they say a marriage of passion 
 of passion what antediluvian notions you have whoever talks of passion nowadays said the wife 
 what would you do this silly old fashion is still far from dead said vronsky 
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence 
 yes but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages is scattered like dust precisely because that passion to which recognition has been denied appears on the scene said vronsky 
 but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already like scarlatina one has to go through with it and get it over with 
 in that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love like 
 i was in love in my young days with a church clerk said the princess miaghkaia i know that it did me any good 
 no i think all jokes aside that to know love one must first make a fault and then mend it said princess betsy 
 even after marriage said the wife playfully 
 never too late to mend the diplomatist repeated the english proverb 
 just so betsy agreed one must make a mistake and rectify it what do you think about it she turned to anna who with a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips was listening to the conversation 
 i think said anna playing with the glove she had taken off i think if there are as many minds as there are heads then surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts 
 vronsky was gazing at anna and with a heart sinking was waiting for what she would say he sighed as after a danger escaped when she had uttered these words 
 anna suddenly turned to him 
 oh i have had a letter from moscow they write me that kitty very ill 
 really said vronsky knitting his brows 
 anna looked sternly at him 
 that interest you 
 on the contrary it does very much what is it exactly that they write you if may know he asked 
 anna got up and went to betsy 
 give me a cup of tea she said pausing behind her chair 
 while betsy was pouring out the tea vronsky walked up to anna 
 what is it they write you he repeated 
 i often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable though forever talking of it said anna without answering him wanted to tell you something for a long while she added and moving a few steps away she sat down at a corner table which held albums 
 i quite understand the significance of your words he said handing her the cup 
 she glanced towards the sofa beside her and he instantly sat down 
 yes wanted to tell you she said without looking at him your action was wrong wrong very wrong 
 do you suppose i know that acted wrongly but who was the cause of my doing so 
 why do you say that to me she said looking at him sternly 
 you know why he answered boldly and joyously meeting her glance and without dropping his eyes 
 it was not he but she who became confused 
 that merely proves you have no heart she said but her eyes said that she knew he had a heart and that was why she was afraid of him 
 what you spoke of just now was a mistake and not love 
 remember that i have forbidden you to utter that word that detestable word said anna with a shudder but at once she felt that by that very word forbidden she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love i have long meant to tell you this she went on looking resolutely into his eyes and all aflame from the burning flush on her cheeks come here purposely this evening knowing i should meet you i have come to tell you that this must end i have never blushed before anyone and you force me to feel guilty of something 
 he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face 
 what do you wish of me he said simply and gravely 
 i want you to go to moscow and ask for forgiveness she said 
 that is not your wish he said 
 he saw she was saying what she was forcing herself to say not what she wanted to say 
 if you love me as you say she whispered you will do this so that i may be at peace 
 his face grew radiant 
 you know that all my life to me but i know no peace and i give it to you all of myself and love yes i think of you and myself apart you and i are one to me and i see no possibility before us of peace either for me or for you i see a possibility of despair of wretchedness or else i see a possibility of happiness and what a happiness can it be impossible he added his lips barely moving yet she heard 
 she strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said but instead of that she let her eyes rest on him full of love and made no answer 
 come he thought in ecstasy when i was beginning to despair and it seemed there would be no end come she loves me she owns it 
 then do this for me never say such things to me and let us be friends she said in words but her eyes spoke quite differently 
 friends we shall never be that you know yourself whether we shall be the happiest or the most wretched of people that lies within your power 
 she would have said something but he interrupted her 
 for i ask but one thing i ask for the right to hope to suffer even as i am doing now but if even that cannot be command me to disappear and i disappear you shall not see me if my presence is painful to you 
 i want to drive you away 
 only change anything leave everything as it is said he in a shaky voice your husband 
 at that instant alexei alexandrovich did in fact walk into the room with his calm ungainly gait 
 glancing at his wife and vronsky he went up to the lady of the house and sitting down for a cup of tea began talking in his unhasty always audible voice in his habitual tone of banter as if he were teasing someone 
 your rambouillet is in full conclave he said looking round at all the party the graces and the muses 
 but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering as she called it using the english word and like a clever hostess she at once brought him around to a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription alexei alexandrovich was immediately carried away by the subject and began seriously defending the new imperial decree before princess betsy who had attacked it 
 vronsky and anna still sat at the little table 
 this is getting indecorous whispered one lady with an expressive glance at madame karenina her husband and vronsky 
 what did i tell you said friend 
 but it was not only these ladies who watched them almost everyone in the room even the princess miaghkaia and betsy herself looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle as though they found it a hindrance alexei alexandrovich was the only person who did not once look in their direction and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon 
 noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone princess betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to alexei alexandrovich and walked over to anna 
 always amazed at the clearness and precision of your language she said the most transcendent ideas seem to be within my grasp when speaking 
 oh yes said anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a word of what betsy had said she crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation 
 alexei alexandrovich after staying half an hour walked up to his wife and suggested that they go home together but she answered without looking at him that she was staying to supper alexei alexandrovich bowed himself out 
 the fat old tatar madame coachman in a glistening leather coat was with difficulty bridling the left of her pair of grays chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance a footman stood by the carriage door he had opened the hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand was unfastening the lace of her sleeve caught in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head was listening rapturously to the words vronsky murmured as he saw her down to her carriage 
 said nothing of course and i ask nothing he was saying but you know that friendship is not what i want that only one happiness in life for me that word you dislike so yes love 
 love she repeated slowly in an inner voice and suddenly at the very instant she unhooked the lace she added i like the word precisely because it means too much to me far more than you can understand and she glanced into his face 
 she gave him her hand and with her rapid springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage 
 her glance the touch of her hand had seared him he kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it and went home happy in the realization that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the two last months

 chapter 
 
 alexei alexandrovich had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with him about something but he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared as something striking and improper and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper he made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife 
 on reaching home alexei alexandrovich went to his study as he usually did seated himself in his low chair opened a book on the papacy at the place he had marked by inserting the paper knife read till one just as he usually did but from time to time he would rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna had not yet come in with a book under his arm he went upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her contrary to his usual habit he did not get into bed but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back he could not go to bed feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the situation that had just arisen 
 when alexei alexandrovich had made up his mind that he must have a talk with his wife it had seemed a very easy and simple matter but now when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself it seemed to him very complicated and difficult 
 alexei alexandrovich was not jealous jealousy according to his notions was an insult to wife and one ought to have confidence in wife why one ought to have that confidence that is to say a complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself but he had never experienced such a lack of confidence because he had confidence in her and told himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence had not broken down he still felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and fatuous and did not know what ought to be done alexei alexandrovich was standing face to face with life with the possibility of his loving someone other than himself and this seemed to him very fatuous and incomprehensible because it was of the very stuff of life all his life alexei alexandrovich had lived and worked in official spheres having to do merely with the reflections of life and every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken and that there is a chasm below that chasm was life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexei alexandrovich had lived for the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his loving someone else and he was horrified at it 
 he did not undress but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room where one lamp was burning over the carpet of the dark drawing room in which the light was reflected merely on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candles burned lighting up the portraits of her parents and feminine friends and the pretty knickknacks of her writing table every one of which he knew so well he walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turned back again 
 at each turn in his walk especially on the parquet of the dining room he halted and said to himself yes this i must decide and put a stop to i must express my view of it and my decision and he turned back again but just what shall i express and what decision he would say to himself in the drawing room and found no answer but after all he asked himself before turning into the boudoir what has occurred nothing she was talking a long while with him but what of that surely women in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy means debasing both her and myself he soliloquized as he entered her boudoir but this dictum which had always had such weight with him before had now no weight and no meaning whatsoever and from the bedroom door he turned back again but as he entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so and that if others had noticed it meant that there was something and he said to himself again in the dining room yes i must decide and put a stop to it and express my views and again at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself decide how and again he asked inwardly what has occurred and answered nothing and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawing room he was convinced that something had happened his thoughts like his body were describing a complete circle without alighting upon anything new he noticed this rubbed his forehead and sat down in her boudoir 
 there looking at her table with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter his thoughts suddenly changed he began to think of her of what her thoughts and emotions must be for the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life her ideas her desires and the thought that she could and must have a separate life of her own seemed to him so appalling that he made haste to drive it away it was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another place was a spiritual action foreign to alexei alexandrovich he looked on this spiritual action as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy 
 and the worst of it all thought he is that just now at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time when i stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies just now this stupid worry has to come falling about my ears but to be done not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them 
 i must think this over come to a decision and put it out of my mind he said aloud

 alexei alexandrovich had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with him about something but he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared as something striking and improper and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper he made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife 
 on reaching home alexei alexandrovich went to his study as he usually did seated himself in his low chair opened a book on the papacy at the place he had marked by inserting the paper knife read till one just as he usually did but from time to time he would rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna had not yet come in with a book under his arm he went upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her contrary to his usual habit he did not get into bed but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back he could not go to bed feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the situation that had just arisen 
 when alexei alexandrovich had made up his mind that he must have a talk with his wife it had seemed a very easy and simple matter but now when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself it seemed to him very complicated and difficult 
 alexei alexandrovich was not jealous jealousy according to his notions was an insult to wife and one ought to have confidence in wife why one ought to have that confidence that is to say a complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself but he had never experienced such a lack of confidence because he had confidence in her and told himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence had not broken down he still felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and fatuous and did not know what ought to be done alexei alexandrovich was standing face to face with life with the possibility of his loving someone other than himself and this seemed to him very fatuous and incomprehensible because it was of the very stuff of life all his life alexei alexandrovich had lived and worked in official spheres having to do merely with the reflections of life and every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken and that there is a chasm below that chasm was life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexei alexandrovich had lived for the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his loving someone else and he was horrified at it 
 he did not undress but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room where one lamp was burning over the carpet of the dark drawing room in which the light was reflected merely on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candles burned lighting up the portraits of her parents and feminine friends and the pretty knickknacks of her writing table every one of which he knew so well he walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turned back again 
 at each turn in his walk especially on the parquet of the dining room he halted and said to himself yes this i must decide and put a stop to i must express my view of it and my decision and he turned back again but just what shall i express and what decision he would say to himself in the drawing room and found no answer but after all he asked himself before turning into the boudoir what has occurred nothing she was talking a long while with him but what of that surely women in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy means debasing both her and myself he soliloquized as he entered her boudoir but this dictum which had always had such weight with him before had now no weight and no meaning whatsoever and from the bedroom door he turned back again but as he entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so and that if others had noticed it meant that there was something and he said to himself again in the dining room yes i must decide and put a stop to it and express my views and again at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself decide how and again he asked inwardly what has occurred and answered nothing and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawing room he was convinced that something had happened his thoughts like his body were describing a complete circle without alighting upon anything new he noticed this rubbed his forehead and sat down in her boudoir 
 there looking at her table with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter his thoughts suddenly changed he began to think of her of what her thoughts and emotions must be for the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life her ideas her desires and the thought that she could and must have a separate life of her own seemed to him so appalling that he made haste to drive it away it was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another place was a spiritual action foreign to alexei alexandrovich he looked on this spiritual action as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy 
 and the worst of it all thought he is that just now at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time when i stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies just now this stupid worry has to come falling about my ears but to be done not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them 
 i must think this over come to a decision and put it out of my mind he said aloud 
 the question of her feelings of what has passed and may be passing in her soul not my affair the affair of her conscience and falls under the head of religion he said to himself feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred 
 and so alexei alexandrovich said to himself questions as to her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience with which i can have nothing to do my duty is clearly defined as the head of the family i am a person bound in duty to guide her and consequently in part the person responsible i am bound to point out the danger i perceive to warn her even to use my authority i ought to speak plainly to her

 anna came in with her head bent playing with the tassels of her hood her face was glowing with a vivid glow but this glow was not one of joyousness it recalled the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on seeing her husband anna raised her head and smiled as though she had just waked up 
 not in bed what a miracle she said throwing off her hood and without stopping she went on into the dressing room late alexei alexandrovich she said from behind the door 
 anna i must have a talk with you 
 with me she said wonderingly she came out from the door and looked at him why what is it what about she asked sitting down well talk if so necessary but it would be better to go to sleep 
 anna was saying whatever came to her tongue and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy she felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her 
 anna i must warn you he began 
 warn me she said of what 
 she looked at him so simply so brightly that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him it meant a great deal to see now that she did not care to notice his state of mind that she did not care to say a word about herself he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were now closed against him more than that he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that but seemed to be saying straightforwardly to him yes it is closed now which is as it should be and will be so in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have who returning home finds his own house locked up but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexei alexandrovich 
 i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with quiet intervals attracted attention 
 he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look and as he talked he felt all the uselessness and futility of his words 
 always like that she answered as though completely misapprehending him and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase one time you like my being dull and another time you like my being lively i dull does that offend you 
 alexei alexandrovich shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack 
 oh please do that i dislike it so she said 
 anna is this you said alexei alexandrovich quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his hands 
 but what is it all about she said with such genuine and droll wonder what do you want of me 
 alexei alexandrovich paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against some imaginary barrier 
 this is what i meant to say to you he went on coldly and composedly and i beg you to hear me to the end i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be guided by it but there are certain rules of decency which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i who observed it but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what one would desire 
 i positively understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he care she thought but other people noticed it and what upsets him not well alexei alexandrovich she added and getting up was about to pass through the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her 
 his face was gloomy and forbidding as anna had never seen it before she stopped and bending her head back and to one side began taking out her hairpins with her hand 
 well listening what does follow she said calmly and ironically and indeed i am listening even with interest for i should like to understand what it is all about 
 she spoke and marveled at the confident calm and natural tone in which she spoke and at the choice of the words she used 
 to enter into all the details of your feelings i have no right and besides i regard that as useless and even harmful began alexei alexandrovich rummaging in our souls we often bring up something that might have otherwise lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience but i am in duty bound to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement 
 i understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins 
 anna for sake speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken but believe me that which i am saying i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you 
 for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the phrase i love threw her into revolt again she thought love can he love if he heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he even know what love is 
 alexei alexandrovich i really do not understand she said define what it is you consider 
 pardon let me say all i have to say i love you but i am not speaking of myself the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself it may very well be i repeat that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them then i beg you to think a little and if your heart prompts you to speak out to me 
 alexei alexandrovich was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared 
 i have nothing to say and besides she said suddenly with difficulty repressing a smile really time to be in bed 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and without saying more went into the bedroom 
 when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and forgot about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexei alexandrovich seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after a pause of one or two breaths the snore sounded again with a new tranquil rhythm 
 late late she whispered with a smile a long while she lay without moving and with open eyes whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness

 that which to vronsky had been for almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life replacing all his old desires that which to anna had been an impossible terrible and for that very reason a more entrancing dream of happiness that desire had been fulfilled he stood before her pale his lower jaw quivering and besought her to be calm without himself knowing how or why 
 anna anna he said with a quivering voice anna for sake 
 but the louder he spoke the lower she cast down her once proud and gay but now head and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting down on the floor at his feet she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her 
 my god forgive me she said sobbing pressing his hands to her bosom 
 she felt so sinful so guilty that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness and as now there was no one in her life but him to him too she addressed her prayer for forgiveness looking at him she had a physical sense of her humiliation and she could say nothing more and he felt as a murderer must feel when he beholds the body he has robbed of life that body robbed by him of life was their love the first stage of their love there was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame shame at her spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him but in spite of all the horror before the body of his victim he must hack it to pieces hide the body must use what the murderer had gained by his murder 
 and as the murderer with fury and as it were with passion falls on the body and drags it and hacks at it so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses she held his hand and did not stir yes these kisses that is what has been bought by this shame yes and this one hand which will always be mine the hand of my accomplice she lifted up that hand and kissed it he sank on his knees and tried to see her face but she hid it and said nothing at last as though making an effort over herself she got up and pushed him away her face was still as beautiful but it was only the more pitiful for that 
 all is over she said i have nothing but you remember that 
 i can never forget what is my whole life for one instant of this happiness 
 happiness she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him for sake not a word not a word more 
 she rose quickly and moved away from him 
 not a word more she repeated and with a look of chill despair incomprehensible to him she parted from him she felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame of rapture and of horror at this stepping into a new life and she did not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words but later too and the next day and the day after she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of those feelings indeed she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul 
 she said to herself no just now i think of it later on when i am calmer but this calm for thoughts never came every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her and what she ought to do a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away 
 later later she said when i am calmer 
 but in her dreams when she had no control over her thoughts her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunted her almost every night she dreamed that both were husbands at once that both were lavishing caresses on her alexei alexandrovich was weeping kissing her hands and saying how happy we are now and alexei vronsky was there too and he too was her husband and she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her was explaining to them laughing that this was ever so much simpler and that now both of them were happy and contented but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare and she would awake from it in terror

 in the early days after his return from moscow whenever levin shuddered and grew red remembering the disgrace of his rejection he would say to himself this was just how i used to shudder and blush thinking everything utterly lost when i was flunked in physics and did not get promoted and this is also how i thought myself utterly ruined after i had mismanaged that affair of my with which i had been entrusted and yet now that the years have passed i recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much it will be the same thing with this trouble as well time will go by and i shall not mind this either 
 but three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it and it was as painful for him to think of it now as it had been during those first days he could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life and feeling himself so ripe for it he was still not married and was farther than ever from marriage he was painfully conscious himself as were all about him that at his years it is not good that man should be alone he remembered how before starting for moscow he had once said to his cowherd nicolai a simplehearted peasant to whom he liked to talk well nicolai i mean to get married and how nicolai had promptly answered as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt and high time too konstantin dmitrich but marriage had now become farther off than ever the place was taken and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place he felt that it was utterly impossible moreover the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame however often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it that recollection like other similarly humiliating recollections made him wince and blush there had been in his past as in every actions recognized by him as bad for which his conscience ought to have tormented him but the recollection of these evil actions was far from causing him as much suffering as these trivial but humiliating recollections these wounds never healed and with these recollections was now ranged his rejection and the sorry plight in which he must have appeared to others that evening yet time and labor were doing their work bitter recollections were more and more being covered up by the incidents inconspicuous ones but important of his country life every week he thought less often of kitty he was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married or just going to be married hoping that such news would like having a tooth out completely cure him 
 meanwhile spring came on beautiful and kindly without the delays and treacheries incident to spring one of those rare springs in which plants beasts and man rejoice alike this lovely spring roused levin still more and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out his most important resolution that of purity of life had nevertheless been kept by him he was free from that shame which had usually harassed him after a fall and he could look everyone straight in the face in february he had received a letter from marya nikolaevna telling him that his brother health was getting worse but that he would not take advice and in consequence of this letter levin went to moscow to his and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a watering place abroad he succeeded so well in persuading his brother and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him that he was satisfied with himself on that score in addition to his farming which called for special attention in spring in addition to reading levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question like the climate and the soil and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture not simply from the data of soil and climate but from the data of soil climate and a certain unalterable character of the laborer thus in spite of his solitude or in consequence of his solitude life was exceedingly full save that on rare occasions he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides agathya mikhailovna with her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussions upon physics the theory of agriculture and especially philosophy philosophy was agathya favorite subject

 chapter 
 
 levin put on his big boots and for the first time a cloth overcoat instead of his fur cloak and went out to look after his farm stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes and stepping one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud 
 spring is the time of plans and projects and as he came out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects first of all he went to the cattle the cows had been let out into their paddock and their smooth sides were already glossy with their new sleek spring coats they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow and the calves to be let into the paddock the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girls picking up their petticoats ran splashing through the mud with bare legs still white not yet brown from the sun waving brushwood in their hands chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring 
 after admiring the increase of that year which were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a cow and daughter at three months old was as big as a yearling levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks but it appeared that since the paddock had not been used during the winter the racks made in the autumn were broken he sent for the carpenter who according to his orders ought to have been at work at the threshing machine but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows which ought to have been repaired before lent this was very annoying to levin it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years the racks as he ascertained being not wanted in winter had been carried to the cart horses stable and there broken as they were of light construction only meant for foddering calves moreover it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters had not been put into repair and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field levin sent for his bailiff but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff beaming all over like everything that day in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan came out of the barn twisting a bit of straw in his hands 
 why the carpenter at the threshing machine 
 oh i meant to tell you yesterday the harrows want repairing here time they got to work in the fields 
 but what were they doing in the winter then 
 but what did you want the carpenter for 
 where are the racks for the calves paddock 
 i ordered them to be got ready what would you have with those people said the bailiff with a wave of his hand 
 not those people but this bailiff said levin getting angry why what do i keep you for he cried but bethinking himself that this would not help matters he stopped short in the middle of a sentence and merely sighed well what do you say can sowing begin he asked after a pause 
 behind turkino tomorrow or next day they might begin 
 and the clover 
 sent vassilii and mishka sowing it only i know if manage to get through so slushy 
 how many dessiatinas 
 six 
 why not sow all cried levin 
 that they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas not in all the twenty was still more annoying to him clover as he knew both from books and from his own experience never did well except when it was sown as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this done 
 no one to send what would you do with such people three turned up and semion 
 well you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter 
 and so i have as it is 
 where are the peasants then 
 five are making compote which meant compost and four are shifting the oats for fear of being touched konstantin dmitrich 
 levin knew very well that touching meant that his english seed oats were already spoiled again they had not done as he had ordered 
 why but i told you during lent to put in pipes he cried 
 be put out we shall get it all done in time 
 levin made an angry gesture and went into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats were not yet spoiled but the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary and arranging for this to be done and taking two laborers from there for sowing clover levin got over the vexation his bailiff had caused him indeed it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry 
 ignat he called to the coachman who with his sleeves tucked up was washing the carriage wheels saddle 
 which sir 
 well let it be kolpik 
 yes sir 
 while they were saddling his horse levin again called the bailiff who was hanging about in sight to make it up with him and began talking to him about the spring operations before them and his plans for the farming 
 the wagons were to begin carting manure earlier so as to get all done before the early mowing and the plowing of the outlying land was to go on without a break so as to let it lie black fallow and furrowed and the moving to be all done by hired labor not on 
 the bailiff listened attentively and obviously made an effort to approve of his projects but still he had that look levin knew so well that always irritated him a look of hopelessness and despondency that look said all very well but as god wills 
 nothing mortified levin so much as that tone but it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had they had all taken that attitude to his plans and so now he was not angered by it but mortified and felt all the more roused to struggle against this apparently elemental force continually ranged against him for which he could find no other name than as god wills 
 if we can manage it konstantin dmitrich said the bailiff 
 why you manage it 
 we positively must have fifteen laborers more and they turn up there were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer 
 levin was silent again he was brought face to face with that opposing force he knew that however much they tried they could not hire more than forty perhaps or laborers for a reasonable sum some forty had been taken on and there were no more but still he could not help struggling against it 
 send to sury to chefirovka if they come we must look for them 
 send to be sure said vassilii fiodorovich despondently but then there are the horses not good for much 
 get some more i know of course levin added laughing you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as possible but this year not going to let you have things your own way see to everything myself 
 why i think you take much rest as it is it cheers us up to work under the eye 
 so sowing clover behind the birch dale go and have a look at them he said mounting the little bay cob kolpik who was led up by the coachman 
 you get across the stream konstantin dmitrich the coachman shouted 
 all right go by the forest 
 and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity ambling easily snorting over the pools and asking as it were for guidance 
 if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open country swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he rode through his forest over the crumbling wasted snow still left in parts and covered with dissolving tracks he rejoiced over every tree with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots when he came out of the forest in the immense plain before him his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horse and colt trampling down his young grass he told a peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he met on the way and asked well ipat shall we soon be sowing we must get the plowing done first konstantin dmitrich answered ipat the farther he rode the happier he became and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders so that the snow should not lie under them to divide them up into six fields of tillage and three for pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land and then three hundred dessiatinas of wheat one hundred of potatoes and one hundred and fifty of clover and not a dessiatina exhausted 
 absorbed in such dreams carefully keeping his horse by the hedges so as not to trample his young winter fields he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover a telega with the seed in it was standing not at the edge but in the middle of the tillage and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse both the laborers were sitting in the hedge probably smoking a pipe turn and turn about the earth in the telega with which the seed was mixed was not crushed to powder but crusted together or adhering in clods seeing the master the laborer vassilii went toward the telega while mishka set to work sowing this was not as it should be but with the laborers levin seldom lost his temper when vassilii came up levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge 
 never mind sir spring up again responded vassilii 
 please argue said levin but do as told 
 yes sir answered vassilii and he took the head what a sowing konstantin dmitrich he said ingratiatingly only a work to get about a fellow drags thirty pounds of earth at every step 
 why is it you have earth not sifted said levin 
 well we crumble it up answered vassilii taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms 
 vassilii was not to blame for their having fired up his telega with unsifted earth but still it was annoying 
 levin had already more than once tried a way he knew for stifling his anger and turning all that seemed dark right again and he tried that way now he watched how mishka strode along swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot and getting off his horse he took the sieve from vassilii and started sowing himself 
 where did you stop 
 vassilii pointed to the mark with his foot and levin went forward as best he could scattering the seed on the land walking was as difficult as on a bog and by the time levin had ended the row he was in a great heat and stopping gave the sieve over to vassilii 
 well master when here mind you scold me for this row said vassilii 
 eh said levin cheerily already feeling the effect of his method 
 why see in the summertime look different look you where i sowed last spring how i did work at it i do my best konstantin dmitrich see as i would for my own father i like botchwork myself nor would i let another man do it good for the master is good for us too it does heart good said vassilii pointing to look over yonder 
 a lovely spring vassilii 
 why a spring such as even the old men remember the like of i was up home my father there has sown wheat too three osminas of it he was saying you tell it from rye 
 have you been sowing wheat long 
 why sir it was you taught us the year before last you gave me two measures we sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas 
 well mind you crumble up the clods said levin going toward his horse and keep an eye on mishka and if a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every dessiatina 
 thank you kindly we are very well content sir with your treatment as it is 
 levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last clover was and the one which was plowed ready for the spring corn 
 the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent it had revived already and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last wheat the horse sank in up to the pasterns and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the ground over the plowland the riding was utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice and in the thawing furrows he sank in deep at each step the plowland was in splendid condition in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing everything was capital everything was cheering levin rode back across the streams hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across and startled two ducks there must be woodcock here too he thought and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper who confirmed his theory about the woodcock 
 levin went home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening

 why a spring such as even the old men remember the like of i was up home my father there has sown wheat too three osminas of it he was saying you tell it from rye 
 have you been sowing wheat long 
 why sir it was you taught us the year before last you gave me two measures we sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas 
 well mind you crumble up the clods said levin going toward his horse and keep an eye on mishka and if a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every dessiatina 
 thank you kindly we are very well content sir with your treatment as it is 
 levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last clover was and the one which was plowed ready for the spring corn 
 the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent it had revived already and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last wheat the horse sank in up to the pasterns and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the ground over the plowland the riding was utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice and in the thawing furrows he sank in deep at each step the plowland was in splendid condition in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing everything was capital everything was cheering levin rode back across the streams hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across and startled two ducks there must be woodcock here too he thought and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper who confirmed his theory about the woodcock 
 levin went home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening

 as he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house 
 yes someone from the railway station he thought just the time to be here from the moscow train who could it be what if brother nikolai he did say i may go to the waters or i may come down to you he felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute that his brother presence should come to his happy mood of spring but he felt ashamed of the feeling and at once he opened as it were the arms of his soul and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation he now hoped with all his heart that it was his brother he spurred on his horse and as he rode out from behind the acacias he saw a hired troika from the railway station and a gentleman in a fur coat it was not his brother oh if it were only some pleasant person one could talk to a little he thought 
 ah cried levin joyfully flinging up both his hands a delightful visitor ah how glad i am to see you he shouted recognizing stepan arkadyevich 
 i shall find out for certain whether married or when going to be married he thought 
 and on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all 
 expect me did you said stepan arkadyevich getting out of the sleigh splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose on his cheek and on his eyebrows but radiant with health and good spirits come primarily to see you he said embracing and kissing him secondly to have some stand shooting and thirdly to sell the forest at ergushovo 
 delightful what a spring having how ever did you get along in a sleigh 
 in a wagon it would have been worse still konstantin dmitrievich answered the driver who knew him 
 well very very glad to see you said levin with a genuine smile of childlike delight 
 levin led his friend to the guest room where stepan things were also carried a bag a gun in a case a satchel for cigars leaving him there to wash and change his clothes levin went off to the countinghouse to speak about the plowing and the clover agathya mikhailovna always very anxious for the credit of the house met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner 
 do just as you like only let it be as soon as possible he said and went to the bailiff 
 when he came back stepan arkadyevich washed and combed came out of his room with a beaming smile and they went upstairs together 
 well i am glad i managed to get away to you now i shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here no really i envy you what a house how splendid it all is so bright so cheerful said stepan arkadyevich forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather as on this day and your old nurse is simply charming a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable perhaps but for your severe monastic style it does very well 
 stepan arkadyevich imparted to him many interesting bits of news especially interesting to levin was the news that his brother sergei ivanovich was intending to spend the summer with him in the country 
 not one word did stepan arkadyevich say in reference to kitty and the shcherbatskys he merely gave him greetings from his wife levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and rejoiced exceedingly over his guest as always happened with him during his solitude a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him which he could not communicate to those about him and now he poured out upon stepan arkadyevich his poetic joy over the spring and his failures and plans for the land and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading and the idea of his own book the basis of which really was though he was unaware of it himself a criticism of all the old books on agriculture stepan arkadyevich always charming understanding everything at the slightest reference was particularly charming on this visit and levin noticed in him a special tenderness as it were and a new tone of respect that flattered him 
 the efforts of agathya mikhailovna and the cook to have the dinner particularly good only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course eating a great deal of bread and butter salt goose and salted mushrooms and in finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little patties with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevich was accustomed to very different dinners he thought everything excellent the herb brandy and the bread and the butter and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms and the nettle soup and the chicken in white sauce and the white crimean wine everything was excellent and marvelous 
 splendid splendid he said lighting a fat cigar after the roast i feel as if coming to you i had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer and so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture of course an ignorant outsider but i should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too 
 yes but wait a bit not talking of political economy talking of the science of agriculture it ought to be like the natural sciences and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic ethnographical 
 at that instant agathya mikhailovna came in with jam 
 oh agathya fiodorovna said stepan arkadyevich kissing the tips of his plump fingers what salt goose what herb brandy what do you think it time to start kostia he added 
 levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare treetops of the forest 
 yes time he said kouzma get ready the wide droshky and he ran downstairs 
 stepan arkadyevich going down carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands and opening it began to get ready his expensive gun kouzma who already scented a big tip never left stepan side and put on him both his stockings and boots a task which stepan arkadyevich readily left to him 
 kostia give orders that if the merchant riabinin comes i told him to come today to be shown in and asked to wait for me 
 why do you mean to say selling the forest to riabinin 
 yes do you know him 
 to be sure i do i have had to do business with him positively and definitively 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed positively and definitively were the favorite words 
 yes wonderfully funny the way he talks she knows where her going he added patting laska who hung about levin whining and licking his hands his boots and his gun 
 the droshky was already at the steps when they went out 
 i told them to bring the droshky round though not far to go or would you rather walk 
 no better drive said stepan arkadyevich getting into the droshky he sat down tucked the rug round him and lighted a cigar how is it you smoke a cigar is a sort of thing not exactly a pleasure but the crown and outward sign of pleasure come this is life how splendid it is this is how i should like to live 
 why who prevents you said levin smiling 
 no a lucky man got everything you like you like horses and you have them dogs you have them shooting you have it farming you have it 
 perhaps because i rejoice in what i have and fret for what i said levin thinking of kitty 
 stepan arkadyevich comprehended looked at him but said nothing 
 levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing with his tact that he dreaded conversation about the shcherbatskys and so saying nothing about them but now levin was longing to find out about that which was tormenting him so yet had not the courage to begin 
 come tell me how things are going with you said levin bethinking himself that it was not good of him to think only of himself 
 stepan eyes sparkled merrily 
 you admit i know that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had ration of bread to your mind a crime but i count life as life without love he said taking question in his own way what am i to do made that way and really one does so little harm to anyone and gives oneself so much pleasure 
 what is there something new then queried levin 
 yes my boy there is there do you see you know the type of women women such as one sees in dreams well these women are sometimes to be met with in reality and these women are terrible woman you know is such a subject that no matter how much you study it always perfectly new 
 well then it would be better not to study it 
 no some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth not in the finding of it 
 levin listened in silence and in spite of all the efforts he made he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women

 the place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reaching the copse levin got out of the droshky and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch he took off his full overcoat fastened his belt again and worked his arms to see if they were free 
 gray old laska who had followed them sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears the sun was setting behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch trees dotted about in the aspen copse stood out clearly with their hanging twigs and their buds swollen almost to bursting 
 from the thickest parts of the copse where the snow still remained came the faint sound of narrow winding streamlets of water running away tiny birds twittered and now and then fluttered from tree to tree 
 in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last leaves stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of grasses 
 imagine one can hear and see the grass growing levin said to himself noticing a wet aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood listened and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listening all alert sometimes at the sea of bare treetops that stretched on the slope below him sometimes at the darkening sky covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with a slow sweep of its wings another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hooted not far off and laska starting stepped cautiously a few steps forward and putting her head on one side began to listen intently beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo twice she uttered her usual call and then became hoarse hurried and broke down 
 imagine the cuckoo already said stepan arkadyevich coming out from behind a bush 
 yes i hear it answered levin reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice which sounded disagreeable to himself now coming 
 stepan figure again went behind the bush and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette 
 tchk tchk came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevich cocking his gun 
 that cry asked oblonsky drawing attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice in play 
 oh you know it a buck hare but enough talking listen here it comes almost shrieked levin cocking his gun 
 they heard a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well known to the sportsman two seconds later another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be heard 
 levin looked about him to right and to left and there just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens he saw the flying bird it was flying straight toward him the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sounded close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen and at the very instant when levin was taking aim behind the bush where oblonsky stood there was a flash of red lightning the bird dropped like an arrow and darted upward again again came the red flash and the sound of a blow and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air the bird paused stopped still an instant and fell with a heavy splash to the slushy ground 
 can i possibly have missed it shouted stepan arkadyevich who could not see for the smoke 
 here it is said levin pointing to laska who with one ear pricked up wagging the tip of her shaggy tail was coming slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and seemingly smiling was bringing the dead bird to her master well glad you were successful said levin who at the same time had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the woodcock 
 it was a bad shot from the right barrel responded stepan arkadyevich loading his gun sh here it comes 
 the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again two woodcocks playing and chasing one another and only whistling not crying flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen there was the report of four shots and like swallows the woodcocks turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight 
 the stand shooting was capital stepan arkadyevich shot two more birds and levin two of which one was not found it began to get dark venus bright and silvery shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees and high up in the east twinkled the red fires of somber arcturus over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again the woodcocks had ceased flying but levin resolved to stay a little longer till venus which he saw below a branch of birch should be above it and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus had risen above the branch and the chariot of the great bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he waited 
 it time to go home said stepan arkadyevich 
 it was quite still now in the copse and not a bird was stirring 
 stay a little while answered levin 
 as you like 
 they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another 
 stiva said levin unexpectedly how is it you tell me whether your married yet or when going to be 
 levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied could affect him but he had never dreamed of the answer which stepan arkadyevich made 
 never thought of being married and thinking of it but very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad positively afraid she may not live 
 what cried levin very ill what is wrong with her how is she 
 while they were speaking laska with ears pricked up was looking upward at the sky and reproachfully at them 
 what a time they have chosen to gab she was thinking there it comes here it is yes sure enough miss it thought laska 
 but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which as it were smote on their ears and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed and two bangs sounded at the very same instant the woodcock flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket bending down the delicate shoots 
 splendid together cried levin and he ran with laska into the thicket to look for the woodcock 
 oh yes what was it that was unpleasant he recollected yes ill well it be helped very sorry he thought 
 found it she a clever girl he said taking the warm bird from mouth and packing it into the almost full gamebag got it stiva he shouted

 here it is said levin pointing to laska who with one ear pricked up wagging the tip of her shaggy tail was coming slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and seemingly smiling was bringing the dead bird to her master well glad you were successful said levin who at the same time had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the woodcock 
 it was a bad shot from the right barrel responded stepan arkadyevich loading his gun sh here it comes 
 the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again two woodcocks playing and chasing one another and only whistling not crying flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen there was the report of four shots and like swallows the woodcocks turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight 
 the stand shooting was capital stepan arkadyevich shot two more birds and levin two of which one was not found it began to get dark venus bright and silvery shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees and high up in the east twinkled the red fires of somber arcturus over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again the woodcocks had ceased flying but levin resolved to stay a little longer till venus which he saw below a branch of birch should be above it and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus had risen above the branch and the chariot of the great bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he waited 
 it time to go home said stepan arkadyevich 
 it was quite still now in the copse and not a bird was stirring 
 stay a little while answered levin 
 as you like 
 they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another 
 stiva said levin unexpectedly how is it you tell me whether your married yet or when going to be 
 levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied could affect him but he had never dreamed of the answer which stepan arkadyevich made 
 never thought of being married and thinking of it but very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad positively afraid she may not live 
 what cried levin very ill what is wrong with her how is she 
 while they were speaking laska with ears pricked up was looking upward at the sky and reproachfully at them 
 what a time they have chosen to gab she was thinking there it comes here it is yes sure enough miss it thought laska 
 but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which as it were smote on their ears and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed and two bangs sounded at the very same instant the woodcock flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket bending down the delicate shoots 
 splendid together cried levin and he ran with laska into the thicket to look for the woodcock 
 oh yes what was it that was unpleasant he recollected yes ill well it be helped very sorry he thought 
 found it she a clever girl he said taking the warm bird from mouth and packing it into the almost full gamebag got it stiva he shouted 
 chapter 
 the place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reaching the copse levin got out of the droshky and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch he took off his full overcoat fastened his belt again and worked his arms to see if they were free 
 gray old laska who had followed them sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears the sun was setting behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch trees dotted about in the aspen copse stood out clearly with their hanging twigs and their buds swollen almost to bursting 
 from the thickest parts of the copse where the snow still remained came the faint sound of narrow winding streamlets of water running away tiny birds twittered and now and then fluttered from tree to tree 
 in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last leaves stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of grasses 
 imagine one can hear and see the grass growing levin said to himself noticing a wet aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood listened and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listening all alert sometimes at the sea of bare treetops that stretched on the slope below him sometimes at the darkening sky covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with a slow sweep of its wings another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hooted not far off and laska starting stepped cautiously a few steps forward and putting her head on one side began to listen intently beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo twice she uttered her usual call and then became hoarse hurried and broke down 
 imagine the cuckoo already said stepan arkadyevich coming out from behind a bush 
 yes i hear it answered levin reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice which sounded disagreeable to himself now coming 
 stepan figure again went behind the bush and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette 
 tchk tchk came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevich cocking his gun 
 that cry asked oblonsky drawing attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice in play 
 oh you know it a buck hare but enough talking listen here it comes almost shrieked levin cocking his gun 
 they heard a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well known to the sportsman two seconds later another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be heard 
 levin looked about him to right and to left and there just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens he saw the flying bird it was flying straight toward him the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sounded close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen and at the very instant when levin was taking aim behind the bush where oblonsky stood there was a flash of red lightning the bird dropped like an arrow and darted upward again again came the red flash and the sound of a blow and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air the bird paused stopped still an instant and fell with a heavy splash to the slushy ground

 on the way home levin asked all the details of illness and of the shcherbatskys plans and though he would have been ashamed to admit it he was pleased at what he heard he was pleased that there was still hope and still more pleased that she who had made him suffer should be suffering so much but when stepan arkadyevich began to speak of the causes of illness and mentioned name levin cut him short 
 i have no right whatever to know family matters and to tell the truth no interest in them either 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a barely perceptible smile catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in face which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before 
 have you quite settled about the forest with riabinin asked levin 
 yes all settled the price is magnificent thousand eight straightaway and the rest in six years been bothering about it for ever so long no one would give more 
 then as good as given away your forest for nothing said levin gloomily 
 how do you mean for nothing said stepan arkadyevich with a smile knowing that nothing would be right in eyes now 
 because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles the dessiatina answered levin 
 oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevich playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we are better at it than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that afraid of this crying off in fact you know not timber forest said stepan arkadyevich hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts but for the most part firewood and it run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina and paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina 
 levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina he says those words without understanding them himself 
 i attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but so positive you know all the lore of the forest difficult have you counted the trees 
 how count the trees said stepan arkadyevich laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper count sands of seas and rays of stars though could some higher power 
 oh well the higher power of riabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your worth five hundred a dessiatina paid down while giving you two hundred by installments so that in fact making him a present of thirty thousand 
 come let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevich piteously why was it none would give it then 
 why because he has an understanding with the merchants bought them off had to do with all of them i know them not merchants you know speculators he look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a worth for twenty kopecks 
 well enough of it out of temper 
 not in the least said levin gloomily as they drove up to the house 
 at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps in the trap sat the chubby tightly belted overseer who served riabinin as coachman riabinin himself was already in the house and met the friends in the hall riabinin was a tall thinnish man with mustache and a projecting chin and prominent eyes he was dressed in a blue coat with buttons below the waist at the back and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf with big galoshes drawn over them he mopped his face with his handkerchief and wrapping himself in his coat which sat extremely well as it was he greeted them with a smile holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevich as though he wanted to catch something 
 so here you are said stepan arkadyevich giving him his hand capital 
 i did not venture to disregard your commands though the road was extremely bad i positively covered the whole way at a walk but i am here on time konstantin dmitrich my respects he turned to levin trying to seize his hand too but levin scowling made as though he did not notice his hand and took out the woodcocks your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray added riabinin looking contemptuously at the woodcocks a great delicacy i suppose and he shook his head disapprovingly as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle 
 would you like to go into my study levin said in french to stepan arkadyevich scowling morosely go into my study you can talk there 
 quite so wherever you please said riabinin with supercilious dignity as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything 
 on entering the study riabinin looked about as it was a habit of his as though seeking a holy image but when he had found it he did not cross himself he scanned the bookcases and bookshelves and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the woodcocks he smiled superciliously and shook his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game either were worth the candle 
 well have you brought the money asked oblonsky sit down 
 oh trouble about the money come to see you to talk it over 
 what is there to talk over but do sit down 
 i mind if i do said riabinin sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his armchair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself you must knock it down a bit prince it would be a sin otherwise as for the money it is ready definitively to the last kopeck as for money down be no hitch there 
 levin who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard was just going out of the door but catching the words he stopped 
 why got the forest for nothing as it is he said he came to me too late or have fixed the price for him 
 riabinin got up and in silence with a smile he looked up at levin 
 konstantin dmitrievich is very close he said with a smile turning to stepan arkadyevich definitively no dealing with him i was bargaining for some wheat of him and a pretty price i offered too 
 why should i give you mine for nothing i pick it up off the ground nor did i steal it either 
 mercy on us nowadays positively no chance at all of stealing with the definitively open courts and everything done in style nowadays no question of stealing we are just talking things over like gentlemen his asking too much for the forest i make both ends meet over it i must ask for a little concession 
 but is the thing settled between you or it if settled useless haggling but if it said levin buy the forest 
 the smile vanished at once from face a hawklike greedy cruel expression was left upon it with rapid bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat revealing a large shirt bronze waistcoat buttons and a watch chain and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook 
 here you are the forest is mine he said crossing himself quickly and holding out his hand take the money my forest way of doing business he haggle over every copper he added scowling and waving the pocketbook 
 i be in a hurry if i were you said levin 
 come really said oblonsky in surprise given my word you know 
 levin went out of the room slamming the door riabinin looked toward the door and shook his head with a smile 
 all youthfulness definitively nothing but childishness why buying it upon my honor simply believe me for the glory of it that riabinin and no one else should have bought the copse of oblonsky and as to the profits why i must make what god gives my witness if you would kindly sign the title deed 
 within an hour the merchant carefully stroking his wrapper down and hooking up his coat with the agreement in his pocket seated himself in his tightly covered trap and drove homeward 
 ugh these gentlefolk he said to the overseer they are all made alike a fine lot 
 so responded the overseer handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron but can i congratulate you on the purchase mikhail ignatich

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance the business of the forest was over the money in his pocket their shooting had been excellent and stepan arkadyevich was in the happiest frame of mind and therefore felt especially anxious to dissipate the that had come upon levin he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun 
 levin certainly was out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming guest he could not control his mood the aftereffects of the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him 
 kitty was not married and was ill and ill from love for a man who had slighted her this offense as it were rebounded upon him vronsky had slighted her and she had slighted him levin consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin and therefore he was his enemy but all this levin did not think of he vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him but he fell foul of everything that presented itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practised upon oblonsky and concluded in his house exasperated him 
 well finished he said meeting stepan arkadyevich upstairs would you like supper 
 well i say no to it what an appetite i get in the country wonderful why you offer riabinin something 
 oh damn him 
 still how you do treat him said oblonsky you even shake hands with him why not shake hands with him 
 because i shake hands with a waiter and a a hundred times better than he is 
 what a reactionist you are really what about the amalgamation of classes said oblonsky 
 anyone who likes it is welcome to it but it sickens me 
 a downright reactionist i see 
 really i have never considered what i am i am konstantin levin and nothing else 
 and konstantin levin very much out of temper said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes i am out of temper and do you know why because excuse me of your stupid sale 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own 
 come enough about that he said when did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale it was worth much more but when one wants to sell no one will give anything no i see a grudge against that unlucky riabinin 
 maybe i have and do you know why say again that a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which i belong and in spite of the amalgamation of classes glad to belong and their impoverishment is not due to living in luxury that would be nothing living in good style the proper thing for noblemen only the nobles who know how to do it now the peasants about us buy land and i mind that the gentleman does nothing while the peasant works and supplants the idle man as it should be and i welcome the peasant but i do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of i know what to call it innocence here a polish lessee bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a lady who lives in nice and there a merchant leases land worth ten roubles in rent the dessiatina for one rouble here for no kind of reason made that cheat a present of thirty thousand roubles 
 well what should i have done counted every tree 
 of course they must be counted you count them but riabinin did children will have means of livelihood and education while yours like as not 
 well you must excuse me but something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the done and an end of it and here come some fried eggs my favorite dish and agathya mikhailovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy 
 stepan arkadyevich sat down at the table and began jollying agathya mikhailovna assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper 
 well you praise it at any rate said agathya mikhailovna but konstantin dmitrievich no matter what you give him even a crust of bread will just eat it and walk away 
 though levin tried to control himself he was gloomy and silent he wanted to put one question to stepan arkadyevich but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevich had gone down to his room undressed again washed and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills had got into bed but levin still lingered in his room talking of various trifling matters and not daring to ask what he wanted to know 
 how wonderfully they make the soap he said gazing at a piece of soap he was unwrapping which agathya mikhailovna had placed in readiness for the guest but a brand which oblonsky did not use just look why a work of art 
 yes brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays said stepan arkadyevich with a moist and blissful yawn the theater for instance and the entertainments he yawned the electric light everywhere 
 yes the electric light said levin yes oh and vronsky now he asked suddenly laying down the soap 
 vronsky said stepan arkadyevich checking his yawn in peterburg he left soon after you did and been once in moscow since and do you know kostia tell you the truth he went on leaning his elbow on the table and with his hand propping up his handsome ruddy face in which his humid sleepy eyes shone like stars your own fault you took fright at the sight of your rival but as i told you at the time i say which had the better chance why you fight it out i told you at the time that he yawned inwardly without opening his mouth 
 does he know or he that i did propose levin wondered gazing at him yes something humbugging something diplomatic in his face and feeling he was blushing he looked stepan arkadyevich straight in the face without speaking 
 if there was anything on her side at that time it was nothing but a superficial attraction pursued oblonsky his being such a perfect aristocrat you know and his future position in society had an influence not with her but with her mother 
 levin scowled the humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received but he was at home and the walls of home are a support 
 wait wait he began interrupting oblonsky you talk of his being an aristocrat but allow me to ask what it consists of that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which i can be looked down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but i a man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother god knows whom she mixed up with no excuse me but i consider myself aristocratic and people like me who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family of the highest degree of breeding talent and intellect of course are another matter and have never curried favor with anyone never depended on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and i know many such you think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest while you make riabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get from the government your liferent and i know what while i shall not and so i prize come to me from my ancestors or has been won by hard work we are aristocrats and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful ones of this earth and who can be bought for twenty kopecks 
 well but whom are you attacking i agree with you said stepan arkadyevich sincerely and genially though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twenty kopecks levin was reckoning him as well animation gave him genuine pleasure whom are you attacking a good deal of what you say is not true about vronsky of course but i talk about that i tell you straight out if i were you i should go back with me to moscow and 
 no i know whether you know it or not but i care and i tell you i did propose and was rejected and katerina alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence 
 why what nonsense 
 but we talk about it please forgive me if been nasty said levin now that he had opened his heart he became as he had been in the morning not angry with me stiva please be angry he said and smiling he took his hand 
 of course not not a bit nor is there any reason to be glad spoken openly and do you know stand shooting in the morning is usually good why not go i might go without sleeping straight from shooting to the station

 stepan arkadyevich went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance the business of the forest was over the money in his pocket their shooting had been excellent and stepan arkadyevich was in the happiest frame of mind and therefore felt especially anxious to dissipate the that had come upon levin he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun 
 levin certainly was out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming guest he could not control his mood the aftereffects of the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him 
 kitty was not married and was ill and ill from love for a man who had slighted her this offense as it were rebounded upon him vronsky had slighted her and she had slighted him levin consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin and therefore he was his enemy but all this levin did not think of he vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him but he fell foul of everything that presented itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practised upon oblonsky and concluded in his house exasperated him 
 well finished he said meeting stepan arkadyevich upstairs would you like supper 
 well i say no to it what an appetite i get in the country wonderful why you offer riabinin something 
 oh damn him 
 still how you do treat him said oblonsky you even shake hands with him why not shake hands with him 
 because i shake hands with a waiter and a a hundred times better than he is 
 what a reactionist you are really what about the amalgamation of classes said oblonsky 
 anyone who likes it is welcome to it but it sickens me 
 a downright reactionist i see 
 really i have never considered what i am i am konstantin levin and nothing else 
 and konstantin levin very much out of temper said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes i am out of temper and do you know why because excuse me of your stupid sale 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own 
 come enough about that he said when did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale it was worth much more but when one wants to sell no one will give anything no i see a grudge against that unlucky riabinin 
 maybe i have and do you know why say again that a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which i belong and in spite of the amalgamation of classes glad to belong and their impoverishment is not due to living in luxury that would be nothing living in good style the proper thing for noblemen only the nobles who know how to do it now the peasants about us buy land and i mind that the gentleman does nothing while the peasant works and supplants the idle man as it should be and i welcome the peasant but i do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of i know what to call it innocence here a polish lessee bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a lady who lives in nice and there a merchant leases land worth ten roubles in rent the dessiatina for one rouble here for no kind of reason made that cheat a present of thirty thousand roubles 
 well what should i have done counted every tree 
 of course they must be counted you count them but riabinin did children will have means of livelihood and education while yours like as not 
 well you must excuse me but something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the done and an end of it and here come some fried eggs my favorite dish and agathya mikhailovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy 
 stepan arkadyevich sat down at the table and began jollying agathya mikhailovna assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper 
 well you praise it at any rate said agathya mikhailovna but konstantin dmitrievich no matter what you give him even a crust of bread will just eat it and walk away 
 though levin tried to control himself he was gloomy and silent he wanted to put one question to stepan arkadyevich but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevich had gone down to his room undressed again washed and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills had got into bed but levin still lingered in his room talking of various trifling matters and not daring to ask what he wanted to know 
 how wonderfully they make the soap he said gazing at a piece of soap he was unwrapping which agathya mikhailovna had placed in readiness for the guest but a brand which oblonsky did not use just look why a work of art 
 yes brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays said stepan arkadyevich with a moist and blissful yawn the theater for instance and the entertainments he yawned the electric light everywhere 
 yes the electric light said levin yes oh and vronsky now he asked suddenly laying down the soap 
 vronsky said stepan arkadyevich checking his yawn in peterburg he left soon after you did and been once in moscow since and do you know kostia tell you the truth he went on leaning his elbow on the table and with his hand propping up his handsome ruddy face in which his humid sleepy eyes shone like stars your own fault you took fright at the sight of your rival but as i told you at the time i say which had the better chance why you fight it out i told you at the time that he yawned inwardly without opening his mouth 
 does he know or he that i did propose levin wondered gazing at him yes something humbugging something diplomatic in his face and feeling he was blushing he looked stepan arkadyevich straight in the face without speaking 
 if there was anything on her side at that time it was nothing but a superficial attraction pursued oblonsky his being such a perfect aristocrat you know and his future position in society had an influence not with her but with her mother 
 levin scowled the humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received but he was at home and the walls of home are a support 
 wait wait he began interrupting oblonsky you talk of his being an aristocrat but allow me to ask what it consists of that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which i can be looked down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but i a man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother god knows whom she mixed up with no excuse me but i consider myself aristocratic and people like me who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family of the highest degree of breeding talent and intellect of course are another matter and have never curried favor with anyone never depended on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and i know many such you think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest while you make riabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get from the government your liferent and i know what while i shall not and so i prize come to me from my ancestors or has been won by hard work we are aristocrats and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful ones of this earth and who can be bought for twenty kopecks 
 well but whom are you attacking i agree with you said stepan arkadyevich sincerely and genially though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twenty kopecks levin was reckoning him as well animation gave him genuine pleasure whom are you attacking a good deal of what you say is not true about vronsky of course but i talk about that i tell you straight out if i were you i should go back with me to moscow and 
 no i know whether you know it or not but i care and i tell you i did propose and was rejected and katerina alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence 
 why what nonsense 
 but we talk about it please forgive me if been nasty said levin now that he had opened his heart he became as he had been in the morning not angry with me stiva please be angry he said and smiling he took his hand 
 of course not not a bit nor is there any reason to be glad spoken openly and do you know stand shooting in the morning is usually good why not go i might go without sleeping straight from shooting to the station

 chapter 
 
 although all inner life was absorbed in his passion his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests the interests of his regiment took an important place in life both because he was fond of the regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him they were not only fond of vronsky in his regiment they respected him too and were proud of him proud that this man with his immense wealth his brilliant education and abilities and the path open before him to every kind of success distinction and ambition had disregarded all that and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart vronsky was aware of his comrades view of him and in addition to his liking for that sort of life he felt bound to keep up that reputation 
 it need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself and he closed the mouths of any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his liaison but in spite of that his love was known to all the town everyone guessed with more or less certainty at his relations with madame karenina the majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted position of karenin and the consequent transparency to society of their liaison 
 the greater number of the young women who envied anna and had long been weary of having her called righteous rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn they were already making ready their handfuls of mud to cast at her when the right moment arrived the greater number of the people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society 
 mother on hearing of his liaison was at first pleased by it because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society she was pleased too that madame karenina who had so taken her fancy and had talked so much of her son was after all just like all the other pretty and decent women according to the countess ideas but she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career simply in order to remain in the regiment where could be constantly seeing madame karenina she heard that great personages were displeased with him on this account and she changed her opinion she was vexed too that from all she could learn of this liaison it was not that brilliant graceful worldly liaison which she would have welcomed but a sort of desperate passion so she was told which might well lead him into follies she had not seen him since his abrupt departure from moscow and she sent her elder son to bid him to come to her 
 this elder brother too was displeased with his younger brother he did not distinguish what sort of love his might be big or little passionate or passionless pure or impure he kept a ballet girl himself though he was the father of a family so he was rather indulgent but he knew that this love displeased those whom it was necessary to please and therefore he did not approve of his conduct 
 besides the service and society vronsky had another great interest horses he was passionately fond of horses 
 that year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers vronsky had put his name down bought a thoroughbred english mare and in spite of his love he was looking forward to the races with intense though reserved excitement 
 these two passions did not interfere with one another on the contrary he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him

 on the day of the races at krasnoe selo vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment he had no need to be strict with himself as his weight was exactly the required one but still he had to avoid gaining flesh and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes he sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat resting both elbows on the table and while waiting for the steak he had ordered was looking over a french novel that lay open on his plate he was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out he was thinking 
 he was thinking of promise to see him today after the races but he had not seen her for three days and as her husband had just returned from abroad he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not and he did not know how to find out he had had his last interview with her at his cousin summer villa he visited the summer villa of the karenins as rarely as possible now he wanted to go there and he pondered the question of how to do it 
 of course i shall say betsy has sent me to ask whether coming to the races of course go he decided lifting his head from the book and as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her his face lighted up 
 send to my house and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quickly as they can he said to the servant who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish and moving the dish up toward him he began eating 
 from the adjoining billiard room came the sound of balls clicking of talk and laughter two officers appeared at the entrance door one a young fellow with a weak delicate face who had lately joined the regiment from the corps of pages the other a plump elderly officer with a bracelet on his wrist and little eyes lost in fat 
 vronsky glanced at them frowned and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them he proceeded to eat and read at the same time 
 what fortifying yourself for your work said the plump officer sitting down beside him 
 as you see responded vronsky knitting his brows wiping his mouth and without looking at the officer 
 so not afraid of getting fat said the latter turning a chair round for the young officer 
 what said vronsky angrily making a wry face of disgust and showing his heavy teeth 
 not afraid of getting fat 
 waiter sherry said vronsky without replying and moving the book to the other side of him he went on reading 
 the plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer 
 you choose what to drink he said handing him the card and looking at him 
 rhine wine please said the young officer stealing a timid glance at vronsky and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache seeing that vronsky did not turn round the young officer got up 
 go into the billiard room he said 
 the plump officer rose submissively and they moved toward the door 
 at that moment there walked into the room the tan and captain iashvin nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers he went up to vronsky 
 ah here he is he cried bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet vronsky looked round angrily but his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of calm and firm friendliness 
 it aliosha said the captain in his loud baritone have a bite and drink one tiny glass 
 oh not very hungry 
 there go the inseparables iashvin dropped glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room and he bent his long legs swathed in tight riding breeches and sat down in the chair too low for him so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle why you turn up at theater at krasnoe selo yesterday numerova at all bad where were you 
 i was late at the tverskys said vronsky 
 ah responded iashvin 
 iashvin a gambler and a rake a man not merely without any principles but of immoral principles iashvin was greatest friend in the regiment vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish and to do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it and for his great strength of character which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers commanding both fear and respect and also at cards when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the english club vronsky respected and liked iashvin particularly because he felt iashvin liked him not for his name and his money but for himself and of all men he was the only one with whom vronsky would have liked to speak of his love he felt that iashvin in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling was the only man who could so he fancied comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life moreover he felt certain that iashvin as it was took no delight in gossip and scandal and interpreted his feeling rightly that is to say knew and believed that this passion was not a joke not a pastime but something more serious and important 
 vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion but he was aware that he knew all about it and that he put the right interpretation on it and he was glad to see this in his eyes 
 ah yes he said to the announcement that vronsky had been at the tverskys and his black eyes shining he plucked at his left mustache and began twisting it into his mouth a bad habit he had 
 well and what did you do yesterday win anything asked vronsky 
 eight thousand but three count the chap will hardly pay up

 and the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race the only thing vronsky could think of just now

 where are you off to asked iashvin oh here is your troika he added seeing the carriage drive up 
 to the stables and got to see briansky too about the horses said vronsky 
 vronsky had as a fact promised to call at some ten verstas from peterhof and to bring him money owing for some horses and he hoped to have time to get that in too but his comrades were at once aware that that was not the only place he was going 
 petritsky still humming winked and made a pout with his lips as though he would say oh yes we know your briansky 
 mind not late was only comment and to change the conversation my roan is he doing all right he inquired looking out of the window at the shaft horse which he had sold to vronsky 
 stop cried petritsky to vronsky just as he was going out your brother left a letter and a note for you wait a bit where are they 
 vronsky stopped 
 well where are they 
 where are they just the question said petritsky solemnly sliding his forefinger upward along his nose 
 come tell me this is silly said vronsky smiling 
 i lighted the fire they must be here somewhere 
 come enough fooling where is the letter 
 no forgotten really or was it a dream wait a bit wait a bit but the use of getting in a rage if drunk four bottles per man yesterday as i did forget where you were at wait a bit remember 
 petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed 
 wait a bit this was how i was lying and this was how he was standing yes yes yes here it is and petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress where he had hidden it 
 vronsky took the letter and his note it was the letter he was expecting from his mother reproaching him for not having been to see her and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing what business is it of theirs thought vronsky and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road in the porch of the hut he was met by two officers one of his regiment and one of another 
 quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers 
 where are you off to 
 i must go to peterhof 
 has the mare come from tsarskoe 
 yes but not seen her yet 
 they say lame

 well you did make it hot for us yesterday said one of those who had come in you let us get a wink of sleep all night 
 oh we make a pretty finish said petritsky volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was i said have music the funeral march he fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march 
 drink it up you positively must drink the vodka and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon said iashvin standing over petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine and then a little champagne just a wee bottle 
 come some sense in that stop a bit vronsky all have a drink 
 no all of you not going to drink today 
 why are you gaining weight all right then we must have it alone give us the seltzer water and lemon 
 vronsky shouted someone when he was already outside 
 well 
 better get your hair cut weigh you down especially at the bald place 
 vronsky was in fact beginning prematurely to get a little bald he laughed gaily showing his heavy teeth and pulling his cap over the thin place went out and got into his carriage 
 to the stables he said and was just pulling out the letters to read them through but thought better of it and put off reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare later on

 stop cried petritsky to vronsky just as he was going out your brother left a letter and a note for you wait a bit where are they 
 vronsky stopped 
 well where are they 
 where are they just the question said petritsky solemnly sliding his forefinger upward along his nose 
 come tell me this is silly said vronsky smiling 
 i lighted the fire they must be here somewhere 
 come enough fooling where is the letter 
 no forgotten really or was it a dream wait a bit wait a bit but the use of getting in a rage if drunk four bottles per man yesterday as i did forget where you were at wait a bit remember 
 petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed 
 wait a bit this was how i was lying and this was how he was standing yes yes yes here it is and petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress where he had hidden it 
 vronsky took the letter and his note it was the letter he was expecting from his mother reproaching him for not having been to see her and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing what business is it of theirs thought vronsky and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road in the porch of the hut he was met by two officers one of his regiment and one of another 
 quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers 
 where are you off to 
 i must go to peterhof 
 has the mare come from tsarskoe 
 yes but not seen her yet 
 they say lame 
 nonsense however are you going to race in this mud said the other 
 here are my saviors cried petritsky seeing them come in before him stood the batman with vodka and pickled cucumbers on a tray iashvin ordering me to drink a 
 well you did make it hot for us yesterday said one of those who had come in you let us get a wink of sleep all night 
 oh we make a pretty finish said petritsky volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was i said have music the funeral march he fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march 
 drink it up you positively must drink the vodka and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon said iashvin standing over petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine and then a little champagne just a wee bottle 
 come some sense in that stop a bit vronsky all have a drink 
 no all of you not going to drink today 
 why are you gaining weight all right then we must have it alone give us the seltzer water and lemon 
 vronsky shouted someone when he was already outside 
 well 
 better get your hair cut weigh you down especially at the bald place 
 vronsky was in fact beginning prematurely to get a little bald he laughed gaily showing his heavy teeth and pulling his cap over the thin place went out and got into his carriage 
 to the stables he said and was just pulling out the letters to read them through but thought better of it and put off reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare later on

 the temporary stable a wooden booth had been put up close to the racecourse and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day he had not yet seen her there during the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself but had put her in the charge of the trainer and so now he absolutely did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday or was in today he had scarcely got out of his carriage when his stableboy groom recognizing the carriage some way off called the trainer a englishman in high boots and a short jacket except for a tuft below his chin came to meet him walking with the uncouth gait of a jockey turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side 
 well vronsky asked in english 
 all right sir the voice responded somewhere far down in his throat better not go in he added touching his hat put a muzzle on her and the fidgety better not go in excite the mare 
 no going in i want to look at her 
 come along then said the englishman frowning and speaking with his mouth shut and with swinging elbows he went on in front with his disjointed gait 
 they went into the little yard in front of the shed the stableboy on duty spruce and smart in his holiday attire met them with a broom in his hand and followed them in the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls and vronsky knew that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse had been brought there and must be standing among them even more than his mare vronsky longed to see gladiator whom he had never seen but vronsky knew that by the etiquette of the racecourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse but improper even to ask questions about him just as he was passing along the passage the boy opened the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs he knew that this was gladiator but with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another open letter he turned round and went into stall 
 the stall belonging to mak i never can say the name is here said the englishman over his shoulder pointing his thumb toward stall 
 makhotin yes my most serious rival said vronsky 
 if you were riding him said the englishman bet on you 
 more nervous while the other is more powerful said vronsky smiling at the compliment to his riding 
 in a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck said the englishman 
 of pluck that is energy and courage vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough what was of far more importance he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this pluck than he had 
 you think i want more sweating down 
 oh no answered the englishman please speak loud the fidgety he added nodding toward the horse box before which they were standing and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw 
 he opened the door and vronsky went into the horse box dimly lighted by one little window in the horse box stood a dark bay mare with a muzzle on shifting her feet on the fresh straw looking round him in the twilight of the horse box vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare was an animal of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a point of view she was all over though her chest was extremely prominent in front it was narrow her hindquarters were a little drooping and in her forelegs and still more in her hind legs there was a noticeable curvature the muscles of both hind legs and forelegs were not very thick but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side she looked altogether except across the shoulders apparently pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten that quality was blood the blood that tells as the english expression has it the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews covered with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they were hard as bone her head with prominent bright spirited eyes broadened out at the open nostrils that showed the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there was a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she was one of those creatures which seem devoid of speech only because the mechanism of their mouths does not allow of it 
 to vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment as he looked at her 
 directly vronsky went toward her she drew in a deep breath and turning back her prominent eye tin the white looked bloodshot she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side shaking her muzzle and shifting lightly from one leg to the other 
 there you see how fidgety she is said the englishman 
 whoa darling whoa said vronsky going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her 
 but the nearer he came the more excited she grew only when he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter while the muscles quivered under her soft delicate coat vronsky patted her strong neck straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side and moved his face near her dilated nostrils transparent as a wing she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils started pricked up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip toward vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remembering the muzzle she shook it and again began restlessly stamping her shapely legs one after the other 
 calm down darling calm down he said patting her again over her hindquarters and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition he went out of the horse box 
 the excitement had infected vronsky he felt that his heart was throbbing and that he too like the mare longed to move to bite it was both fearful and delicious 
 well i rely on you then he said to the englishman six on the ground 
 all right said the englishman oh where are you going my lord he asked suddenly using the title my lord which he scarcely ever used 
 vronsky in amazement raised his head and stared as he knew how to stare not into the eyes but at his forehead astounded at the impertinence of his question but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer but as a jockey he answered 
 got to go to i shall be home within an hour 
 how often asked that question today he said to himself and he blushed a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him and as though he too knew where vronsky was going he added 
 the great thing is to keep quiet before a race said he get out of temper or upset about anything 
 all right answered vronsky smiling and jumping into his carriage he told the man to drive to peterhof 
 before he had driven many paces away the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke and there was a heavy downpour of rain 
 what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his letter and his note and read them through 
 yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer to me than life and this is incomprehensible and why it annoys them whatever our destiny is or may be we have made it ourselves and we do not complain of it he said in the word we linking himself with anna no they must needs teach us how to live they an idea of what happiness is they know that without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all he thought 
 he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they all these people were right he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigues do pass leaving no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant memories he felt all the torture of his own position and hers all the difficulty in store for them conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world in concealing their love in lying and deceiving and in lying deceiving feigning and continually thinking of others when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love 
 he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which were so against his natural bent he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his relations with anna this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexei alexandrovich or for himself or for the whole world he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling now too he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts 
 yes she was unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she does not show it yes we must put an end to it he decided 
 and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position and the sooner the better abandon everything must we she and i and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love he said to himself

 the shower did not last long and by the time vronsky arrived his shaft horse trotting at full speed and dragging the off horses galloping through the mud with their reins hanging loose the sun had peeped out again the roofs of the summer villas and the old lime trees in the gardens on both sides of the high street sparkled with wet brilliance and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water he thought no more of shower spoiling the racecourse but was now rejoicing because thanks to the rain he would be sure to find her at home and alone as he knew that alexei alexandrovich who had lately returned from a watering place had not moved from peterburg 
 hoping to find her alone vronsky alighted as he always did to avoid attracting attention before crossing the bridge and walked to the house he did not go up the steps to the street door but went into the court 
 has your master come he asked a gardener 
 no sir the mistress is at home but will you please go to the front door there are servants there the gardener answered open the door 
 no go in from the garden 
 and feeling satisfied that she was alone and wanting to take her by surprise since he had not promised to be there today and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races he walked holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path bordered with flowers to the terrace that looked out upon the garden vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of his position he thought of nothing but that he would see her directly not in imagination but living all of her as she was in reality he was just going in stepping on his whole foot so as not to make a noise up the worn steps of the terrace when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her her son with his questioning and as he fancied hostile eyes 
 this boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom when he was present both vronsky and anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand they had made no agreement about this it had been settled of itself they would have felt it as wounding themselves to deceive the child in his presence they talked like acquaintances but in spite of this caution vronsky often saw the intent bewildered glance fixed upon him and a strange shyness uncertainty at one time there was friendliness at another coldness and reserve in the manner to him as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond the significance of which he could not understand 
 as a matter of fact the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation and he tried painfully yet was unable to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he saw distinctly that his father his governess his nurse all not merely disliked vronsky but looked on him with horror and aversion though they never said anything about him while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend 
 what does it mean who is he how ought i to love him if i know my fault either stupid or a naughty boy thought the child and this was what caused his dubious inquiring sometimes hostile expression and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky found so irksome this presence always and infallibly called up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late this presence called up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one but that to arrest his motion is not in his power that every instant is carrying him farther and farther away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is tantamount to admitting his certain ruin 
 this child with his innocent outlook upon life was the compass that showed them the point at which they had departed from what they knew yet did not want to know 
 this time seriozha was not at home and she was completely alone she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son who had gone out for a stroll and had been caught in the rain she had sent out a manservant and a maid to look for him and was sitting here waiting for them dressed in a white gown deeply embroidered she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers and did not hear him bending her curly dark head she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet and both her lovely hands with the rings he knew so well clasped the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hands struck vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stood still gazing at her in ecstasy but directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her she was aware of his presence pushed away the watering pot and turned her flushed face toward him 
 the matter are you unwell he said to her in french going up to her he would have run to her but remembering that there might be outsiders he looked round toward the balcony door and reddened as he always reddened feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard 
 no quite well she said getting up and squeezing his outstretched hand tightly i did not expect thee 
 my god what cold hands he said 
 you startled me she said alone and expecting seriozha out for a walk come from this direction 
 but in spite of her efforts to be calm her lips were quivering 
 forgive me for coming but i pass the day without seeing you he went on speaking french as he always did to avoid using the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between them and the dangerously intimate singular 
 forgive for what so glad 
 but ill or worried he went on without letting go her hands and bending over her what were you thinking of 
 always of the same thing she said with a smile 
 she spoke the truth if ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of she could have answered truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she was thinking just when he came upon her of this why was it she wondered that to others to betsy for instance she knew of her secret connection with tushkevich all this was so easy while to her it was such torture today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations she asked him about the races he answered her questions and seeing that she was agitated trying to calm her he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races 
 shall i tell him or not she thought looking into his calm affable eyes he is so happy so absorbed in his races that he understand as he should he understand all the significance of this event to us 
 but you told me what you were thinking of when i came in he said interrupting his narrative pray tell me 
 she did not answer and bending her head a little she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows her eyes shining under their long lashes her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked he saw it and his face expressed that utter subjection that slavish devotion which had done so much to win her 
 i see something has happened do you suppose i can be at peace knowing you have a trouble i am not sharing tell me for sake he repeated imploringly 
 yes i be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the significance of it better not tell why put him to the proof she thought still staring at him in the same way and feeling that her hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more 
 for sake he repeated taking her hand 
 shall i tell you 
 yes yes yes 
 i am pregnant she said softly and slowly 
 the leaf in her hand shook more violently but she did not take her eyes off him watching how he would take it he turned pale would have said something but stopped he dropped her hand and his head sank on his breast yes he realizes all the significance of the fact she thought and gratefully she pressed his hand 
 but she was mistaken in thinking he realized the significance of the news as she a woman realized it on hearing it he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he realized that the turning point he had been longing for had come now that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affected him in the same way he looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness kissed her hand got up and in silence paced up and down the terrace 
 yes he said going up to her resolutely neither you nor i have looked on our relations as a passing amusement and now our fate is sealed it is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he spoke to the deception in which we are living 
 put an end put an end how alexei she said softly 
 she was calmer now and her face lighted up with a tender smile 
 leave your husband and make our life one 
 it is one as it is she answered scarcely audibly 
 yes but completely completely 
 but how alexei tell me how she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own situation is there any way out of such a situation am i not the wife of my husband 
 there is a way out of every situation we must take our stand he said better than the situation in which living of course i see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband 
 oh not over my husband she said with a plain smile i know him i think of him he exist 
 not speaking sincerely i know you you worry about him too 
 oh he even know she said and suddenly a hot flush came over her face her cheeks her brow her neck crimsoned and tears of shame came into her eyes but let us not even talk of him

 this time seriozha was not at home and she was completely alone she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son who had gone out for a stroll and had been caught in the rain she had sent out a manservant and a maid to look for him and was sitting here waiting for them dressed in a white gown deeply embroidered she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers and did not hear him bending her curly dark head she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet and both her lovely hands with the rings he knew so well clasped the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hands struck vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stood still gazing at her in ecstasy but directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her she was aware of his presence pushed away the watering pot and turned her flushed face toward him 
 the matter are you unwell he said to her in french going up to her he would have run to her but remembering that there might be outsiders he looked round toward the balcony door and reddened as he always reddened feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard 
 no quite well she said getting up and squeezing his outstretched hand tightly i did not expect thee 
 my god what cold hands he said 
 you startled me she said alone and expecting seriozha out for a walk come from this direction 
 but in spite of her efforts to be calm her lips were quivering 
 forgive me for coming but i pass the day without seeing you he went on speaking french as he always did to avoid using the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between them and the dangerously intimate singular 
 forgive for what so glad 
 but ill or worried he went on without letting go her hands and bending over her what were you thinking of 
 always of the same thing she said with a smile 
 she spoke the truth if ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of she could have answered truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she was thinking just when he came upon her of this why was it she wondered that to others to betsy for instance she knew of her secret connection with tushkevich all this was so easy while to her it was such torture today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations she asked him about the races he answered her questions and seeing that she was agitated trying to calm her he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races 
 shall i tell him or not she thought looking into his calm affable eyes he is so happy so absorbed in his races that he understand as he should he understand all the significance of this event to us 
 but you told me what you were thinking of when i came in he said interrupting his narrative pray tell me 
 she did not answer and bending her head a little she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows her eyes shining under their long lashes her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked he saw it and his face expressed that utter subjection that slavish devotion which had done so much to win her 
 i see something has happened do you suppose i can be at peace knowing you have a trouble i am not sharing tell me for sake he repeated imploringly 
 yes i be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the significance of it better not tell why put him to the proof she thought still staring at him in the same way and feeling that her hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more 
 for sake he repeated taking her hand 
 shall i tell you 
 yes yes yes 
 i am pregnant she said softly and slowly 
 the leaf in her hand shook more violently but she did not take her eyes off him watching how he would take it he turned pale would have said something but stopped he dropped her hand and his head sank on his breast yes he realizes all the significance of the fact she thought and gratefully she pressed his hand 
 but she was mistaken in thinking he realized the significance of the news as she a woman realized it on hearing it he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he realized that the turning point he had been longing for had come now that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affected him in the same way he looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness kissed her hand got up and in silence paced up and down the terrace 
 yes he said going up to her resolutely neither you nor i have looked on our relations as a passing amusement and now our fate is sealed it is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he spoke to the deception in which we are living 
 put an end put an end how alexei she said softly 
 she was calmer now and her face lighted up with a tender smile 
 leave your husband and make our life one 
 it is one as it is she answered scarcely audibly 
 yes but completely completely 
 but how alexei tell me how she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own situation is there any way out of such a situation am i not the wife of my husband 
 there is a way out of every situation we must take our stand he said better than the situation in which living of course i see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband 
 oh not over my husband she said with a plain smile i know him i think of him he exist 
 not speaking sincerely i know you you worry about him too 
 oh he even know she said and suddenly a hot flush came over her face her cheeks her brow her neck crimsoned and tears of shame came into her eyes but let us not even talk of him

 vronsky had several times already though not so resolutely as now tried to bring her to consider her position and every time he had been confronted by the same superficiality and frivolity with which she met his appeal now it was as though there were something in this which she could not or would not face as though directly she began to speak of this she the real anna retreated somehow into herself and another strange and unaccountable woman came out whom he did not love and whom he feared and who was in opposition to him but today he was resolved to have it out 
 whether he knows or not said vronsky in his usual calm and firm tone whether he knows or not has nothing to do with us we cannot you cannot stay like this especially now 
 to be done according to you she asked with the same frivolous irony she who had so feared he would take her condition too frivolously was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step 
 tell him everything and leave him 
 very well let us suppose i do that she said do you know what the result of that would be i can tell you it all beforehand and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes that had been so tender a minute before eh you love another man and have entered into a criminal liaison with him mimicking her husband she threw an emphasis on the word criminal as alexei alexandrovich did i warned you of the results in the religious the civil and the domestic aspects you have not listened to me now i cannot let you disgrace my name and my son she had meant to say but about her son she could not jest disgrace my name and and more in the same style she added in general terms say in his official manner and with all distinctness and precision that he cannot let me go but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal and he will calmly and punctiliously act in accordance with his words what will happen not a man but a machine and a spiteful machine when angry she added recalling alexei alexandrovich as she spoke with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him forgiving him nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him 
 but anna said vronsky in a soft and persuasive voice trying to soothe her we absolutely must tell him at any rate and then be guided by the line he takes 
 what run away 
 and why not run away i see how we can keep on like this and not for my sake i see that you suffer 
 yes run away and become your mistress she said angrily 
 anna he said with reproachful tenderness 
 yes she went on become your mistress and complete the ruin of 
 again she would have said my son but she could not utter that word 
 vronsky could not understand how she with her strong and truthful nature could endure this state of deceit and not long to get out of it but he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word son which she could not utter when she thought of her son and his future attitude to his mother who had abandoned his father she felt such terror at what she had done that she no longer reasoned but being a woman could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances and words so that everything should remain as it always had been and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son 
 i beg you i entreat you she said suddenly taking his hand and speaking in quite a different tone sincere and tender never speak to me of that 
 but anna 
 never leave it to me i know all the baseness all the horror of my position but not so easy to decide as you think therefore leave it to me and do what i say never speak to me of it do you promise me no no promise 
 i promise everything but i be at peace especially after what you have told me i be at peace when you be at peace 
 i she repeated yes i am worried sometimes but that will pass if you will never talk about this when you talk about it only then it worries me 
 i understand he said 
 i know she interrupted him how hard it is for your truthful nature to lie and i grieve for you i often think how could you ruin your whole life for me 
 i was just thinking the very same thing he said how could you sacrifice everything for my sake i forgive myself because unhappy 
 i unhappy she said coming closer to him and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love i am like a hungry man who has been given food he may be cold and dressed in rags and ashamed but he is not unhappy i unhappy no this is my happiness 
 she could hear the sound of her voice coming toward them and glancing swiftly round the terrace she got up impulsively her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well with a rapid movement she raised her lovely hands covered with rings took his head looked into his face with a protracted gaze and putting up her face with smiling parted lips swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes and thrust him away she would have gone but he held her back 
 when he murmured in a whisper gazing in ecstasy at her 
 tonight at one she whispered and with a heavy sigh she walked with her light swift step to meet her son 
 seriozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden and he and his nurse had taken shelter in a bower 
 well au revoir she said to vronsky i must soon be getting ready for the races betsy promised to fetch me

 chapter 
 
 when vronsky had looked at his watch on the karenins balcony he had been so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that although he saw the hands on the face of his watch he could not take in what time it was he came out onto the highroad and walked picking his way carefully through the mud to his carriage he was so completely absorbed in his feeling for anna that he did not even think what it was and whether he had time to go to he preserved as often happens only the external faculty of memory that points out each step one has to take one after the other he went up to his coachman who was dozing on the box in the shadow already lengthening of a thick lime tree he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses and waking the coachman he jumped into the carriage and told him to drive to it was only after driving nearly seven verstas that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch and realize that it was half past five and that he was late 
 there were several races set for that day the body guards race then the officers race then the race and then the race for which he was entered he could still be in right time for his race but if he went to he could be only in full time and he would arrive when the whole court would be in their places that would be a pity but he had promised briansky to come and so he decided to drive on telling the coachman not to spare the horses 
 he reached spent five minutes there and galloped back this rapid drive calmed him all that was painful in his relations with anna all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation had slipped out of his mind he was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race of his being in time after all and now and then the thought of the happiness of this assignation flashed across his imagination like a dazzling light 
 the excitement of the approaching race gained upon him more and more as he drove farther and farther into the atmosphere of the races overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of peterburg 
 there was no longer anyone at home at his quarters all were at the races and his valet was looking out for him at the gate while he was changing his clothes his valet told him that the second race had begun already that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him and a boy had twice run up from the stables 
 dressing without hurry he never hurried himself and never lost his vronsky drove to the sheds from the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages and people on foot soldiers surrounding the racecourse and pavilions swarming with people the second race was apparently going on for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing going toward the stable he met the chestnut gladiator being led to the racecourse in a blue and orange horsecloth with what looked like huge ears edged with blue 
 cord he asked the stableboy 
 in the stable putting on the saddle 
 in the open horse box stood saddled ready they were just going to lead her out 
 not too late 
 all right all right said the englishman upset yourself 
 vronsky once more took in at one glance the beautiful lines of his favorite mare who was quivering all over and with an effort he tore himself from the sight of her and went out of the stable he went toward the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention the race was just finishing and all eyes were fixed on the cavalry guard in front and the light hussar behind urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post from the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post and a group of soldiers and officers of the cavalry guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race and the tall cavalry guard who came in first leaning over the saddle let go the reins of his panting gray stallion that looked dark with sweat 
 the stallion stiffening out his legs with an effort stopped his rapid course and the officer of the cavalry guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep and just managed to smile a crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him 
 vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of upper world which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions he knew that madame karenina was there and betsy and his wife and he purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his attention but he was continually met and stopped by acquaintances who told him about the previous races and kept asking him why he was so late 
 at the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes and all attention was directed to that point elder brother alexandre a colonel with the shoulder knot came up to him he was not tall though as broadly built as alexei and handsomer and rosier than he he had a red nose and an open tipsy face 
 did you get my note he said never any finding you 
 alexandre vronsky in spite of his dissolute life and particularly his drunken habits for which he was notorious was quite one of the court circle 
 now as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him he kept a smiling countenance as though he were jesting with his brother about something of little moment 
 i got it and i really make out what you are worrying yourself about said alexei 
 worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you here and that you were seen in peterhof on monday 
 there are matters which only concern those directly interested in them and the matter you are so worried about is of that nature 
 yes but if so one does not belong in the service one does not 
 i beg you not to meddle and that is all 
 alexei frowning face turned pale and his prominent lower jaw quivered which happened rarely with him being a man of very warm heart he was seldom angry but when he was angry and when his chin quivered then as alexandre vronsky knew he was dangerous alexandre vronsky smiled gaily 
 i only wanted to give you letter answer it and worry about anything just before the race bonne chance he added smiling and he moved away from him but after him another friendly greeting brought vronsky to a standstill 
 so you recognize your friends how are you mon cher said stepan arkadyevich as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the peterburg brilliance as he was in moscow his face rosy and his whiskers sleek and glossy i came up yesterday and delighted because i shall see your triumph when shall we meet 
 come tomorrow to the messroom said vronsky and squeezing him by the sleeve of his greatcoat with apologies he moved away to the center of the racecourse where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase 
 the horses who had run in the last race were being led home steaming and exhausted by the stableboys and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance for the most part english racers wearing horsecloths and looking with their bellies like strange huge birds on the right was led in lean and beautiful lifting up her elastic rather long pasterns as though moved by springs not far from her they were taking the caparison off the gladiator the strong exquisite perfectly correct lines of the stallion with his superb hindquarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his hoofs attracted attention in spite of himself he would have gone up to his mare but he was again detained by an acquaintance 
 oh karenin said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting looking for his wife and in the middle of the pavilion you see her 
 no i answered vronsky and without even glancing round toward the pavilion where his friend was pointing out madame karenina he went up to his mare 
 vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle about which he had to give some direction when the entrants were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting seventeen officers looking serious and severe many with pale faces met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers vronsky drew number the cry was heard mount 
 feeling that with the others riding in the race he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became dilatory and calm in his movements cord in honor of the races had put on his best clothes a black coat buttoned up a stiffly starched collar which propped up his cheeks a black bowler and hessian boots he was calm and dignified as ever and was with his own hands holding by both reins standing straight in front of her was still trembling as though in a fever her eye full of fire glanced sideways at vronsky vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle girth the mare glanced aslant at him drew up her lip and twitched her ear the englishman puckered up his lips intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling 
 get up you feel so excited 
 vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals he knew that he would not see them during the race two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start galtsin a friend of and one of his more formidable rivals was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount a little hussar of the life guards in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop crouched up like a cat over the porridge in imitation of english jockeys prince kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the grabovsky stud while an english groom led her by the bridle vronsky and all his comrades knew kuzovlev and his peculiarity of weak nerves and terrible vanity they knew that he was afraid of everything afraid of riding a line horse but now just because it was terrible because people broke their necks and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle and an ambulance with a cross on it and a sister of mercy he had made up his mind to take part in the race their eyes met and vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod only one he did not see his chief rival makhotin on gladiator 
 be in a hurry said cord to vronsky and remember one thing hold her in at the fences and urge her on let her go as she likes 
 all right all right said vronsky taking the reins 
 if you can lead the race but lose heart till the last minute even if behind 
 before the mare had time to move vronsky stepped with an agile vigorous movement into the stirrup and lightly and firmly placed his compacted body on the creaking leather of the saddle getting his right foot in the stirrup he with habitual moving smoothed the double reins between his fingers and cord let go as though she did not know which foot to put first started dragging at the reins with her long neck and as though she were on springs shaking her rider from side to side cord quickened his step following him the excited mare trying to deceive her rider pulled at the reins first on one side and then the other and vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her 
 they were just reaching the stream on their way to the starting point several of the riders were in front and several behind when suddenly vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the behind him and he was overtaken by makhotin on his gladiator makhotin smiled showing his long teeth but vronsky looked at him angrily he did not like him and regarded him now as his most formidable rival he was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his mare started into a gallop her left foot forward made two bounds and fretting at the tightened reins passed into a jolting trot bumping her rider up and down cord too scowled and followed vronsky almost ambling

 feeling that with the others riding in the race he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became dilatory and calm in his movements cord in honor of the races had put on his best clothes a black coat buttoned up a stiffly starched collar which propped up his cheeks a black bowler and hessian boots he was calm and dignified as ever and was with his own hands holding by both reins standing straight in front of her was still trembling as though in a fever her eye full of fire glanced sideways at vronsky vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle girth the mare glanced aslant at him drew up her lip and twitched her ear the englishman puckered up his lips intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling 
 get up you feel so excited 
 vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals he knew that he would not see them during the race two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start galtsin a friend of and one of his more formidable rivals was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount a little hussar of the life guards in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop crouched up like a cat over the porridge in imitation of english jockeys prince kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the grabovsky stud while an english groom led her by the bridle vronsky and all his comrades knew kuzovlev and his peculiarity of weak nerves and terrible vanity they knew that he was afraid of everything afraid of riding a line horse but now just because it was terrible because people broke their necks and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle and an ambulance with a cross on it and a sister of mercy he had made up his mind to take part in the race their eyes met and vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod only one he did not see his chief rival makhotin on gladiator 
 be in a hurry said cord to vronsky and remember one thing hold her in at the fences and urge her on let her go as she likes 
 all right all right said vronsky taking the reins 
 if you can lead the race but lose heart till the last minute even if behind 
 before the mare had time to move vronsky stepped with an agile vigorous movement into the stirrup and lightly and firmly placed his compacted body on the creaking leather of the saddle getting his right foot in the stirrup he with habitual moving smoothed the double reins between his fingers and cord let go as though she did not know which foot to put first started dragging at the reins with her long neck and as though she were on springs shaking her rider from side to side cord quickened his step following him the excited mare trying to deceive her rider pulled at the reins first on one side and then the other and vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her 
 they were just reaching the stream on their way to the starting point several of the riders were in front and several behind when suddenly vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the behind him and he was overtaken by makhotin on his gladiator makhotin smiled showing his long teeth but vronsky looked at him angrily he did not like him and regarded him now as his most formidable rival he was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his mare started into a gallop her left foot forward made two bounds and fretting at the tightened reins passed into a jolting trot bumping her rider up and down cord too scowled and followed vronsky almost ambling

 there were seventeen officers in all riding in this race the racecourse was a large ring in the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion on this course nine obstacles had been arranged the stream a big and solid barrier two arsheenes high just before the pavilion a dry ditch a ditch full of water a precipitous slope an irish barricade one of the most difficult obstacles consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or possibly be killed then two more ditches filled with water and one dry one and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion but the race began not in the ring but a hundred arsheenes away from it and in that part of the course was the first obstacle a stream three arsheenes in breadth which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred 
 three times they were ranged ready to start but each time some horse thrust itself out of line and they had to begin again the starter colonel sestrin was beginning to lose his temper when at last for the fourth time he shouted away and the riders started 
 every eye every opera glass was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start 
 off starting was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation 
 and little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view in the very first minute the close group of horsemen spread out and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another to the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them 
 excited and overnervous had lost the first moment and several horses had started before her but before reaching the stream vronsky who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle easily overtook three and there were left in front of him chestnut gladiator whose hindquarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of vronsky and in front of all the dainty mare diana bearing the more dead than alive kuzovlev 
 for the first instant vronsky was not master either of himself or his mare up to the first obstacle the stream he could not guide the motions of his mare 
 gladiator and diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant at a stroke they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side darted after them easily as if flying but at the very moment when vronsky felt himself in the air he suddenly saw almost under his hoofs kuzovlev who was floundering with diana on the further side of the stream kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap and the mare had fallen together with him over her head those details vronsky learned later at the moment all he saw was that just under him where must alight legs or head might be in the way but drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping like a falling cat and clearing the other mare alighted beyond her 
 oh you darling flashed through head 
 after crossing the stream vronsky had complete control of his mare and began holding her in intending to cross the great barrier behind makhotin and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about two hundred sazhenes that followed it 
 the great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion the czar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them at him and at makhotin a length ahead of him as they drew near the devil as the solid barrier was called vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare the ground racing to meet him and the back and white legs of gladiator beating time swiftly before him and keeping always the same distance ahead gladiator rose with no sound of knocking against anything with a wave of his short tail he disappeared from sight 
 bravo cried a voice 
 at the same instant under eyes right before him flashed the palings of the barrier without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it the palings vanished and he heard only a crash behind him the mare excited by keeping ahead had risen too soon before the barrier and grazed it with one of her hind hoofs but her pace never changed and vronsky feeling a spatter of mud in his face realized that he was once more the same distance from gladiator once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away 
 at the very moment when vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake makhotin herself understanding his thoughts without any incitement on his part gained considerably and began getting alongside of makhotin on the most favorable side close to the inner rope makhotin would not let her pass that side vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side when shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side shoulder beginning by now to be dark with sweat was even with back for a few bounds they moved evenly but before the obstacle they were approaching vronsky began working at the reins anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle and swiftly passed makhotin just upon the declivity he caught a glimpse of his face as he flashed by he even fancied that he smiled vronsky passed makhotin but he was immediately aware of him close upon him and he never ceased hearing just behind him the hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of gladiator 
 the next two obstacles the watercourse and the barrier were easily crossed but vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of gladiator closer upon him he urged on his mare and to his delight felt that she easily quickened her pace and the thud of hoofs was again heard at the same distance away 
 vronsky was at the head of the race just as he wanted to be and as cord had advised and now he felt sure of being the winner his excitement his delight and his tenderness for grew keener and keener he longed to look round but he did not dare do this and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so as to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that gladiator still kept there remained only one obstacle the most difficult if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first he was flying toward the irish barricade and he both together saw the barricade in the distance and both the man and the mare had a hesitation he saw the uncertainty in the ears and lifted the whip but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless the mare knew what was wanted she quickened her pace and rose rhythmically just as he had fancied she would and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush which carried her far beyond the ditch and with the same rhythm without effort with the same leg forward fell back into her pace again 
 bravo vronsky he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were his friends and his regiment comrades who were standing at the obstacle he could not fail to recognize voice though he did not see him 
 o my sweet he said inwardly to as he listened for what was happening behind cleared it he thought catching the thud of hoofs behind him there remained only the last ditch filled with water and two arsheenes wide vronsky did not even look at it but anxious to come in a long way ahead began sawing away at the reins lifting the head and letting it go in time with her paces he felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength not her neck and shoulders merely were wet but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane her head her sharp ears and her breath came in short sharp gasps but he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining two hundred sazhenes it was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace she flew over the ditch as though not noticing it she flew over it like a bird but at the same instant vronsky to his horror felt that failing to keep up with the pace he had he did not know how made an abominable unpardonable move in recovering his seat in the saddle all at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened he could not yet make out what had happened when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him and makhotin passed at a swift gallop vronsky was touching the ground with one foot and his mare was sinking on that foot he just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side gasping painfully and making vain efforts to rise with her delicate soaking neck she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird the clumsy movement made by vronsky had broken her back but that he only knew much later at that moment he knew only that makhotin had flown swiftly by while he stood staggering alone on the muddy motionless ground and lay gasping before him bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eye still unable to realize what had happened vronsky tugged at his reins again she struggled all over like a fish and her shoulders making the wings of the saddle crackle she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back she quivered all over and again fell on her side with his face hideous with passion pale his lower jaw trembling vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein she did not stir but thrusting her nose into the ground she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes 
 groaned vronsky clutching at his head ah what have i done he cried the race lost and my fault shameful unpardonable and the poor darling ruined mare ah what have i done 
 a crowd of men a doctor and his assistant the officers of his regiment ran up to him to his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt the mare had broken her back and it was decided to shoot her vronsky could not answer questions could not speak to anyone he turned and without picking up his fallen cap walked away from the racecourse unconscious of where he was going he felt utterly wretched for the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune misfortune beyond remedy and caused by his own fault 
 iashvin overtook him with his cap and led him home and half an hour later vronsky had regained his but the memory of that race remained for long in his heart the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life

 the external relations of alexei alexandrovich and his wife had remained unchanged the sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever as in former years at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering place for the sake of his health being deranged every year with his strenuous winter work and just as always he returned in july and at once fell to his usual work with increased energy just as always too his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town while he remained in peterburg 
 from the date of their conversation after the party at princess he had never spoken again to anna of his suspicions and his jealousies and that habitual tone of his of bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife he was a little colder to his wife he simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight conversation which she had repelled in his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation but nothing more you would not be open with me he seemed to say mentally addressing her so much the worse for you now you may beg as you please but i be open with you so much the worse for you he said mentally like a man who after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say oh very well then you shall burn for this 
 this man so subtle and astute in official life did not realize all the insanity of such an attitude to his wife he did not realize it because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings toward his family that is his wife and son he who had been such a considerate father had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son and adopted to him just the same bantering tone as he used with his wife aha young man was the greeting with which he met him 
 alexei alexandrovich asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year but he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings toward his wife and son and his thoughts about them which became more terrible the longer they lay there if anyone had had the right to ask alexei alexandrovich what he thought of his behavior the mild and peaceable alexei alexandrovich would have made no answer but he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject it was precisely for this reason that there came into alexei face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his health alexei alexandrovich did not want to think at all about his behavior and feelings and he actually succeeded in not thinking about them at all 
 alexei permanent summer villa was in peterhof and the countess lidia ivanovna used to spend the summer there close to anna and constantly seeing her that year countess lidia ivanovna declined to settle in peterhof did not call once at anna and had hinted to alexei alexandrovich about the unsuitability of close intimacy with betsy and vronsky alexei alexandrovich had sternly cut her short roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion and from that time began to avoid countess lidia ivanovna he did not want to see and did not see that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife he did not want to understand and did not understand why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at tsarskoe where betsy was staying and not far from the camp of regiment he did not allow himself to think about it and he did not think about it but all the same though he never admitted it to himself and had no proofs nor even suspicious evidence at the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband and he was profoundly miserable about it 
 how often during those eight years of happy life with his wife had alexei alexandrovich looked at other faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself how can people descend to that how is it they put an end to such a hideous situation but now when the misfortune had come upon himself he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the situation that he would not recognize it at all would not recognize it just because it was too awful too unnatural 
 since his return from abroad alexei alexandrovich had been twice at their country villa once he dined there another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends but he had not once stayed the night there as it had been his habit to do in previous years 
 the day of the races had been a very busy day for alexei alexandrovich but when sketching out the day in the morning he made up his mind to go immediately after his early dinner to their summer villa to see his wife and from there to the races which all the court were to witness and at which he was bound to be present he was going to see his wife because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances and besides on that day as it was the fifteenth he had to give his wife some money for her expenses according to their usual arrangement 
 with his habitual control over his thoughts though he thought all this about his wife he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her 
 that morning was a very full one for alexei alexandrovich the evening before countess lidia ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in china who was staying in peterburg and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view and likely to be useful alexei alexandrovich had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening and finished it in the morning then people began arriving with petitions and then came the reports interviews appointments dismissals apportionment of rewards pensions payments papers the workday round as alexei alexandrovich called it that always took up so much time then there was a private business of his own a visit from the doctor and from the steward who managed his property the steward did not take up much time he simply gave alexei alexandrovich the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs which was not altogether satisfactory as during that year owing to increased expenses more had been paid out than usual and there was a deficit but the doctor a celebrated peterburg doctor who was an intimate acquaintance of alexei alexandrovich had taken up a great deal of time alexei alexandrovich had not expected him that day and was surprised at his visit and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health listened to his breathing and tapped at his liver alexei alexandrovich did not know that his friend lidia ivanovna noticing that he was not as well as usual that year had begged the doctor to go and examine him do this for my sake the countess lidia ivanovna had said to him 
 i will do it for the sake of russia countess replied the doctor 
 a priceless man said the countess lidia ivanovna 
 the doctor was extremely dissatisfied with alexei alexandrovich he found the liver considerably enlarged and the digestive powers weakened while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect he prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible and as far as possible less mental strain and above all no worry in other words just what was as much out of alexei power as abstaining from breathing then he withdrew leaving in alexei alexandrovich an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him and that there was no chance of curing it 
 as he was coming away the doctor chanced to meet on the steps an acquaintance of his sludin who was head clerk in alexei office they had been comrades at the university and though they rarely met they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends and hence there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin 
 how glad i am been seeing him said sludin not well and i fancy well what do you think of him 
 tell you said the doctor beckoning over head to his coachman to bring the carriage round just this said the doctor taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it if you strain the strings and then try to break them find it a difficult job but strain a string to its very utmost and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it and with his close assiduity his conscientious devotion to his work strained to the utmost and some outside burden weighing on him and that not a light one concluded the doctor raising his eyebrows significantly will you be at the races he added as he came down to his carriage yes yes to be sure it does waste a lot of time the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of he had not caught 
 directly after the doctor who had taken up so much time came the celebrated traveler and alexei alexandrovich by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it 
 at the same time with the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to peterburg with whom alexei alexandrovich had to have some conversation after his departure he had to finish the daily routine of business with his head clerk and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain personage on a matter of grave and serious import alexei alexandrovich hardly managed to be back by five his dinner hour and after dining with his head clerk he invited him to drive with him to his summer villa and to the races 
 though he did not acknowledge it to himself alexei alexandrovich always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interviews with his wife

 alexei permanent summer villa was in peterhof and the countess lidia ivanovna used to spend the summer there close to anna and constantly seeing her that year countess lidia ivanovna declined to settle in peterhof did not call once at anna and had hinted to alexei alexandrovich about the unsuitability of close intimacy with betsy and vronsky alexei alexandrovich had sternly cut her short roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion and from that time began to avoid countess lidia ivanovna he did not want to see and did not see that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife he did not want to understand and did not understand why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at tsarskoe where betsy was staying and not far from the camp of regiment he did not allow himself to think about it and he did not think about it but all the same though he never admitted it to himself and had no proofs nor even suspicious evidence at the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband and he was profoundly miserable about it 
 how often during those eight years of happy life with his wife had alexei alexandrovich looked at other faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself how can people descend to that how is it they put an end to such a hideous situation but now when the misfortune had come upon himself he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the situation that he would not recognize it at all would not recognize it just because it was too awful too unnatural 
 since his return from abroad alexei alexandrovich had been twice at their country villa once he dined there another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends but he had not once stayed the night there as it had been his habit to do in previous years 
 the day of the races had been a very busy day for alexei alexandrovich but when sketching out the day in the morning he made up his mind to go immediately after his early dinner to their summer villa to see his wife and from there to the races which all the court were to witness and at which he was bound to be present he was going to see his wife because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances and besides on that day as it was the fifteenth he had to give his wife some money for her expenses according to their usual arrangement 
 with his habitual control over his thoughts though he thought all this about his wife he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her 
 that morning was a very full one for alexei alexandrovich the evening before countess lidia ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in china who was staying in peterburg and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view and likely to be useful alexei alexandrovich had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening and finished it in the morning then people began arriving with petitions and then came the reports interviews appointments dismissals apportionment of rewards pensions payments papers the workday round as alexei alexandrovich called it that always took up so much time then there was a private business of his own a visit from the doctor and from the steward who managed his property the steward did not take up much time he simply gave alexei alexandrovich the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs which was not altogether satisfactory as during that year owing to increased expenses more had been paid out than usual and there was a deficit but the doctor a celebrated peterburg doctor who was an intimate acquaintance of alexei alexandrovich had taken up a great deal of time alexei alexandrovich had not expected him that day and was surprised at his visit and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health listened to his breathing and tapped at his liver alexei alexandrovich did not know that his friend lidia ivanovna noticing that he was not as well as usual that year had begged the doctor to go and examine him do this for my sake the countess lidia ivanovna had said to him 
 i will do it for the sake of russia countess replied the doctor 
 a priceless man said the countess lidia ivanovna 
 the doctor was extremely dissatisfied with alexei alexandrovich he found the liver considerably enlarged and the digestive powers weakened while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect he prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible and as far as possible less mental strain and above all no worry in other words just what was as much out of alexei power as abstaining from breathing then he withdrew leaving in alexei alexandrovich an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him and that there was no chance of curing it 
 as he was coming away the doctor chanced to meet on the steps an acquaintance of his sludin who was head clerk in alexei office they had been comrades at the university and though they rarely met they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends and hence there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin 
 how glad i am been seeing him said sludin not well and i fancy well what do you think of him 
 tell you said the doctor beckoning over head to his coachman to bring the carriage round just this said the doctor taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it if you strain the strings and then try to break them find it a difficult job but strain a string to its very utmost and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it and with his close assiduity his conscientious devotion to his work strained to the utmost and some outside burden weighing on him and that not a light one concluded the doctor raising his eyebrows significantly will you be at the races he added as he came down to his carriage yes yes to be sure it does waste a lot of time the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of he had not caught 
 directly after the doctor who had taken up so much time came the celebrated traveler and alexei alexandrovich by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it 
 at the same time with the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to peterburg with whom alexei alexandrovich had to have some conversation after his departure he had to finish the daily routine of business with his head clerk and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain personage on a matter of grave and serious import alexei alexandrovich hardly managed to be back by five his dinner hour and after dining with his head clerk he invited him to drive with him to his summer villa and to the races 
 though he did not acknowledge it to himself alexei alexandrovich always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interviews with his wife

 anna was upstairs standing before the looking glass and with assistance pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance 
 too early for betsy she thought and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and protruded from it the black hat of alexei alexandrovich and the ears that she knew so well how unlucky can he be going to stay the night she wondered and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that without dwelling on it for a moment she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she had come to know of late she abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking hardly knowing what she was saying 
 ah how lovely of you she said giving her husband her hand and with a smile greeting sludin who was like one of the family staying the night i hope was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter and now go together only a pity promised betsy coming for me 
 alexei alexandrovich knit his brows at name 
 oh not going to separate the inseparables he said in his usual bantering tone going with mikhail vassilyevich even the doctors order me to walk walk and fancy myself at the springs again 
 no hurry said anna would you like tea 
 she rang 
 bring in tea and tell seriozha that alexei alexandrovich is here well tell me how have you been mikhail vassilyevich not been to see me before look how lovely it is out on the terrace she said turning first to one and then to the other 
 she spoke very simply and naturally but too much and too fast she was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look which mikhail vassilyevich turned on her that he was as it were keeping watch on her 
 mikhail vassilyevich promptly went out on the terrace 
 she sat down beside her husband 
 you look quite well she said 
 yes he said the been with me today and wasted an hour of my time i feel that some one of our friends must have sent him my so precious 
 come what did he say 
 she questioned him about his health and what he had been doing and tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her 
 all this she said brightly rapidly and with a peculiar brilliance in her eyes but alexei alexandrovich did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers he heard only her words and gave them only the direct sense they bore and he answered simply though jestingly there was nothing remarkable in all this conversation but never after could anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame 
 seriozha came in preceded by his governess if alexei alexandrovich had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which seriozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother but he would not see anything and he did not see it 
 ah the young man grown really getting quite a man how are you young man 
 and he gave his hand to the scared child 
 seriozha had been shy of his father before and now ever since alexei alexandrovich had taken to calling him young man and since that insolvable question had occurred to him as to whether vronsky were friend or foe he avoided his father he looked round toward his mother as though seeking refuge it was only with his mother that he was at ease meanwhile alexei alexandrovich was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the governess and seriozha was so miserably uncomfortable that anna saw he was on the point of tears 
 anna who had flushed a little the instant her son had come in noticing that seriozha was uncomfortable got up hurriedly took alexei hand from her shoulder and kissing the boy led him out onto the terrace and quickly came back 
 time to start though said she glancing at her watch how is it betsy come 
 yes said alexei alexandrovich and getting up he folded his hands and cracked his fingers come to bring you some money too for nightingales we know live on fairy tales he said you want it i expect 
 no i yes i do she said without looking at him and crimsoning to the roots of her hair but come back here after the races i suppose 
 oh yes answered alexei alexandrovich and the glory of peterhof princess tverskaia he added looking out of the window at the english harnessed carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high what elegance charming well let us be starting too then 
 princess tverskaia did not get out of her carriage but her liveryman in spatterdashes a cape and black high hat jumped off at the entrance 
 going said anna and kissing her son she went up to alexei alexandrovich and held out her hand to him it was ever so lovely of you to come 
 alexei alexandrovich kissed her hand 
 well au revoir then come back for some tea be delightful she said and went out radiant and gay but as soon as he was out of sight she became aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched and she shuddered with repulsion

 when alexei alexandrovich reached the racecourse anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside betsy in that pavilion where the highest society had gathered she caught sight of her husband in the distance two men her husband and her lover were the two centers of her existence and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their proximity she was aware of her husband approaching a long way off and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving she watched his progress toward the pavilion saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow now exchanging friendly nonchalant greetings with his equals now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world and taking off his big round hat that pressed down the tips of his ears all these ways of his she knew and all were hateful to her nothing but ambition nothing but desire to get on all there is in his soul she thought as for his lofty ideals love of culture religion they are only so many tools for getting on 
 from his glances toward the ladies pavilion he was staring straight at her but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin ribbons feathers parasols and flowers she saw that he was looking for her but she purposely avoided noticing him 
 alexei alexandrovich princess betsy called to him sure you see your wife here she is 
 he smiled his chilly smile 
 so much splendor here that eyes are dazzled he said and he went into the pavilion he smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her and greeted the princess and other acquaintances giving to each what was due that is to say jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men below near the pavilion was standing an adjutant general of whom alexei alexandrovich had a high opinion noted for his intelligence and culture alexei alexandrovich entered into conversation with him 
 there was an interval between the races and so nothing hindered conversation the adjutant general expressed his disapproval of races alexei alexandrovich replied defending them anna heard his high measured tones without losing one word and every word struck her as false and stabbed her ears with pain 
 when the steeplechase was beginning she bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted and at the same time she heard that loathsome voice of her husband she was in an agony of terror for vronsky but a still greater agony was the as it seemed to her stream of her shrill voice with its familiar intonations 
 a wicked woman a lost woman she thought but i like lying i endure falsehood while as for him her husband falsehood is the breath of life to him he knows all about it he sees it all what does he care if he can talk so calmly if he were to kill me if he were to kill vronsky i might respect him no all he wants is falsehood and propriety anna said to herself not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband and how she would have liked to see him behave she did not understand either that alexei peculiar loquacity that day so exasperating to her was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness as a child that has been hurt hops about putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain in the same way alexei alexandrovich needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in and with the continual iteration of his name would force themselves on his attention and it is as natural for a child to hop about as it was natural for him to talk well and cleverly he was saying 
 danger in the races to officers to cavalrymen is an essential element in the race if england can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men sport has in my opinion a great value and as is always the case we see nothing but what is most superficial 
 not superficial said princess tverskaia one of the officers they say has broken two ribs 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled his smile which uncovered his teeth but revealed nothing more 
 admit princess that not superficial he said but internal but not the point and he turned again to the general with whom he talked seriously we forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men who have chosen that career and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side it forms an integral part of the duties of an officer low sports such as prize fighting or spanish bullfights are a sign of barbarity but specialized trials of skill are a sign of development 
 no i come another time too upsetting said princess betsy it anna 
 it is upsetting but one tear oneself away said another lady if been a roman woman i should never have missed a single circus 
 anna said nothing and keeping her opera glass up gazed always at the same spot 
 at that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion breaking off what he was saying alexei alexandrovich got up hurriedly though with dignity and bowed low to the general 
 not racing the officer asked chaffing him 
 my race is a harder one alexei alexandrovich responded deferentially 
 and though the answer meant nothing the general looked as though he had heard a witty remark from a witty man and fully relished la pointe de la sauce 
 there are two aspects alexei alexandrovich resumed those who take part and those who look on and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator i admit but 
 any bets princess sounded stepan voice from below addressing betsy your favorite 
 anna and i are for kuzovlev replied betsy 
 for vronsky a pair of gloves 
 done 
 but it is a pretty sight it 
 alexei alexandrovich paused while the others were talking near him but he began again directly 
 i admit that manly sports do not he made an attempt to continue 
 but at that moment the racers started and all conversation ceased alexei alexandrovich also fell silent and everyone stood up and turned toward the stream alexei alexandrovich took no interest in the race and so he did not watch the racers but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes his eyes rested upon anna 
 her face was white and stern she was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man her hand had convulsively clutched her fan and she held her breath he looked at her and hastily turned away scrutinizing other faces 
 but this lady too and others very much moved as well very natural alexei alexandrovich told himself he tried not to look at her but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her he examined that face again trying not to read what was so plainly written on it and against his own will with horror read in it what he did not want to know 
 the first fall at the stream agitated everyone but alexei alexandrovich saw distinctly on pale triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen when after makhotin and vronsky had cleared the worst barrier the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public alexei alexandrovich saw that anna did not even notice it and had some difficulty in realizing what they were saying around her but more and more often and with greater persistence he watched her anna wholly engrossed as she was with the sight of vronsky racing became aware of her cold eyes fixed upon her from aside 
 she glanced round for an instant looked inquiringly at him and with a slight frown turned away again 
 ah i care she seemed to say to him and she did not once glance at him again 
 the race was an unlucky one and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half had been thrown and hurt toward the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation which was intensified by the fact that the czar was displeased

 chapter 
 
 everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered the lions and gladiators will be the next thing and everyone was feeling horrified so that when vronsky fell to the ground and anna moaned aloud there was nothing very much out of the way in it but afterward a change came over face which really went beyond decorum she utterly lost her head she began fluttering like a caged bird at one moment wanting to get up and move away and at the next turning to betsy 
 let us go let us go she said 
 but betsy did not hear her she was bending down talking to a general who had come up to her 
 alexei alexandrovich went up to anna and courteously offered her his arm 
 let us go if you like he said in french but anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband 
 broken his leg too so they say the general was saying this surpasses everything 
 without answering her husband anna lifted her opera glass and gazed toward the place where vronsky had fallen but it was so far off and there was such a crowd of people about it that she could make out nothing she put down the opera glass and would have moved away but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the czar anna craned forward listening 
 stiva stiva she cried to her brother 
 but her brother did not hear her again she would have moved away 
 once more i offer you my arm if you want to be going said alexei alexandrovich reaching for her hand 
 she drew back from him with aversion and without looking at his face answered 
 no no leave me alone stay 
 she saw now that from the place of accident an officer was running across the course toward the pavilion betsy waved her handkerchief to him the officer brought the news that the rider was not killed but that the back of the horse had been broken 
 on hearing this anna sat down hurriedly and hid her face in her fan alexei alexandrovich saw that she was weeping and could not control her tears nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom alexei alexandrovich stood so as to screen her giving her time to recover herself 
 for the third time i offer you my arm he said to her after a short interval turning to her anna gazed at him and did not know what to say princess betsy came to her rescue 
 no alexei alexandrovich i brought anna and i promised to take her home put in betsy 
 excuse me princess he said smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face but i see that not very well and i wish her to come home with me 
 anna looked about her in a frightened way got up submissively and laid her hand on her arm 
 send to him and find out and let you know betsy whispered to her 
 as they left the pavilion alexei alexandrovich as always talked to those he met and anna had as always to talk and answer but she was utterly beside herself and moved hanging on her arm as though in a dream 
 is he killed or not is it true will he come or not shall i see him today she was thinking 
 she took her seat in her carriage in silence and in silence drove out of the press of carriages in spite of all he had seen alexei alexandrovich still did not allow himself to consider his real condition he merely saw the outward symptoms he saw that she was behaving unbecomingly and considered it his duty to tell her so but it was very difficult for him not to say more to tell her nothing but that he opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved unbecomingly but he could not help saying something utterly different 
 what an inclination we all have though for these cruel spectacles he said i observe 
 eh i understand said anna contemptuously 
 he was offended and at once began to say what he had meant to say 
 i am obliged to tell you he began 
 so now we are to have it out she thought and she felt frightened 
 i am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today he said to her in french 
 in what way has my behavior been unbecoming she said aloud turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face not with the bright expression that seemed covering something but with a look of determination under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she was feeling 
 be careful he said pointing to the open window opposite the coachman 
 he got up and pulled up the window 
 what did you consider unbecoming she repeated 
 the despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders 
 he waited for her to retort but she was silent looking straight before her 
 i have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you there was a time when i spoke of your inward attitude but i am not speaking of that now now i speak only of your external attitude you have behaved improperly and i would wish it not to occur again 
 she did not hear half of what he was saying she felt before him and was thinking whether it was true that vronsky was not killed was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt but that the back of the horse had been broken she merely smiled with a forced smile when he finished and made no reply because she had not heard what he said alexei alexandrovich had begun to speak boldly but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of the dismay she was feeling infected him too he saw the smile and a strange misapprehension came over him 
 she is smiling at my suspicions yes she will tell me directly what she told me before that there is no foundation for my suspicions that the whole thing is absurd 
 at that moment when the revelation of everything was hanging over him there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless so terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe anything but the expression of her face scared and gloomy did not now promise even deception 
 possibly i was mistaken said he if so i beg your pardon 
 no you were not mistaken she said slowly looking desperately into his frigid face you were not mistaken i was in despair nor could i help being in despair i am listening to you but i am thinking of him i love him i am his mistress i bear you afraid of you and i hate you you can do what you like to me 
 and dropping back into the corner of the carriage she broke into sobs hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich did not stir and kept looking straight before him but his whole face suddenly bore the solemn rigidity of the dead and his expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home on reaching the house he turned his head to her still with the same expression 
 very well but i expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time his voice shook as i may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you 
 he got out first and helped her to get out before the servants he pressed her hand took his seat in the carriage and drove back to peterburg 
 immediately afterward a footman came from princess betsy and brought anna a note 
 i sent to alexei to find out how he is and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt but in despair 
 so he will be here she thought what a good thing i told him all 
 she glanced at her watch she had still three hours to wait and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame 
 my god how light it is dreadful but i do love to see his face and i do love this fantastic light my husband oh yes well thank god at an end with him

 everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered the lions and gladiators will be the next thing and everyone was feeling horrified so that when vronsky fell to the ground and anna moaned aloud there was nothing very much out of the way in it but afterward a change came over face which really went beyond decorum she utterly lost her head she began fluttering like a caged bird at one moment wanting to get up and move away and at the next turning to betsy 
 let us go let us go she said 
 but betsy did not hear her she was bending down talking to a general who had come up to her 
 alexei alexandrovich went up to anna and courteously offered her his arm 
 let us go if you like he said in french but anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband 
 broken his leg too so they say the general was saying this surpasses everything 
 without answering her husband anna lifted her opera glass and gazed toward the place where vronsky had fallen but it was so far off and there was such a crowd of people about it that she could make out nothing she put down the opera glass and would have moved away but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the czar anna craned forward listening 
 stiva stiva she cried to her brother 
 but her brother did not hear her again she would have moved away 
 once more i offer you my arm if you want to be going said alexei alexandrovich reaching for her hand 
 she drew back from him with aversion and without looking at his face answered 
 no no leave me alone stay 
 she saw now that from the place of accident an officer was running across the course toward the pavilion betsy waved her handkerchief to him the officer brought the news that the rider was not killed but that the back of the horse had been broken 
 on hearing this anna sat down hurriedly and hid her face in her fan alexei alexandrovich saw that she was weeping and could not control her tears nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom alexei alexandrovich stood so as to screen her giving her time to recover herself 
 for the third time i offer you my arm he said to her after a short interval turning to her anna gazed at him and did not know what to say princess betsy came to her rescue 
 no alexei alexandrovich i brought anna and i promised to take her home put in betsy 
 excuse me princess he said smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face but i see that not very well and i wish her to come home with me 
 anna looked about her in a frightened way got up submissively and laid her hand on her arm 
 send to him and find out and let you know betsy whispered to her 
 as they left the pavilion alexei alexandrovich as always talked to those he met and anna had as always to talk and answer but she was utterly beside herself and moved hanging on her arm as though in a dream

 in the little german watering place to which the shcherbatskys had betaken themselves as in all places indeed where people are gathered together the usual process as it were of the crystallization of society went on assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost definitely and unalterably takes the special form of the crystal of snow so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his or her peculiar place 
 frst shcherbatsky samt gemahlin und tochter by the apartments they took and from their name and from the friends they made were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them 
 there was visiting the watering place that year a real german frstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever princess shcherbatsky wished above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite kitty made a low and graceful curtsy in the very simple that is to say very elegant frock that had been ordered for her from paris the german princess said i hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face and for the shcherbatskyg certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing the shcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady and of a german countess and her son wounded in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister yet inevitably the shcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady marya eugenyevna rtishcheva and her daughter whom kitty disliked because she had fallen ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty had known from childhood and had always seen in uniform and epaulets and who now with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there was no getting rid of him when all this was so firmly established kitty began to be very much bored especially as the prince went off to carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother she took no interest in the people she knew feeling that nothing fresh would come of them her chief mental interest in the watering place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know it was characteristic of kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible especially so in those she did not know and now as she made surmises as to who people were what were their relations to one another and what they were like kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters and found confirmation in her observations 
 of these people the one that attracted her most was a russian girl who had come to the watering place with an invalid russian lady madame stahl as everyone called her madame stahl belonged to the highest society but she was so ill that she could not walk and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage but it was not so much from as from pride so princess shcherbatskaia interpreted it that madame stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there the russian girl looked after madame stahl and besides that she was as kitty observed on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill and there were many of them at the springs and was solicitous over them in the most natural way this russian girl was not as kitty gathered related to madame stahl nor was she a paid attendant madame stahl called her varenka and other people called her mademoiselle varenka apart from the interest kitty took in this relations with madame stahl and with other unknown persons kitty as often happened felt an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her 
 of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth but she was as it were a creature without youth she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty if her features were criticized separately she was handsome rather that plain in spite of the sickly hue of her face hers would have been a good figure too if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head which was too large for her medium height but she was not likely to be attractive to men she was like a fine flower already past its bloom and without fragrance though the petals were still unwithered moreover she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality and the consciousness of her own attractiveness 
 she always seemed absorbed in work beyond a doubt and so it seemed as if she could take no interest in anything outside it it was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the great attraction of mademoiselle varenka kitty felt that in her in her manner of life she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking interest in life a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men which so revolted kitty and appeared to her now as a shameful exhibition of goods in search of a purchaser the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend the more convinced she was that this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance 
 the two girls used to meet several times a day and every time they met eyes said who are you what are you are you really the exquisite creature i imagine you to be but for goodness sake suppose her eyes added that i would force my acquaintance on you i simply admire you and like you i like you too and very very sweet and i should like you better still if i had time answered the eyes of the unknown girl kitty saw indeed that she was always busy either she was taking the children of a russian family home from the springs or fetching a shawl for a sick lady and wrapping her up in it or trying to interest an irritable invalid or selecting and buying teacakes for someone 
 soon after the arrival of the shcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention these were a tall man with a stooping figure and huge hands in an old coat too short for him with black simple and yet terrible eyes and a woman very badly and tastelessly dressed recognizing these persons as russians kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them but the princess having ascertained from the kurliste that this was nikolai levin and marya nikolaevna explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was and all her fancies about these two people vanished not so much from what her mother told her as from the fact that it was brother this pair suddenly seemed to kitty in the highest degree unpleasant this levin with his continual twitching of his head aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust 
 it seemed to her that his big terrible eyes which persistently pursued her expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt and she tried to avoid meeting him

 it was a foul day it had been raining all the morning and the invalids with their parasols had flocked into the arcades 
 kitty was walking there with her mother and the moscow colonel smart and jaunty in his european coat bought at frankfort they were walking on one side of the arcade trying to avoid levin who was walking on the other side varenka in her dark dress in a black hat with a turndown brim was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind frenchwoman and every time she met kitty they exchanged friendly glances 
 mamma i speak to her said kitty watching her unknown friend and noticing that she was going up to the spring and that they might come there together 
 oh if you want to so much find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself answered her mother what do you see in her out of the way a companion most probably if you like make acquaintance with madame stahl i used to know her added the princess lifting her head haughtily 
 kitty knew that the princess was offended because madame stahl had apparently avoided making her acquaintance kitty did not insist 
 how wonderfully sweet she is she said gazing at varenka just as she handed a glass to the frenchwoman look how natural and sweet it all is 
 so funny to see your engouements said the princess no better go back she added noticing levin coming toward them with his companion and a german doctor to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily 
 they turned to go back when suddenly they heard not merely noisy talk but actual shouting levin stopping short was shouting at the doctor and the doctor too was excited a crowd gathered about them the princess and kitty beat a hasty retreat while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was up 
 a few minutes later the colonel overtook them 
 what was it inquired the princess 
 scandalous and disgraceful answered the colonel the one thing to be dreaded is meeting russians abroad that tall gentleman was abusing the doctor flinging all sorts of insults at him because he treating him quite as he liked and he began waving his stick at him simply scandalous 
 oh how unpleasant said the princess well and how did it end 
 luckily at that point that miss the one in the mushroom hat intervened she is a russian lady i think said the colonel 
 mademoiselle varenka kitty asked joyously 
 yes yes she came to the rescue before anyone else she took the man by the arm and led him away 
 there mamma said kitty yet you wonder why enthusiastic about her 
 the next day as she watched her unknown friend kitty noticed that mademoiselle varenka was already on the same terms with levin and his companion as with her other proteges she went up to them entered into conversation with them and served as interpreter for the woman who could not speak any foreign language 
 kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make acquaintance with varenka and disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of madame stahl who thought fit to give herself airs she made inquiries about varenka and having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there could he no harm even if little good in the acquaintance she herself approached varenka and made acquaintance with her 
 choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring while varenka had stopped outside the the princess approached her 
 allow me to make your acquaintance she said with her dignified smile my daughter has lost her heart to you she said possibly you do not know me i am 
 that feeling is more than reciprocal princess varenka answered hurriedly 
 what a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot said the princess 
 varenka flushed a little 
 i remember i think i did anything she said 
 why you saved that levin from disagreeable consequences 
 yes sa compagne called me and i tried to pacify him very ill and was dissatisfied with the doctor used to looking after such invalids 
 yes heard you live at mentone with your aunt i think madame stahl i used to know her 
 no not my aunt i call her maman but i am not related to her i was brought up by her answered varenka flushing a little again 
 this was so simply said and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face that the princess saw why kitty had taken such a fancy to varenka 
 well and this levin going to do asked the princess 
 going away answered varenka 
 at that instant kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight because her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend 
 see kitty your intense desire to make friends with mademoiselle 
 varenka varenka put in smiling what everyone calls me 
 kitty blushed with pleasure and slowly without speaking squeezed her new hand which did not respond to her pressure but lay motionless in her hand the hand did not respond to her pressure but the face of mademoiselle varenka glowed with a soft glad though rather mournful smile that showed large but handsome teeth 
 i have long wished for this too she said 
 but but you are so busy 
 oh no not at all busy answered varenka but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little russian girls children of an invalid ran up to her 
 varenka calling they cried 
 and varenka went after them

 the particulars which the princess had learned in regard to past and her relations with madame stahl were as follows 
 madame stahl of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament when after her separation from her husband she gave birth to her only child the child had died almost immediately and the family of madame stahl knowing her sensibility and fearing the news would kill her had substituted another child a baby born the same night and in the same house in peterburg the daughter of the chief cook of the imperial household this was varenka madame stahl learned later on that varenka was not her own child but she went on bringing her up especially as very soon afterward varenka had not a relation of her own living 
 madame stahl had now been living without a break more than ten years abroad in the south never leaving her couch and some people said that madame stahl had made her social position as a philanthropic highly religious woman other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures which she represented herself to be no one knew what her faith was catholic protestant or orthodox but one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects 
 varenka lived with her all the while abroad and everyone who knew madame stahl knew and liked mademoiselle varenka as everyone called her 
 having learned all these facts the princess found nothing to object to in her intimacy with varenka more especially as breeding and education were of the best she spoke french and english extremely well and what was of the most weight brought a message from madame stahl expressing her regret that she had been prevented by her from making the acquaintance of the princess 
 after getting to know varenka kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend and every day she discovered new virtues in her 
 the princess hearing that varenka had a good voice asked her to come and sing to them in the evening 
 kitty plays and we have a piano not a good one true but you will give us so much pleasure said the princess with her affected smile which kitty disliked particularly just then because she noticed that varenka had no inclination to sing varenka came however in the evening and brought a roll of music with her the princess had invited marya eugenyevna and her daughter and the colonel 
 varenka seemed quite unaffected by the presence of persons whom she did not know and she went directly to the piano she could not accompany herself but she could sing music at sight very well kitty who played well accompanied her 
 you have an extraordinary talent the princess said to her after varenka had sung the first song excellently 
 marya eugenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration 
 look said the colonel looking out of the window what an audience has collected to listen to you 
 there actually was a considerable crowd under the windows 
 i am very glad it gives you pleasure varenka answered simply 
 kitty looked with pride at her friend she was enchanted by her talent and her voice and her face but most of all by her manner by obviously thinking nothing of her singing and being quite unmoved by their praise she seemed only to be asking am i to sing again or is that enough 
 if it had been i thought kitty how proud i should have been how delighted i should have been to see that crowd under the windows but utterly unmoved by it her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please maman what is there about her what is it gives her the power to look down on everything to be calm independently of everything how i should like to know it and to learn it from her thought kitty gazing into her serene face the princess asked varenka to sing again and varenka sang another song also smoothly distinctly and well standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin hand 
 the next song in the book was an italian one kitty played the opening bars and looked round at varenka 
 skip that said varenka flushing a little 
 kitty let her eyes rest on face with a look of dismay and inquiry 
 very well the next one she said hurriedly turning over the pages and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song 
 no answered varenka with a smile laying her hand on the music no have that one and she sang it just as quietly as coolly and as well as the others 
 when she had finished they all thanked her again and went off to tea kitty and varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house 
 am i right that you have some reminiscences connected with that song said kitty tell me she added hastily only say if right 
 no why not tell you said varenka simply and without waiting for a reply she went on yes it brings up memories once painful ones i cared for someone once and i used to sing him that song 
 kitty with big eyes gazed silently sympathetically at varenka 
 i cared for him and he cared for me but his mother was opposed and he married another girl living now not far from us and i see him sometimes you think i had a love story too she said and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which kitty felt must once have glowed all over her 
 i think so why if i were a man i could never care for anyone else after knowing you only i understand how he could to please his mother forget you and make you unhappy he had no heart 
 oh no a very good man and not unhappy quite the contrary very happy well we be singing any more now she added turning toward the house 
 how good you are how good you are cried kitty and stopping her she kissed her if i could only be even a little like you 
 why should you be like anyone lovely as you are said varenka smiling her gentle weary smile 
 no not lovely at all come tell me stop a minute sit down said kitty making her sit down again beside her tell me it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love that he cared for it 
 but he disdain it i believe he cared for me but he was a dutiful son 
 yes but if it been on account of his mother if it had been his own doing said kitty feeling she was giving away her secret and that her face burning with the flush of shame had betrayed her already 
 in that case he would have done wrong and i should not have regretted him answered varenka evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her but of kitty 
 but the humiliation said kitty the humiliation one can never forget never she said remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music 
 where is the humiliation why you did nothing wrong 
 worse than wrong shameful 
 varenka shook her head and laid her hand on 
 why shameful about it she said you tell a man who care for you that you loved him did you 
 of course not i never said a word but he knew it no no there are looks there are ways i forget it if i live a hundred years 
 why so i understand the whole point is whether you love him now or not said varenka who called everything by its name 
 i hate him i forgive myself 
 why what for 
 the shame the humiliation 
 oh if everyone were as sensitive as you are said varenka there a girl who been through the same and all so unimportant 
 why what is important said kitty looking into her face with inquisitive wonder 
 oh so much important said varenka smiling 
 why what 
 oh so much more important answered varenka not knowing what to say but at that instant they heard the voice from the window kitty cold either get a shawl or come indoors 
 it really is time to go in said varenka getting up i have to go on to madame she asked me to 
 kitty held her by the hand and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her what is it what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquility you know tell me but varenka did not even know what eyes were asking her she merely thought that she had to go to see madame berthe too that evening and to make haste home in time for tea at twelve she went indoors collected her music and saying to everyone was about to go 
 allow me to see you home said the colonel 
 yes how can you go alone at night like this chimed in the princess anyway send parasha 
 kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort 
 no i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me she said taking her hat and kissing kitty once more without saying what was important she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her that calm and dignity so much to be envied

 kitty made the acquaintance of madame stahl too and this acquaintance together with her friendship with varenka did not merely exercise a great influence on her it also comforted her in her mental distress she found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance a world having nothing in common with her past an exalted noble world from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly it was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life this life was disclosed in religion but a religion having nothing in common with that one which kitty had known from childhood and which found expression in masses and evening services at the home where one might meet friends and in learning by heart slavonic texts with the priest this was a lofty mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings which one could not merely believe because one was told to believe but which one could love 
 kitty found all this out not from words madame stahl talked to kitty as to a charming child that one regards with pleasure as one regards the memory of youth and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith and that in the sight of compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately talked of other things but in every gesture of madame stahl in every word in every heavenly as kitty called it look and above all in the whole story of her life which she heard from varenka kitty recognized that something that was important of which till then she had known nothing 
 yet elevated as madame character was touching as was her story and exalted and moving as was her speech kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her she noticed that when questioning her about her family madame stahl had smiled contemptuously which was not in accord with christian meekness kitty noticed too that when she had found a catholic priest with her madame stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp shade and had smiled in a peculiar way trivial as these two observations were they perplexed her and she had her doubts as to madame stahl but on the other hand varenka alone in the world without friends or relations with a melancholy disappointment in the past desiring nothing regretting nothing was just that perfection of which kitty dared hardly dream in varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others and one will be calm happy and good and that was what kitty longed to be seeing now clearly what was most important kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her from accounts of the doings of madame stahl and other people whom she mentioned kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life she would like madame niece aline of whom varenka had talked to her a great deal seek out those who were in trouble wherever she might be living help them as far as she could giving them the gospel she would read the gospel to the sick to the criminals to the dying the idea of reading the gospel to criminals as aline did particularly fascinated kitty but all these were secret dreams of which kitty did not talk either to her mother or to varenka 
 while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale however kitty even then at the springs where there were so many people ill and unhappy readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of varenka 
 at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the influence of her engouement as she called it for madame stahl and still more for varenka she saw that kitty did not merely imitate varenka in her conduct but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking of talking of blinking her eyes but later on the princess noticed that apart from this adoration some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter 
 the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that madame stahl had given her a thing she had never done before that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under protection and especially one poor family that of a sick painter petrov kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family all this was well enough and the princess had nothing to say against it especially as wife was a perfectly respectable woman and that the german princess noticing devotion praised her calling her an angel of consolation all this would have been very well if there had been no exaggeration but the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes and so indeed she told her 
 il ne faut jamais rien outrer she said to her 
 her daughter made her no reply but in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity was concerned what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten and give shirt if coat were taken but the princess disliked this exaggeration and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother she concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother but simply because she was her mother she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother 
 how is it anna not been to see us for so long the princess said one day referring to madame petrov asked her but she seems put out about something 
 no not noticed it maman said kitty flushing hotly 
 is it long since been to see them 
 we intend making an excursion to the mountains tomorrow answered kitty 
 well you may go answered the princess gazing at her embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment 
 that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the excursion for the morrow and the princess noticed again that kitty reddened 
 kitty you had some misunderstanding with the petrovs said the princess when they were left alone why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us 
 kitty answered that nothing had happened between them and that she could not tell why anna pavlovna seemed displeased with her kitty answered perfectly truthfully she did not know the reason anna pavlovna had changed toward her but she guessed it she guessed at something which she could not tell her mother which she did not put into words to herself it was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken 
 again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family she remembered the simple delight expressed on the round face of anna pavlovna at their meetings she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him and to get him out of doors the devotion of the youngest boy who used to call her my kitty and would not go to bed without her how lovely it all was then she recalled the thin terribly thin figure of petrov with his long neck in his brown coat his scant curly hair his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to kitty at first and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence she recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him as for all consumptive people and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him she recalled the timid softened look with which he gazed at her and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness and later of a sense of her own goodness which she had felt at it how lovely it all was but all that was at first now a few days ago everything was suddenly spoiled anna pavlovna had met kitty with affected cordiality and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband 
 could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of anna coolness 
 yes she mused there was something unnatural about anna pavlovna and utterly unlike her good nature when she said angrily the day before yesterday there he will keep waiting for you he drink his coffee without you though grown so dreadfully weak 
 yes perhaps too she like it when i gave him the rug it was all so simple but he took it so awkwardly and was so long thanking me that i felt awkward too and then that portrait of me he did so well and most of all that look of confusion and tenderness yes yes it kitty repeated to herself with horror no it be it to be so much to be pitied she said to herself directly after

 chapter 
 
 before the end of the water cure prince shcherbatsky who had gone on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to russian friends to get a breath of russian atmosphere as he said came back to his wife and daughter 
 the views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed the princess thought everything delightful and in spite of her established position in russian society she tried abroad to be like a european fashionable lady which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical russian gentlewoman and so she was affected which did not altogether suit her the prince on the contrary thought everything foreign detestable got sick of european life kept to his russian habits and purposely tried to show himself abroad less european than he was in reality 
 the prince returned thinner with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks but in the most cheerful frame of mind his good humor was even greater when he saw kitty completely recovered the news of friendship with madame stahl and varenka and the reports the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him but this unpleasant news was all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him and more so than ever since his course of carlsbad waters 
 the day after his arrival the prince in his long overcoat with his russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor 
 it was a lovely morning the tidy cheerful houses with their little gardens the sight of the german waitresses working away merrily and bright sun did heart good but the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous german life kitty was no longer struck by this contrast the bright sun the brilliant green of the foliage the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence for which she watched but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june morning and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion and above all the appearance of the robust waitresses seemed something unseemly and monstrous in conjunction with these slowly moving cadavers gathered together from all parts of europe 
 in spite of his feeling of pride and as it were of the return of youth when he walked with his favorite daughter on his arm he felt awkward and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy stout and fat limbs he felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd 
 present present me to your new friends he said to his daughter squeezing her hand with his elbow i like even your horrid soden for making you so well again only melancholy very melancholy here that 
 kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met of some with whom she was acquainted and some with whom she was not at the very entrance of the garden they met the blind lady madame berthe with her guide and the prince was delighted to see the old face light up when she heard voice she at once began talking to him with the exaggerated politeness of the french applauding him for having such a delightful daughter extolling kitty to the skies before her face and calling her a treasure a pearl and a consoling angel 
 well the second angel then said the prince smiling she calls mademoiselle varenka angel number one 
 oh mademoiselle varenka a real angel allez madame berthe assented 
 in the arcade they met varenka herself she was walking rapidly toward them carrying an elegant red bag 
 here is papa come kitty said to her 
 varenka made simply and naturally as she did everything a movement between a bow and curtsy and immediately began talking to the prince without shyness naturally as she talked to everyone 
 of course i know you i know you very well the prince said to her with a smile in which kitty detected with joy that her father liked her friend where are you off to in such haste 
 here she said turning to kitty she has not slept all night and the doctor advised her to go out taking her her work 
 so angel number one said the prince when varenka had gone on 
 kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of varenka but that he could not do it because he liked her 
 come so we shall see all your friends he went on even madame stahl if she deigns to recognize me 
 why did you know her papa kitty asked apprehensively catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the eyes at the mention of madame stahl 
 i used to know her husband and her too a little before joined the pietists 
 what is a pietist papa asked kitty dismayed to find that what she prized so highly in madame stahl had a name 
 i quite know myself i only know that she thanks god for everything for every misfortune and thanks god too that her husband died and rather droll as they get on together that what a piteous face he asked noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long fleshless legs this man lifted his straw hat showed his scanty curly hair and high forehead painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat 
 petrov an artist answered kitty blushing and his wife she added indicating anna pavlovna who as though on purpose at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path 
 poor fellow and what a fine face he has said the prince why you go up to him he wanted to speak to you 
 well let us go then said kitty turning round resolutely how are you feeling today she asked petrov 
 petrov got up leaning on his stick and looked shyly at the prince 
 this is my daughter said the prince let me introduce myself 
 the painter bowed and smiled showing his strangely dazzling white teeth 
 we expected you yesterday princess he said to kitty 
 he staggered as he said this and then repeated the motion trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional 
 i meant to come but varenka said that anna pavlovna sent word you were not going 
 not going said petrov blushing and immediately beginning to cough and his eyes sought his wife aneta aneta he said loudly and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck 
 anna pavlovna came up 
 so you sent word to the princess that we going he whispered to her angrily losing his voice 
 good morning princess said anna pavlovna with an assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner very glad to make your acquaintance she said to the prince long been expected prince 
 why did you send word to the princess that we going the artist whispered hoarsely again still more angrily obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to 
 oh mercy on us i thought we going his wife answered crossly 
 what when he coughed and waved his hand 
 the prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter 
 ah ah he sighed deeply oh poor things 
 yes papa answered kitty and you must know three children no servant and scarcely any means he gets something from the academy she went on briskly trying to drown the distress that queer change in anna manner toward her had aroused in her oh madame stahl said kitty indicating an invalid carriage where propped on pillows something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade this was madame stahl behind her stood the gloomy robust german workman who pushed the carriage close by was standing a swedish count whom kitty knew by name several invalids were lingering near the low carriage staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity 
 the prince walked up to her and kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his eyes he walked up to madame stahl and addressed her with extreme courtesy and charm in that excellent french which so few speak nowadays 
 i know if you remember me but i must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter he said taking off his hat and not putting it on again 
 prince alexandre shcherbatsky said madame stahl lifting upon him her heavenly eyes in which kitty discerned a look of annoyance delighted i have taken a great fancy to your daughter 
 you are still in weak health 
 yes used to it said madame stahl and she introduced the prince to the swedish count 
 you are scarcely changed at all the prince said to her ten or eleven years since i had the honor of seeing you 
 yes god sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it often one wonders what is the goal of this life the other side she said angrily to varenka who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her satisfaction 
 to do good probably said the prince with a twinkle in his eye 
 that is not for us to judge said madame stahl perceiving the shade of expression on the face so you will send me that book dear count very grateful to you she said to the young swede 
 ah cried the prince catching sight of the moscow colonel standing near and with a bow to madame stahl he walked away with his daughter and the moscow colonel who joined them 
 our aristocracy prince the moscow colonel said with ironical intention he cherished a grudge against madame stahl for not making his acquaintance 
 the same as ever replied the prince 
 did you know her before her illness prince to say before she took to her bed 
 yes she took to her bed before my eyes said the prince 
 they say ten years since she has stood on her feet 
 she stand up because her legs are too short she has a very bad figure 
 papa not possible cried kitty 
 what wicked tongues say my darling and your varenka is to endure still he added oh these invalid ladies 
 oh no papa kitty objected warmly varenka worships her and then she does so much good ask anyone everyone knows her and aline stahl 
 perhaps so said the prince squeezing her hand with his elbow but better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows 
 kitty did not answer not because she had nothing to say but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father but strange to say although she had made up her mind so firmly not to be influenced by her views not to let him into her inmost sanctuary she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl which she had carried for a whole month in her heart had vanished never to return just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some fallen garment all that was left was a woman with short legs who lay down because she had a bad figure and worried patient varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking and by no effort of her imagination could kitty bring back the former madame stahl

 chapter 
 
 before the end of the water cure prince shcherbatsky who had gone on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to russian friends to get a breath of russian atmosphere as he said came back to his wife and daughter 
 the views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed the princess thought everything delightful and in spite of her established position in russian society she tried abroad to be like a european fashionable lady which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical russian gentlewoman and so she was affected which did not altogether suit her the prince on the contrary thought everything foreign detestable got sick of european life kept to his russian habits and purposely tried to show himself abroad less european than he was in reality 
 the prince returned thinner with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks but in the most cheerful frame of mind his good humor was even greater when he saw kitty completely recovered the news of friendship with madame stahl and varenka and the reports the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him but this unpleasant news was all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him and more so than ever since his course of carlsbad waters 
 the day after his arrival the prince in his long overcoat with his russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor 
 it was a lovely morning the tidy cheerful houses with their little gardens the sight of the german waitresses working away merrily and bright sun did heart good but the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous german life kitty was no longer struck by this contrast the bright sun the brilliant green of the foliage the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence for which she watched but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june morning and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion and above all the appearance of the robust waitresses seemed something unseemly and monstrous in conjunction with these slowly moving cadavers gathered together from all parts of europe 
 in spite of his feeling of pride and as it were of the return of youth when he walked with his favorite daughter on his arm he felt awkward and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy stout and fat limbs he felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd 
 present present me to your new friends he said to his daughter squeezing her hand with his elbow i like even your horrid soden for making you so well again only melancholy very melancholy here that

 the prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his friends and even to the german landlord in whose rooms the shcherbatskys were staying 
 on coming back with kitty from the springs the prince who had asked the colonel and marya eugenyevna and varenka all to come and have coffee with them gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the tiny garden under the chestnut tree and lunch to be laid there the landlord and the servants too grew brisker under the influence of his good spirits they knew his openhandedness and half an hour later the invalid doctor from hamburg who lived on the top floor looked enviously out of his window at the merry party of healthy russians assembled under the chestnut tree in the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves at a table covered with a white cloth and set with coffeepot bread butter cheese and cold game sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons distributing cups and sandwiches at the other end sat the prince eating heartily and talking loudly and merrily the prince had spread out near him his purchases carved boxes and knickknacks and paper knives of all sorts of which he had bought a heap at every watering place and bestowed them upon everyone including lieschen the servant girl and the landlord with whom he jested in his comically bad german assuring him that it was not the water had cured kitty but his splendid cookery especially his plum soup the princess laughed at her husband for his russian ways but she was more lively and than she had been all the while she had been at the waters the colonel smiled as he always did at the jokes but as far as regards europe of which he believed himself to be making a careful study he took the side the goodhearted marya eugenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said and his jokes made varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter which was something kitty had never seen before 
 kitty was glad of all this but she could not be lighthearted she could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his view of her friends and of the life that had so attracted her to this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the petrovs which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning everyone was but kitty could not feel and this increased her distress she felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood when she had been shut in her room as a punishment and had heard her sisters merry laughter outside 
 well but what did you buy this mass of things for said the princess smiling and handing her husband a cup of coffee 
 one goes for a walk one looks in a shop and they ask you to buy erlaucht excellenz durchlaucht directly they say durchlaucht i hold out and ten thalers are gone 
 simply from boredom said the princess 
 of course it is such boredom my dear that one know what to do with oneself 
 how can you be bored prince so much interesting now in germany said marya eugenyevna 
 but i know everything interesting the plum soup i know and the pea sausages i know i know everything 
 no you may say what you like prince the interest of their institutions said the colonel 
 but what is there interesting all as beaming with joy as brass halfpence conquered everybody and why am i to be pleased at that i conquered anyone only i have myself to take off my own boots and besides to expose them before the door in the morning get up and dress at once and go to the coffeeroom to drink bad tea how different it is at home you get up in no haste you get cross grumble a little and come round again time to think things over and no hurry 
 but money you forget that said the colonel 
 time indeed why there are times one would give a month of for half a rouble and times you give half an hour of for any money that so katenka what is it why are you so depressed 
 not depressed 
 where are you off to stay a little longer he said to varenka 
 i must be going home said varenka getting up and again she broke out laughing when she had recovered she said and went into the house to get her hat 
 kitty followed her even varenka struck her as different she was not inferior but different from what she had fancied her before 
 oh dear a long while since laughed so much said varenka gathering up her parasol and her handbag what a dear your father is 
 kitty did not speak 
 when shall i see you again asked varenka 
 maman meant to go and see the petrovs you be there said kitty to try varenka 
 yes answered varenka getting ready to go away so i promised to help them pack 
 well come too then 
 no why should you 
 why not why not why not said kitty opening her eyes wide and clutching at parasol so as not to let her go no wait a minute why not 
 oh nothing your father has come and besides they will feel awkward at your helping 
 no tell me why you want me to be often at the petrovs you want me to why not 
 i say that said varenka quietly 
 no please tell me 
 tell you everything asked varenka 
 everything everything kitty assented 
 well really nothing of any consequence only that mikhail alexeievich that was the name had meant to leave earlier and now he want to go away said varenka smiling 
 go on go on kitty urged impatiently looking somberly at varenka 
 well and for some reason anna pavlovna told him that he want to go because you are here of course that was nonsense but there was a dispute over it over you you know how irritable these sick people are 
 kitty scowling more than ever kept silent and varenka went on speaking alone trying to soften or soothe her and seeing a storm coming she did not know whether of tears or of words 
 so better not go you understand you be offended 
 and it serves me right and it serves me right kitty cried quickly snatching the parasol out of hand and avoiding looking at her face 
 varenka felt inclined to smile looking at her childish fury but she was afraid of wounding her 
 how does it serve you right i understand she said 
 it serves me right because it was all sham because it was all done on purpose and not from the heart what business had i to interfere with outsiders and so come about that the cause of a quarrel and that done what nobody asked me to do because it was all a sham a sham a sham 
 a sham with what object said varenka gently 
 oh so idiotic so hateful there was no need whatever for me nothing but sham she said opening and shutting the parasol 
 but with what object 
 to seem better to people to myself to god to deceive everyone no now i descend to that one could be bad but anyway not a liar not a cheat 
 but who is a cheat said varenka reproachfully you speak as if 
 but kitty was in one of her gusts of fury and she would not let her finish 
 i talk about you not about you at all perfection yes yes i know all perfection but what am i to do if bad this would never have been if i bad so let me be what i am but not to be a sham what have i to do with anna pavlovna let them go their way and me go mine i be different and yet not that not that 
 what is it asked varenka in bewilderment 
 everything i act except from the heart and you act from principle i simply liked you but you most likely only wanted to save me to improve me 
 you are unjust said varenka 
 but not speaking of other people speaking of myself 
 kitty they heard her voice come here show papa your necklace 
 kitty with a haughty air without making peace with her friend took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother 
 the matter why are you so red her mother and father said to her with one voice 
 nothing she answered be back directly and she ran back 
 still here she thought what am i to say to her oh dear what have i done what have i said why was i rude to her what am i to do what am i to say to her thought kitty and she stopped in the doorway 
 varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at a table examining the parasol spring which kitty had broken she lifted her head 
 varenka forgive me do forgive me whispered kitty going up to her i remember what i said i 
 i really mean to hurt you said varenka smiling 
 peace was made but with her coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for kitty she did not give up everything she had learned but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be her eyes were it seemed opened she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount moreover she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow of sick and dying people in which she had been living the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air to russia to ergushovo where as she knew from letters her sister dolly had already gone with her children 
 but her affection for varenka did not wane parting kitty begged her to come to them in russia 
 come when you get married said varenka 
 i shall never marry 
 well then i shall never come 
 well then i shall be married simply for that mind now remember your promise said kitty 
 the prediction was fulfilled kitty returned home to russia cured she was not as gay and thoughtless as before but she was serene her moscow troubles had become a memory to her

 varenka forgive me do forgive me whispered kitty going up to her i remember what i said i 
 i really mean to hurt you said varenka smiling 
 peace was made but with her coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for kitty she did not give up everything she had learned but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be her eyes were it seemed opened she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount moreover she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow of sick and dying people in which she had been living the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air to russia to ergushovo where as she knew from letters her sister dolly had already gone with her children 
 but her affection for varenka did not wane parting kitty begged her to come to them in russia 
 come when you get married said varenka 
 i shall never marry 
 well then i shall never come 
 well then i shall be married simply for that mind now remember your promise said kitty 
 the prediction was fulfilled kitty returned home to russia cured she was not as gay and thoughtless as before but she was serene her moscow troubles had become a memory to her

 the lowest depths 
 there disinterestedness vanishes 
 the demon is vaguely outlined each one is for himself 
 the i in the eyes howls seeks fumbles and gnaws 
 the social ugolino is in this gulf 
 the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires they are almost unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration 
 they have two mothers both ignorance and misery 
 they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfaction appetite 
 they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger 
 from suffering these spectres pass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy creation logic of darkness that which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest of matter man there becomes a dragon 
 to be hungry to be is the point of departure to be is the point reached from that vault lacenaire emerges 
 we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical excavation 
 there as we have just said all is pure noble dignified honest 
 there assuredly one might be misled but error is worthy of veneration there so thoroughly does it imply heroism 
 the work there effected taken as a whole has a name 
 progress 
 the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths hideous depths 
 there exists beneath society we insist upon this point and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated the great cavern of evil 
 this cavern is below all and is the foe of all 
 it is hatred without exception 
 this cavern knows no philosophers its dagger has never cut a pen 
 its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand 
 never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper 
 babeuf is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to schinderhannes 
 this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything 
 of everything 
 including the upper superior mines which it execrates it not only undermines in its hideous swarming the actual social order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it undermines civilization it undermines revolution it undermines progress its name is simply theft prostitution murder assassination it is darkness and it desires chaos 
 its vault is formed of ignorance 
 all the others those above it have but one suppress it it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by their contemplation of the absolute 
 destroy the cavern ignorance and you destroy the lair crime 
 let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written the only social peril is darkness 
 humanity is identity 
 all men are made of the same clay there is no difference here below at least in predestination the same shadow in front the same flesh in the present the same ashes afterwards 
 but ignorance mingled with the human paste blackens it 
 this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil

 chapter x 
 
 after her funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was asking for orders about their departure this was before his talk with dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace 
 the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward she lay on the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which had shown itself during her illness she wished to pray but did not dare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god she lay for a long time in that position 
 the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays shone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped unconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got up and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening 
 yes you can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one will hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill 
 someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides is it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she thought 
 princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking of the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice 
 your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot think of yourself but with my love for you i must do so has alpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked 
 princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go or where to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it not all the same she thought and did not reply 
 you know chere marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are in danger are surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move now if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knows 
 princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about 
 oh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatych did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing nothing and want to 
 spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow but i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle bourienne because you will agree chere marie to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible 
 mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not printed on ordinary russian paper of general telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford them proper protection she handed this to the princess 
 i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued and and am sure that all due respect would be shown you 
 princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs 
 from whom did you get this she asked 
 they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing 
 princess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince study 
 dunyasha send alpatych or dronushka or somebody to me she said and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing mademoiselle voice we must go at once at once she said appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french 
 if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general rameau for protection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they the french would settle in this house m le general rameau would occupy prince study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of bogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor the soldiers would violate my newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow thought princess mary not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother for herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince study trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered her position 
 the demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by her death all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown force and took possession of her 
 agitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael ivanovich and now for tikhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the other maids could not say in how far mademoiselle statement was correct alpatych was not at home he had gone to the police neither could the architect michael ivanovich who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own he now replied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be got from his answers the old valet tikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princess questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her 
 at length dron the village elder entered the room and with a deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost 
 princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him 
 dronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her dronushka now since our misfortune she began but could not go on 
 we are all in hands said he with a sigh 
 they were silent for a while 
 dronushka alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn to is true as they tell me that i even go away 
 why you go away your excellency you can go said dron 
 i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy dear friend i can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning 
 dron paused he looked askance at princess mary and said there are no horses i told yakov alpatych so 
 why are there none asked the princess 
 all scourge said dron what horses we had have been taken for the army or have died this is such a year not a case of feeding horses we may die of hunger ourselves as it is some go three days without eating nothing been ruined 
 princess mary listened attentively to what he told her 
 the peasants are ruined they have no bread she asked 
 dying of hunger said dron not a case of carting 
 but why you tell me dronushka it possible to help them do all i can 
 to princess mary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the rich could refrain from helping the poor she had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as corn which was sometimes given to the peasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give she was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the peasants needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord 
 but we have grain belonging to my brother she said 
 the grain is all safe replied dron proudly our prince did not order it to be sold 
 give it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you leave in my name said she 
 dron made no answer but sighed deeply 
 give them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all i give this order in my name and tell them that what is ours is theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so 
 dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking 
 discharge me little mother for sake order the keys to be taken from me said he i have served years and have done no wrong discharge me for sake 
 princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants

 babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse 
 a quartette of ruffians claquesous gueulemer babet and montparnasse governed the third lower floor of paris from to 
 gueulemer was a hercules of no defined position 
 for his lair he had the sewer of the he was six feet high his pectoral muscles were of marble his biceps of brass his breath was that of a cavern his torso that of a colossus his head that of a bird 
 one thought one beheld the farnese hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat 
 gueulemer built after this sculptural fashion might have subdued monsters he had found it more expeditious to be one 
 a low brow large temples less than forty years of age but with harsh short hair cheeks like a brush a beard like that of a wild boar the reader can see the man before him his muscles called for work his stupidity would have none of it he was a great idle force 
 he was an assassin through coolness he was thought to be a creole 
 he had probably somewhat to do with marshal brune having been a porter at avignon in after this stage he had turned ruffian 
 the diaphaneity of babet contrasted with the grossness of gueulemer babet was thin and learned 
 he was transparent but impenetrable daylight was visible through his bones but nothing through his eyes he declared that he was a chemist 
 he had been a jack of all trades he had played in vaudeville at he was a man of purpose a fine talker who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures his occupation consisted in selling in the open air plaster busts and portraits of the head of the state 
 in addition to this he extracted teeth 
 he had exhibited phenomena at fairs and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster babet dental artist member of the academies makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids extracts teeth undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners 
 price 
 one tooth one franc fifty centimes two teeth two francs three teeth two francs fifty 
 take advantage of this opportunity this take advantage of this opportunity meant 
 have as many teeth extracted as possible 
 he had been married and had had children he did not know what had become of his wife and children 
 he had lost them as one loses his handkerchief 
 babet read the papers a striking exception in the world to which he belonged 
 one day at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels he had read in the messager that a woman had just given birth to a child who was doing well and had a muzzle and he exclaimed a fortune my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that 
 later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris this was his expression 
 who was claquesous 
 he was night 
 he waited until the sky was daubed with black before he showed himself 
 at nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight 
 where was this hole no one knew 
 he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness and with his back turned to them 
 was his name claquesous certainly not 
 if a candle was brought he put on a mask he was a ventriloquist 
 babet said 
 claquesous is a nocturne for two voices 
 claquesous was vague terrible and a roamer no one was sure whether he had a name claquesous being a sobriquet none was sure that he had a voice as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he had a face as he was never seen without his mask 
 he disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though he sprang from the earth 
 a lugubrious being was montparnasse 
 montparnasse was a child less than twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like cherries charming black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all vices and aspired to all crimes 
 the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse 
 it was the street boy turned pickpocket and a pickpocket turned garroter he was genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious the rim of his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft of hair after the style of 
 he lived by robbery with violence 
 his coat was of the best cut but threadbare montparnasse was a in misery and given to the commission of murders 
 the cause of all this crimes was the desire to be the first grisette who had said to him you are handsome had cast the stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel 
 finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant 
 now the height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime 
 few prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse 
 at eighteen he had already numerous corpses in his past 
 more than one lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a pool of blood curled pomaded with laced waist the hips of a woman the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him his cravat knowingly tied a bludgeon in his pocket a flower in his buttonhole such was this dandy of the sepulchre

 an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess order and wished to have word with their mistress 
 but i never told them to come said princess mary i only told dron to let them have the grain 
 only for sake princess dear have them sent away and go out to them all a trick said dunyasha and when yakov alpatych returns let us get away and please 
 what is a trick asked princess mary in surprise 
 i know it is only listen to me for sake ask nurse too they say they agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered 
 making some mistake i never ordered them to go away said princess mary call dronushka 
 dron came and confirmed words the peasants had come by the princess order 
 but i never sent for them declared the princess you must have given my message wrong i only said that you were to give them the grain 
 dron only sighed in reply 
 if you order it they will go away said he 
 no no go out to them said princess mary and in spite of the and protests she went out into the porch dron dunyasha the nurse and michael ivanovich following her 
 they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the french thought princess mary i will offer them monthly rations and housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in my place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn 
 the men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off their hats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt came close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on her and there were so many different faces that she could not distinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all at once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldly began her speech 
 i am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i shall grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving you everything my friends and i beg you to take everything all our grain so that you may not suffer want and if you have been told that i am giving you the grain to keep you here that is not true on the contrary i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near moscow and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for nothing you shall be given food and lodging 
 the princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd 
 i am not doing this on my own account she continued i do it in the name of my dead father who was a good master to you and of my brother and his son 
 again she paused no one broke the silence 
 ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together all that is mine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her 
 all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she could not fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude or apprehension and distrust but the expression on all the faces was identical 
 we are all very thankful for your bounty but it do for us to take the grain said a voice at the back of the crowd 
 but why not asked the princess 
 no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped 
 but why you want to take it she asked again 
 no one answered 
 the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch eye 
 why you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick if you think something more is wanted tell me i will do anything said she catching his eye 
 but as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered 
 why should we agree we want the grain 
 why should we give up everything we agree agree we are sorry for you but not willing go away yourself alone came from various sides of the crowd 
 and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude but of angry resolve 
 but you have understood me said princess mary with a sad smile why you want to go i promise to house and feed you while here the enemy would ruin you 
 but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd 
 not willing let them ruin us we take your grain we agree 
 again princess mary tried to catch eye but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid her look she felt strange and awkward 
 oh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your houses and go into bondage i dare say give you grain indeed she says voices in the crowd were heard saying 
 with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the house having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts

 these four ruffians formed a sort of proteus winding like a serpent among the police and striving to escape indiscreet glances under divers forms tree flame fountain lending each other their names and their traps hiding in their own shadows boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other stripping off their personalities as one removes his false nose at a masked ball sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that himself took them for a whole throng 
 these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads operating on a grand scale on paris they were that monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society 
 thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their relations babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the seine 
 the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed 
 they furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery 
 they labored at the stage setting 
 they were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were sufficiently lucrative when a crime was in quest of arms they their accomplices they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies 
 they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere 
 there they held their conferences 
 they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly 
 was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day signifies the morning the same as entre chien et dog and the evening 
 this appellation was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians 
 these four men were known under this title when the president of the assizes visited lacenaire in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which lacenaire denied who did it demanded the president 
 lacenaire made this response enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police 
 perhaps it was 
 a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it 
 here are the appellations to which the principal members of the names have survived in special memoirs 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille 
 brujon 
 there was a brujon dynasty we cannot refrain from interpolating this word 
 boulatruelle the already introduced 
 laveuve 
 finistere 
 a negro 
 mardisoir 
 tuesday evening 
 depeche 
 make haste 
 fauntleroy alias bouquetiere the flower girl 
 glorieux a discharged convict 
 barrecarrosse called monsieur dupont 
 
 poussagrive 
 carmagnolet 
 kruideniers called bizarro 
 mangedentelle 
 
 feet in the air 
 called 
 etc etc 
 we pass over some and not the worst of them 
 these names have faces attached 
 they do not express merely beings but species each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization 
 those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets fatigued by the wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes in the sometimes in the abandoned quarries of montmatre or montrouge sometimes in the sewers they ran to earth 
 what became of these men 
 they still exist 
 they have always existed horace speaks of them 
 ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici mimae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are 
 beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins the individuals extirpated the tribe subsists 
 they always have the same faculties 
 from the vagrant to the tramp the race is maintained in its purity 
 they divine purses in pockets they scent out watches in fobs 
 gold and silver possess an odor for them 
 there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they have a stealable air 
 these men patiently pursue these bourgeois 
 they experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country 
 these men are terrible when one encounters them or catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard they do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in no wise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night 
 what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish 
 light light in floods 
 not a single bat can resist the dawn light up society from below

 for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from the village but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them she thought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused by cares for the present seemed already to belong to the past now she could remember it and weep or pray 
 after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh toward midnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began to rise and stillness reigned over the village and the house 
 pictures of the near past her illness and last moments rose one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images repelling with horror only the last one the picture of his death which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night and these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present now past and now future 
 she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills muttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her 
 even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died she thought he had always thought what he said then and she recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tikhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk and why he call me why he let me be there instead of tikhon princess mary had thought and thought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say and not tikhon but i might have heard and understood him why i enter the room she thought perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was standing close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand him i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were alive he had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted fool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why i go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost and perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death she repeated and began sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face before her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said 
 she repeated again 
 what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking now this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do neither with eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows expecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast 
 dunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her

 summer passed then the autumn winter came 
 neither m leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden thenceforth marius had but one gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face 
 he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing 
 he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute ardent man the bold defier of fate the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was a lost dog he fell into a black melancholy 
 all was over 
 work disgusted him walking tired him 
 vast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels perspectives horizons teachings now lay empty before him 
 it seemed to him that everything had disappeared 
 he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts 
 to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use 
 he heaped a hundred reproaches on himself 
 why did i follow her i was so happy at the mere sight of her 
 she looked at me was not that immense 
 she had the air of loving me 
 was not that everything 
 i wished to have what 
 there was nothing after that 
 i have been absurd 
 it is my own fault etc etc courfeyrac to whom he confided was his nature but who made some little guess at was his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him 
 i see that you have been simply an animal 
 here come to the chaumiere 
 once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac bossuet and grantaire hoping what a dream that he might perhaps find her there 
 of course he did not see the one he this is the place all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grantaire in an aside 
 marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the along the road in order to refresh his head 
 he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love 
 on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect 
 he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair 
 marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation 
 strange to say he thought that he recognized m leblanc 
 the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed 
 but why these clothes what was the meaning of this 
 what signified that disguise marius was greatly astonished 
 when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking 
 in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery but the idea occurred to him too late the man was no longer there he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him 
 this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced 
 after all he said to himself it was probably only a resemblance

 chapter xiii 
 
 on the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin accompanied by lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly left their quarters at yankovo ten miles from bogucharovo and went for a ride to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages 
 for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as for the french vanguard rostov as a careful squadron commander wished to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french could get them 
 rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to bogucharovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questioned lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one another to try horse 
 rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister 
 rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching bogucharovo and rostov outstripping ilyin was the first to gallop into the village street 
 first cried ilyin flushed 
 yes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostov stroking his heated donets horse 
 and have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka from behind alluding to his shabby cart horse only i wish to mortify you 
 they rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants was standing 
 some of the men bared their heads others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering and singing some incoherent song and approached the officers 
 fine fellows said rostov laughing is there any hay here 
 and how like one another said ilyin 
 a sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile 
 one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov 
 who do you belong to he asked 
 the french replied ilyin jestingly and here is napoleon himself and he pointed to lavrushka 
 then you are russians the peasant asked again 
 and is there a large force of you here said another a short man coming up 
 very large answered rostov but why have you collected here he added is it a holiday 
 the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune replied the peasant moving away 
 at that moment on the road leading from the big house two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers 
 the one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing dunyasha running resolutely toward him 
 be ours said lavrushka to ilyin winking 
 what do you want my pretty said ilyin with a smile 
 the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name 
 this is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble servant 
 roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych advanced to rostov having bared his head while still at a distance 
 may i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom my mistress daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people he pointed to the peasants asks you to come up to the house you please ride on a little farther said alpatych with a melancholy smile as it is not convenient in the presence of he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse 
 ah alpatych ah yakov alpatych grand forgive us for sake eh said the peasants smiling joyfully at him 
 rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled 
 or perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid air as he pointed at the old men with his free hand 
 no not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode on a little way the matter he asked 
 i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here wish to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to unharness her horses so that though everything has been packed up since morning her excellency cannot get away 
 impossible exclaimed rostov 
 i have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatych 
 rostov dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpatych to the house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appeared that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day and her talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village that there was an order not to move and that they would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish them but was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing himself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go that there was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything 
 at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych her nurse and the maids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman ran away and the women in the house began to wail 
 father benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices as rostov passed through the anteroom 
 princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room when rostov was shown in she could not grasp who he was and why he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his russian face and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event a helpless girl overwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasants and what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story 
 when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her funeral her voiced trembled she turned away and then as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten 
 i cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostov rising go when you please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort and bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved toward the door 
 deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her 
 princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy 
 i am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she suddenly began to cry 
 excuse me she said 
 rostov knitting his brows left the room with another low bow

 treasure trove 
 marius had not left the gorbeau house 
 he paid no attention to any one there 
 at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those jondrettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters 
 the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment 
 one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon but it was the d of february that ancient candlemas day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks cold spell inspired mathieu laensberg with these two lines which have with justice remained classic 
 luise ou luiserne 
 rentre dans en sa caverne 
 whether the sun shines brightly or dim the bear returns to his cave 
 marius had just emerged from his 
 night was falling 
 it was the hour for his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again alas oh infirmities of ideal passions 
 he had just crossed his threshold where bougon was sweeping at the moment as she uttered this memorable monologue 
 what is there that is cheap now 
 everything is dear 
 there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world 
 marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue he was walking along with drooping head 
 all at once he felt some one elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet 
 they were talking as they ran 
 the taller said in a very low voice 
 the bobbies have come 
 they came near nabbing me at the the other answered 
 i saw them 
 i bolted bolted bolted 
 through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had escaped 
 they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared 
 marius had halted for a moment 
 he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet 
 he stooped and picked it up 
 it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers 
 good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it 
 he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine 
 on the way he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard a coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle 
 the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind 
 poor mothers he thought 
 there is one thing sadder than to see children die it is to see them leading an evil life 
 then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations 
 he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg 
 how gloomy my life has become he said to himself 
 young girls are always appearing to me only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls

 chapter xiv 
 
 well is she pretty ah friend my pink one is delicious her name is dunyasha 
 but on glancing at face ilyin stopped short he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought 
 rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village 
 show them give it to them the brigands said he to himself 
 alpatych at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up with him with difficulty 
 what decision have you been pleased to come to said he 
 rostov stopped and clenching his fists suddenly and sternly turned on alpatych 
 decision what decision old dotard cried he what have you been about eh the peasants are rioting and you manage them a traitor youself i know you flay you all alive and as if afraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidly forward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it not be better first to send for the military 
 give them armed force overresist them uttered rostov meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it 
 without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the more alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face 
 after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked their 
 how many years have you been fattening on the commune karp shouted at him all one to you dig up your pot of money and take it away with you what does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not 
 been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain and all about it cried another 
 it was your turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudged your lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dron and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier but we all have to die 
 to be sure we all have to die not against the commune said dron 
 it not against it filled your belly 
 the two tall peasants had their say as soon as rostov followed by ilyin lavrushka and alpatych came up to the crowd karp thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the front dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together 
 who is your elder here hey shouted rostov coming up to the crowd with quick steps 
 the elder what do you want with him asked karp 
 but before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side 
 caps off traitors shouted rostov in a wrathful voice the elder he cried furiously 
 the elder he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads 
 we riot following the orders declared karp and at that moment several voices began speaking together 
 as the old men have decided too many of you giving orders 
 arguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own gripping karp by the collar bind him bind him he shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych 
 lavrushka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind 
 shall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called out 
 alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts 
 the elder demanded rostov in a loud voice 
 with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd 
 are you the elder bind him lavrushka shouted rostov as if that order too could not possibly meet with any opposition 
 and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his own belt and handed it to them as if to aid them 
 and you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants be off to your houses at once and let one of your voices be heard 
 why not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heard bickering with one another 
 there what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again wrong lads 
 all our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village 
 the two bound men were led off to the house the two drunken peasants followed them 
 aye when i look at you said one of them to karp 
 how can one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking of you fool added the other a real fool 
 two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the bogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out the goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at princess wish from the cupboard where he had been confined was standing in the yard directing the men 
 put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with a round smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid you know it has cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where get rubbed i like that way of doing things let it all be done properly according to rule look here put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay the way 
 eh books books said another peasant bringing out prince library cupboards catch up against it heavy lads solid books 
 yes they worked all day and play remarked the tall peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top 
 unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops at the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand 
 how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had occurred any police officer would have done as much if we had had only peasants to fight we should not have let the enemy come so far said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you want to make me blush please thank me 
 but the princess if she did not again thank him in words thanked him with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did leave her memory 
 when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her did she love him 
 on the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was not a cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow 
 well supposing i do love him thought princess mary 
 ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life 
 sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his words happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window 
 was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very moment thought princess mary and that caused his sister to refuse my brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence 
 the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one to remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of his adventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune had against his will more than once entered his head for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy would be able to put his affairs in order and would even he felt it ensure princess happiness 
 but sonya and his plighted word that was why rostov grew angry when he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya

 quadrifrons 
 that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard 
 he had forgotten it he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it 
 he opened the envelope 
 it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed 
 they bore addresses 
 all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco 
 the first was addressed 
 to madame madame la marquise de grucheray the place opposite the chamber of deputies no 
 marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety 
 it was conceived as follows 
 madame la marquise 
 the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unites sosiety 
 turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune evverything to defend that cause and finds himself in the greatest missery he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate 
 their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir 
 my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be 
 madame 
 don alvares spanish captain 
 of cavalry a royalist who 
 has take refuge in france 
 who finds himself on travells 
 for his country and the 
 resources are lacking him to 
 continue his travells 
 no address was joined to the signature 
 marius hoped to find the address in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la comtesse de montvernet rue cassette no this is what marius read in it 
 madame la comtesse 
 it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old 
 i sick since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance 
 in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect 
 mistress balizard 
 marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding he read 
 monsieur pabourgeot elector wholesale stocking merchant 
 rue on the corner of the rue aux fers 
 i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit 
 there are couplets to be sung in four places 
 the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously and ends after striking altarations in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes 
 my principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind 
 in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism of priviliged authors may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which are treated 
 monsiuer pabourgeot your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season 
 when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name 
 if you deign to honor me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude which i shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage 
 to monsieur 
 and madame pabourgeot 
 my most respectful complements 
 genflot man of letters 
 p s even if it is only forty sous 
 excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas to go out 
 finally marius opened the fourth letter 
 the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of it contained the following lines 
 benevolent man 
 if you deign to accompany my daughter you will behold a misserable calamity and i will show you my certificates 
 at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers always feel lively emotions 
 admit compassionate man that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved 
 destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others 
 i await your presence or your offering if you deign to make one and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be truly magnanimous man your very humble and very obedient servant p fabantou dramatic artist 
 after perusing these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before 
 in the first place not one of the signers gave his address 
 then they seemed to come from four different individuals don alveras mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramatic artist fabantou but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand 
 what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person 
 moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four the odor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the man of letters genflot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain 
 it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery 
 had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him 
 it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind buff between the four letters and that they were making sport of him 
 nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard 
 after all they were evidently papers of no value 
 marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed about seven in the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and was trying to settle down to work when there came a soft knock at his door 
 as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work even when absent he left his key in the lock 
 you will be robbed said bougon 
 of what said marius 
 the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of bougon 
 there came a second knock as gentle as the first 
 come in said marius 
 the door opened 
 what do you want bougon asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table 
 a voice which did not belong to bougon replied 
 excuse me sir 
 it was a dull broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man roughened with brandy and liquor 
 marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl

 chapter xv 
 
 on receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters 
 prince andrew arrived at on the very day and at the very hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time he stopped in the village at the house in front of which stood the commander in carriage and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his serene highness as everyone now called kutuzov from the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting hurrah to the new commander in chief two orderlies a courier and a stood near by some ten paces from prince andrew availing themselves of absence and of the fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince andrew inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back 
 prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness staff but was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in orderly speaks to officers replied 
 what his serene highness i expect be here soon what do you want 
 the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner and approached bolkonski with a slight bow bolkonski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him 
 also waiting for the commander in chief said he they say he weceives evewyone thank god awful with those sausage eaters ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german now wussians will get a look in as it was devil only knows what was happening we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in the campaign he asked 
 i had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dear not to mention the estate and home of my birth my father who died of grief i belong to the province of smolensk 
 ah pwince bolkonski vewy glad to make your acquaintance lieutenant colonel denisov better known as vaska said denisov pressing prince hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention yes i heard said he sympathetically and after a short pause added yes scythian warfare all vewy well only not for those who get it in the neck so you are pwince andwew bolkonski he swayed his head vewy pleased pwince to make your acquaintance he repeated again smiling sadly and he again pressed prince hand 
 prince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her first suitor this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found place in his soul of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions such as the retreat from smolensk his visit to bald hills and the recent news of his death and had experienced so many emotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly their former strength for denisov too the memories awakened by the name of bolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and after singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for natasha and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to kutuzov the plan was based on the fact that the french line of operation was to extended and it proposed that instead of or concurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the french we should attack their line of communication he began explaining his plan to prince andrew 
 they hold all that line impossible i will undertake to bweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line certain only one way guewilla warfare 
 denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkonski in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village 
 coming coming shouted a cossack standing at the gate 
 bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers a guard of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generals rode behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting hurrah 
 his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and he raised his hand to his white horse cap with a red band and no peak nodding his head continually when he came up to the guard of honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations who were giving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity 
 and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well general he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and denisov 
 hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted those behind him 
 since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still more corpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball the scar and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same he was wearing the white horse cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse 
 whew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrup and lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his knee groaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him 
 he pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glanced at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with his waddling gait to the porch whew whew whew he whistled and again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old men it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince face linked itself up with remembrance of his personality 
 ah how do you do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy come along said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight 
 he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch 
 and your father 
 i received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew abruptly 
 kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself 
 may the kingdom of heaven be his will be done to us all he sighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while i loved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my heart 
 he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for some time did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw that flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself 
 come come with me have a talk said he 
 but at that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutuzov his hands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denisov having given his name announced that he had to communicate to his serene highness a matter of great importance for their welfare kutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words for our welfare well what is it speak denisov blushed like a girl it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov came from those parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it and from that hut while denisov was speaking a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear 
 what said kutuzov in the midst of explanations are you ready so soon 
 ready your serene highness replied the general 
 kutuzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal with it all and again listened to denisov 
 i give my word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that i can bweak line of communication 
 what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov asked kutuzov interrupting him 
 he is my uncle your sewene highness 
 ah we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all right friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow have a talk 
 with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovnitsyn had brought him 
 would not your serene highness like to come inside said the general on duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed 
 an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged he made a grimace 
 no tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy look at them here said he go away he added turning to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the report 
 while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serene highness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in the house very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at those words kutuzov looked round he was listening to the report which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at as he had listened to denisov and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a piece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him that he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all only because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the point what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point but it was evident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew of something else that would decide the matter something independent of clever ness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander in face attentively and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelings or knowledge he did not try to display any of these but because of something else he despised them because of his old age and experience of life the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the russian troops at the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation 
 after hearing the matter kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head 
 into the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all my dear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts content i order it or allow it but i exact compensation either one get on without it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the paper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his head

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter iv 
 
 a rose in misery 
 a very young girl was standing in the door 
 the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor red hands a and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep 
 marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams 
 the most thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely 
 in her early childhood she must even have been pretty 
 the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a day 
 that face was not wholly unknown to marius 
 he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere 
 what do you wish mademoiselle he asked 
 the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict 
 here is a letter for you monsieur marius 
 she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl 
 how did she know his name 
 without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade bed 
 her feet were bare 
 large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees 
 she was shivering 
 she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius 
 marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist 
 the message could not have come from a distance 
 he read 
 my amiable neighbor young man 
 i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months ago 
 i bless you young man my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill 
 if i am not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor 
 i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity 
 jondrette 
 my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius 
 this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar 
 all was suddenly illuminated 
 this letter came from the same place as the other four there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco 
 there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signer 
 the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were named jondrette 
 marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors 
 his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also he had been obliged more than once to pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere 
 now he saw everything clearly 
 he understood that his neighbor jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake 
 marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery 
 sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility 
 souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre 
 she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness 
 occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell almost to her waist 
 she moved the chairs about she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners 
 hullo said she you have a mirror 
 and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious 
 an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood 
 effrontery is a disgrace 
 nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming 
 never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey 
 that is only to be seen among men 
 marius reflected and allowed her to have her way 
 she approached the table 
 ah said she books 
 a flash pierced her glassy eye 
 she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible 
 i know how to read i do 
 she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency 
 general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade 
 she paused 
 ah 
 waterloo 
 i know about that 
 it was a battle long ago my father was there 
 my father has served in the armies 
 we are fine bonapartists in our house that we are 
 waterloo was against the english 
 she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed 
 and i know how to write too 
 she dipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius 
 do you want to see 
 look here going to write a word to show you 
 and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table 
 the bobbies are here 
 then throwing down the pen 
 there are no faults of orthography 
 you can look 
 we have received an education my sister and i we have not always been as we are now we were not made 
 here she paused fixed her dull eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish stifled by every form of cynicism 
 bah 
 and she began to hum these words to a gay faim mon pere 
 i am hungry father 
 pas de fricot i have no food 
 froid ma mere 
 i am cold mother 
 pas de tricot i have no clothes 
 grelotte 
 lolotte lolotte 
 shiver sanglote 
 sob jacquot 
 jacquot 
 she had hardly finished this couplet when she exexclaimed 
 do you ever go to the play monsieur marius 
 i do 
 i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes 
 but i like the benches in the galleries one is cramped and uncomfortable there 
 there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad 
 then she scrutinized marius assumed a singular air and said 
 do you know mr marius that you are a very handsome fellow 
 and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made her smile and him blush 
 she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder 
 you pay no heed to me but i know you mr marius 
 i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter it is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus 
 she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep 
 a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing 
 marius had retreated gently 
 mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think 
 permit me to return it to you 
 and he held out the envelope containing the four letters 
 she clapped her hands and exclaimed 
 we have been looking everywhere for that 
 then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as she did so 
 dieu de dieu how my sister and i have hunted 
 and it was you who found it 
 on the boulevard was it not 
 it must have been on the boulevard 
 you see we let it fall when we were running it was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid 
 when we got home we could not find it anywhere 
 as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us nix so here they are those poor letters 
 and how did you find out that they belonged to me 
 ah yes the writing 
 so it was you that we jostled as we passed last night 
 we see i said to my sister 
 is it a gentleman 
 my sister said to me i think it is a gentleman 
 in the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of 
 here said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass by the way this is his hour 
 go and carry it to him perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on 
 then she began to laugh again and added 
 do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday our dinner of and all that at once and this morning 
 come 
 parbleu if you are not satisfied dogs burst 
 this reminded marius of the wretched errand to himself he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there 
 the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius presence 
 i often go off in the evening 
 sometimes i come home again last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges 
 we huddled together to keep from freezing my little sister cried 
 how melancholy the water is 
 when i thought of drowning myself i said to myself 
 no too cold i go out alone whenever i choose i sometimes sleep in the ditches do you know at night when i walk along the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and as big as notre dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say to myself 
 why water there 
 the stars are like the lamps in illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is night i hear and and i know what all 
 i think people are flinging stones at me i flee without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls you feel very queer when you have had no food 
 and then she stared at him with a bewildered air 
 by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous 
 this was all he owned in the world for the moment 
 at all events he thought there is my dinner for and we will see 
 he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five francs to the young girl 
 she seized the coin 
 good said she the sun is shining 
 and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on 
 five francs the shiner a monarch in this hole 
 this fine a jolly thief 
 your humble servant 
 bravo for the good fellows 
 two days wine and meat and stew have a royal feast and a good fill 
 she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying 
 good morning sir 
 all right 
 go and find my old man 
 as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it and bit into it muttering 
 good hard it breaks my teeth 
 then she departed 
 a rose in misery 
 a very young girl was standing in the door 
 the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor red hands a and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep

 and then she stared at him with a bewildered air 
 by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous 
 this was all he owned in the world for the moment 
 at all events he thought there is my dinner for and we will see 
 he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five francs to the young girl 
 she seized the coin 
 good said she the sun is shining 
 and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on 
 five francs the shiner a monarch in this hole 
 this fine a jolly thief 
 your humble servant 
 bravo for the good fellows 
 two days wine and meat and stew have a royal feast and a good fill 
 she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying 
 good morning sir 
 all right 
 go and find my old man 
 as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it and bit into it muttering 
 good hard it breaks my teeth 
 then she departed

 well all said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression 
 the wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long been preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov 
 he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and said 
 ah what a beauty thank you sweetheart 
 he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he asked moving to the door of the room assigned to him the wife smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov he found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned overcoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis 
 well sit down sit down here have a talk said kutuzov sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you a second father 
 prince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his death and what he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it 
 what what they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince story the condition russia was in but give me time give me time he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me 
 i thank your serene highness but i fear i am longer fit for the staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed 
 kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him 
 but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regiment am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should be sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you believe me 
 a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up podgy face he cut bolkonski short 
 i am sorry for i need you but right right not here that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are not the regiments would not be what they are if the advisers served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember yes i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and a flush of pleasure suffused prince face at this recollection 
 taking his hand and drawing him downwards kutuzov offered his cheek to be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old eyes though prince andrew knew that tears came easily and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him 
 go your way and god be with you i know your path is the path of honor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to send and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much blamed he said both for that war and the peace but everything came at the right time tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning to the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah those advisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war everything in haste but more haste less speed kamenski would have been lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign for that storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made the but eat horseflesh he swayed his head and the french shall too believe me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest make them eat horseflesh and tears again dimmed his eyes 
 everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait 
 but we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew 
 we shall if everybody wants it it be helped but believe me my dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience and time they will do it all but the advisers pas de cette oreille voila le mal some want a thing others one to do he asked evidently expecting an answer well what do you want us to do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look tell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did not reply i will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute mon cher he paused he articulated the french proverb deliberately 
 see it that way the trouble 
 when in doubt my dear fellow do nothing 
 well my dear fellow remember that with all my heart i share your sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a prince nor a commander in chief but a father if you want anything come straight to me my dear boy 
 again he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis 
 prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was but after that interview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions and in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusions only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should he will not bring in any plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anything thought prince andrew but he will hear everything remember everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will the inevitable course of events and he can see them and grasp their significance and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else and above all thought prince andrew one believes in him because russian despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when he said what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said he would make them eat horseflesh 
 on such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity and general approval were founded with which despite court influences the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter v 
 
 a providential 
 marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery 
 true misery he had but just had a view of it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes in fact he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child 
 when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time 
 woe to the defenceless beings who surround him 
 work wages bread fire courage good will all fail him simultaneously 
 the light of day seems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy 
 then all horrors become possible 
 despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vice or crime 
 health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accomodates itself to it fathers mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters adhere and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes relationships ages infamies and innocences 
 they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of fate they exchange glances 
 oh the unfortunate wretches how pale they are 
 how cold they are 
 it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours 
 this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm 
 of sad shadows 
 she revealed to him a hideous side of the night 
 marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day 
 the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which any one would have yielded to but he marius should have done better than that 
 what only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no heed to them every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend an ear 
 and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen to them his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible radiances to loves in the air to follies and all the while human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated it for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very vile very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal word the miserable whose fault is this 
 and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great 
 while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the jondrettes as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people 
 the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished only a man as dreamy as marius could have failed to perceive this long before 
 there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the jondrettes or on that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness 
 marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes revery examines observes and scrutinizes as thought would 
 all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode a view could be had through this aperture into the jondrettes attic 
 commiseration has and should have its curiosity 
 this aperture formed a sort of it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it 
 the is a judas in french 
 hence the allusion 
 let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought marius and in what condition they are 
 he climbed upon the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked

 chapter xvii 
 
 after the emperor had left moscow life flowed on there in its usual course and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the stay was the call for contributions of men and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal official form and became unavoidable 
 with the approach to moscow the moscovites view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it the other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger since it is not in power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and to think about what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to the first voice but in society to the second so it was now with the inhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay in moscow as that year 
 broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potman and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin who having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub heard that napoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the french in very bad language came out of the drink shop and under the sign of the eagle began to address the assembled people were read and discussed together with the latest of vasili lvovich bouts rimes 
 in the corner room at the club members gathered to read these broadsheets and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french saying they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with our buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon among them but this was told chiefly to introduce witty remark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat and rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez en vousmemes entrez dans la barque et faites pas une barque de charon there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from moscow and to this witticism was added that for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and that bezukhov had spent even more on his but that the best thing about action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show 
 think it over get into the barque and take care not to make it a barque of charon 
 you spare anyone said julie drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin beringed fingers 
 julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree 
 bezukhov est ridicule but he is so kind and what pleasure is there to be so caustique 
 a forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called mon chevalier and who was going with her to nizhni 
 in set as in many other circles in moscow it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary contributions 
 another forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who was present what pleasure is there to be is not russian 
 you spare no one continued julie to the young man without heeding the remark 
 for caustique i am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i be responsible she remarked turning to the author i have neither the money nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a master to teach me russian 
 ah here he is she added quand on no no she said to the militia officer you catch me speak of the sun and you see its rays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of you she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than 
 oh talk to me of my regiment replied pierre kissing his hostess hand and taking a seat beside her i am so sick of it 
 you will of course command it yourself said julie directing a sly sarcastic glance toward the militia officer 
 the latter in presence had ceased to be caustic and his face expressed perplexity as to what smile might mean in spite of his and good nature personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face 
 no said pierre with a laughing glance at his big stout body i should make too good a target for the french besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a horse 
 among those whom guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostovs 
 i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie and he is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near moscow but it drags on and on he asks too much 
 no i think the sale will come off in a few days said someone though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now 
 why asked julie you think moscow is in danger 
 then why are you leaving 
 i what a question i am going because well because everyone is going and besides i am not joan of arc or an amazon 
 well of course of course let me have some more strips of linen 
 if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts said the militia officer speaking of rostov 
 a kindly old man but not up to much and why do they stay on so long in moscow they meant to leave for the country long ago natalie is quite well again now she julie asked pierre with a knowing smile 
 they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is being formed but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day the count wanted to leave long ago but the countess on any account leave moscow till her son returns 
 i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter she sang a song how easily some people get over everything 
 get over what inquired pierre looking displeased 
 julie smiled 
 you know count such knights as you are only found in madame de novels 
 what knights what do you mean demanded pierre blushing 
 oh come my dear count la fable de tout moscou je vous admire ma parole 
 it is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you 
 forfeit forfeit cried the militia officer 
 all right one talk how tiresome 
 what is the talk of all moscow pierre asked angrily rising to his feet 
 come now count you know 
 i know anything about it said pierre 
 i know you were friendly with natalie and so but i was always more friendly with vera that dear vera 
 no madame pierre continued in a tone of displeasure i have not taken on myself the role of natalie knight at all and have not been their house for nearly a month but i cannot understand the cruelty 
 qui said julie smiling and waving the lint triumphantly and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject do you know what i heard today poor mary bolkonskaya arrived in moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her father 
 who excuses himself accuses himself 
 really where is she i should like very much to see her said pierre 
 i spent the evening with her yesterday she is going to their estate near moscow either today or tomorrow morning with her nephew 
 well and how is she asked pierre 
 she is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is quite a romance nicholas rostov she was surrounded and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people he rushed in and saved her 
 another romance said the militia officer really this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off catiche is one and princess bolkonskaya another 
 do you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme 
 a little bit in love with the young man 
 forfeit forfeit forfeit 
 but how could one say that in russian

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter vi 
 
 the wild man in his lair 
 cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves 
 only in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful 
 taking one lair with another the is preferable to the caverns are better than hovels 
 what marius now beheld was a hovel 
 marius was poor and his chamber was but as his poverty was noble his garret was neat 
 the den upon which his eye now rested was abject dirty fetid pestiferous mean sordid 
 the only furniture consisted of a straw chair an infirm table some old bits of crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes draped with spiders webs 
 through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom 
 the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them 
 obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them 
 the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor planked its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the pressure of feet 
 upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs a year there was every sort of thing in that fireplace a brazier a pot broken boards rags suspended from nails a ashes and even a little fire 
 two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way 
 one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large 
 it had projections and angles and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and promontories 
 hence horrible unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as fist as large as foot and perhaps knows some monstrous human beings must be hiding 
 one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius 
 in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription 
 the dream this represented a sleeping woman and a child also asleep the child on the lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the head without awaking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription 
 maringo 
 austerlits 
 iena wagramme 
 elot 
 beneath this frame a sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall 
 it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung 
 near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and paper sat a man about sixty years of age small thin livid haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel 
 if lavater had studied this visage he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible 
 this man had a long gray beard 
 he was clad in a chemise which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen 
 beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible 
 he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking 
 there was no bread in the hovel but there was still tobacco 
 he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read 
 on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mo of betrayed a romance 
 on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capitals 
 god the king honor and the ladies by ducray duminil 
 as the man wrote he talked aloud and marius heard his words 
 the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead just look at pere lachaise 
 the great those who are rich are up above in the acacia alley which is paved 
 they can reach it in a carriage the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places 
 they are put there so that they will decay the sooner you cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth 
 he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth 
 oh 
 i could eat the whole world 
 a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels 
 she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth 
 a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat 
 although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature she was a sort of giant beside her husband 
 she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails 
 beside her on the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance 
 on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living 
 no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room 
 she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age 
 on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen 
 she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted 
 she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly 
 it is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants 
 these creatures have neither childhood nor youth 
 at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they seem twenty 
 a little girl a woman one might say that they stride through life in order to get through with it the more speedily 
 at this moment this being had the air of a child 
 moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no not a tool 
 in one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect 
 it was the dull listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony 
 marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt fluttering there and life was palpitating there 
 the garret the cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by side with them places its greatest miseries in that vestibule 
 the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did not even seem to breathe 
 the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible 
 the man grumbled without pausing in his writing 
 canaille canaille everybody is canaille 
 this variation to exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman 
 calm yourself my little friend she said 
 hurt yourself my dear 
 you are too good to write to all those people husband 
 bodies press close to each other in misery as in cold but hearts draw apart 
 this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this had become extinct 
 there no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband 
 nevertheless caressing appellations had survived as is often the case 
 she called him 
 my dear my little friend my good man etc with her mouth while her heart was silent 
 the man resumed his writing

 book ten 
 chapter xviii 
 
 when pierre returned home he was handed two of broadsheets that had been brought that day 
 the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden people to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad that ladies and wives were leaving the city there will be less panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will stake my life on it that that will not enter moscow these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma that count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a low price the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former chigirin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near 
 shall i join the army and enter the service or wait he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience 
 if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the cards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes out it means what does it mean 
 he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in 
 then it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himself come in come in he added to the princess 
 only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waist was still living in house the two younger ones had both married 
 excuse my coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and agitated voice you know some decision must be come to what is going to happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is it that we are staying on 
 on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor 
 satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit and the people too are quite mutinous they no longer obey even my maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon begin beating us one walk in the streets but above all the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just one thing of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken to petersburg whatever i may be i live under rule 
 oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the contrary 
 i submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you want to do this 
 but i will give the order at once 
 the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with muttering to herself she sat down on a chair 
 but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger see just been reading he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow 
 oh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is a hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly and honor and glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajolery has brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in french 
 oh but so you take everything so to heart said pierre and began laying out his cards for patience 
 although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible 
 next day toward evening the princess set off and head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates in general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able to repress a smile 
 well then sell it said he to be done i draw back now 
 the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was left in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained but he did not go to see them 
 to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the desire the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows 
 as soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let him know i have informed him of the matter 
 please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time that he may not make a mistake and fall into the hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief 
 on his way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe place pierre seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and got out of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged the flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a green jacket who was moaning piteously another criminal thin and pale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin face pierre pushed his way in through the crowd 
 what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking 
 but the attention of the crowd officials burghers shopkeepers peasants and women in cloaks and in pelisses was so eagerly centered on what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stout man rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people began talking loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to pierre 
 cook to some prince 
 eh mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the frenchman began to cry 
 the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated some people began to laugh others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man 
 pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him 
 what is your pleasure 
 where are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to lubyanka street 
 to the as you ordered answered the coachman 
 fool idiot shouted pierre abusing his coachman a thing he rarely did home i told you and drive faster blockhead i must get away this very day he murmured to himself 
 at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself 
 on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey his head coachman who knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscow that he would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that his saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on representation pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance 
 on the the weather cleared up after a spell of rain and after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that evening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk 
 every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had it was full of officers 
 everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the visit a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes happiness the comforts of life wealth even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation

 strategy and tactics 
 marius with a load upon his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post 
 the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly 
 the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold 
 on her feet she had large coarse shoes bespattered with mud which had splashed even to her red ankles and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters 
 marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging she entered pushed the door to behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy 
 he is coming 
 the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir 
 who demanded her father 
 the gentleman 
 the philanthropist 
 yes 
 from the church of 
 yes 
 that old fellow 
 yes 
 and he is coming 
 he is following me 
 you are sure 
 i am sure 
 there truly he is coming 
 he is coming in a fiacre 
 in a fiacre 
 he is rothschild 
 the father rose 
 how are you sure 
 if he is coming in a fiacre how is it that you arrive before him 
 you gave him our address at least 
 did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right if he only does not make a mistake 
 so you found him at the church did he read my letter 
 what did he say to you 
 ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my good man see here 
 i entered the church he was in his usual place i made him a reverence and i handed him the letter he read it and said to me where do you live my child 
 i said 
 monsieur i will show you he said to me 
 no give me your address my daughter has some purchases to make i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do 
 i gave him the address 
 when i mentioned the house he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant then he said never mind i will come 
 when the mass was finished i watched him leave the church with his daughter and i saw them enter a carriage 
 i certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor on the right 
 and what makes you think that he will come 
 i have just seen the fiacre turn into the rue that is what made me run so 
 how do you know that it was the same fiacre 
 because i took notice of the number so there 
 what was the number 
 
 good you are a clever girl 
 the girl stared boldly at her father and showing the shoes which she had on her feet 
 a clever girl possibly but i tell you i put these shoes on again and that i for the sake of my health in the first place and for the sake of cleanliness in the next i know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch and go ghi ghi ghi the whole time 
 i prefer to go barefoot 
 you are right said her father in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young rudeness but then you will not be allowed to enter churches for poor people must have shoes to do that one cannot go barefoot to the good god he added bitterly 
 then returning to the subject which absorbed him 
 so you are sure that he will come 
 he is following on my heels said she 
 the man started up 
 a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance 
 wife he exclaimed you hear 
 here is the philanthropist extinguish the fire 
 the stupefied mother did not stir 
 the father with the agility of an acrobat seized a jug which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands 
 then addressing his eldest daughter 
 here you 
 pull the straw off that chair 
 his daughter did not understand 
 he seized the chair and with one kick he rendered it seatless his leg passed through it 
 as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter 
 is it cold 
 very cold 
 it is snowing 
 the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window and shouted to her in a thundering voice 
 quick get off that bed you lazy thing will you never do anything break a pane of glass 
 the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver 
 break a pane he repeated 
 the child stood still in bewilderment 
 do you hear me repeated her father i tell you to break a pane 
 the child with a sort of terrified obedience rose on tiptoe and struck a pane with her fist 
 the glass broke and fell with a loud clatter 
 good said the father 
 he was grave and abrupt 
 his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret 
 one would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning 
 the mother who had not said a word so far now rose and demanded in a dull slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state 
 what do you mean to do my dear 
 get into bed replied the man 
 his intonation admitted of no deliberation 
 the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets 
 in the meantime a sob became audible in one corner 
 that cried the father 
 the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist without quitting the corner in which she was cowering 
 she had wounded herself while breaking the window she went off near her pallet and wept silently 
 it was now the turn to start up and exclaim 
 just see there 
 what follies you commit 
 she has cut herself breaking that pane for you 
 so much the better said the man 
 i foresaw that 
 what 
 so much the better retorted his wife 
 peace replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press 
 then tearing the chemise which he was wearing he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little bleeding wrist 
 that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise 
 and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance 
 an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room the outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers 
 through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling 
 the snow promised by the candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come 
 the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing 
 he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them 
 then drawing himself up and leaning against the 
 now said he we can receive the philanthropist

 book ten 
 chapter xix 
 
 on the of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was fought on the not a shot was fired by either side and on the the battle of borodino itself took place 
 why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world what the result must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle 
 if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutuzov this was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am 
 before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gave it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate 
 in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius the generals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary 
 the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless 
 on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows 
 the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodino 
 the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle to it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle was fought 
 in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on the attacked the whole russian army which was in position on the field of borodino 
 so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself 
 the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard 
 not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that is the position on which the battle took place but never till the of august did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the and were not completed and secondly by the position of the shevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an advanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutuzov himself in his report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of the shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched 
 the case was evidently this a position was selected along the river kolocha which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle so that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank near the village of novoe and the center at borodino at the confluence of the rivers kolocha and voyna 
 to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought this position protected by the river kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow 
 napoleon riding to valuevo on the did not see as the history books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa to borodino he could not have seen that position because it did not exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians not having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semenovsk and borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the of august took place 
 had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the to the kolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our and the battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the in the position we intended and had fortified but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rea guard that is immediately after the fight at gridneva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the the first and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the 
 after the loss of the shevardino redoubt we found ourselves on the morning of the without a position for our left flank and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be 
 not only was the russian army on the defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders not having fully realized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left maintained their extended position from the village of novoe to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men action against utitsa and on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people it has been described the battle of borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of the shevardino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight

 of counsel 
 the greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel for in other confidences men commit the parts of life their lands their goods their children their credit some particular affair but to such as they make their counsellors they commit the whole by how much the more they are obliged to all faith and integrity 
 
 the wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness or derogation to their sufficiency to rely upon counsel god himself is not without but hath made it one of the great names of his blessed son the counsellor solomon hath pronounced that in counsel is stability things will have their first or second agitation if they be not tossed upon the arguments of counsel they will be tossed upon the waves of fortune and be full of inconstancy doing and undoing like the reeling of a drunken man son found the force of counsel as his father saw the necessity of it 
 for the beloved kingdom of god was first rent and broken by ill counsel upon 
 which counsel there are set for our instruction the two marks whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned that it was young counsel for the persons 
 and violent counsel for the matter 
 
 the ancient times do set forth in figure both the incorporation and inseparable 
 conjunction of counsel with kings and the wise and politic use of counsel by kings the one in that they say jupiter did many metis which signifieth counsel whereby they intend that sovereignty is married to counsel the other in that which followeth which was thus they say after jupiter was married to metis she conceived by him and was with child but jupiter suffered her not to stay till she brought forth but ate her up whereby he became himself with child and was delivered of pallas armed out of his head which monstrous fable contained a secret of empire how kings are to make use of their counsel of state 
 that first they ought to refer matters unto them which is the first begetting or impregnation but when they are elaborate moulded and shaped in the womb of their counsel and grow ripe and ready to be brought forth that then they suffer not their counsel to go through with the resolution and direction as if it depended on them but take the matter back into their own hands and make it appear to the world that the decrees and final directions which because they come forth with prudence and power are resembled to pallas armed proceeded from themselves and not only from their authority but 
 the more to add reputation to themselves from their head and device 
 
 let us now speak of the inconveniences of counsel and of the remedies the 
 inconveniences that have been noted in calling and using counsel are three 
 first the revealing of affairs whereby they become less secret secondly the weakening of the authority of princes as if they were less of themselves thirdly the danger of being unfaithfully counselled and more for me good of them that counsel than of him that is counselled for which inconveniences the doctrine of italy and practice of france in some kings times haul introduced cabinet counsels a remedy worse then the disease 
 
 as to secrecy princes are not bound to communicate all matters with all counsellors but may extract and select neither is it necessary that he that consulteth what he should do should declare what he will do but let princes beware that the unsecreting of their affairs comes not from themselves and as for cabinet counsels it may be their motto plows rimarum sum one futile person that maketh it his glory to tell will do more hurt than many that know it their duty to conceal it is true there be some affairs which require extreme secrecy which will hardly go beyond one or two persons besides the king neither are those counsels unprosperous for besides the secrecy they commonly go on constantly in one spirit of direction without distraction 
 but then it must be a prudent king such as is able to grind with a 
 and those inward counsellors had need also be wise men and especially true and trusty to the ends as it was with king henry the seventh of england who in his greatest business imparted himself to none except it were to morton and fox 
 
 for weakening of authority the fable showeth the remedy nay the majesty of kings is rather exalted than diminished when they are in the chair of counsel neither was there ever prince bereaved of his dependencies by his counsel except where there hath been either an overgreatness in one counsellor or an overstrict combination in divers which are things soon found and holpen 
 
 for the last inconvenience that men will counsel with an eye to themselves certainly non inveniet fidem super terrain is meant of the nature of times and not of all particular persons there be that are in nature faithful and sincere and plain and direct not crafty and involved let princes above all draw to themselves such natures besides counsellors are not commonly so united but that one counsellor keepeth sentinel over another so that if any do counsel out of faction or private ends it commonly comes to the ear but the best remedy is if princes know their counsellors as well as their counsellors know them principis est virtus maxima nosse suos 
 
 and on the other side counsellors should not be too speculative into their 
 person the true composition of a counsellor is rather to be skilful 
 in their business than in his nature for then he is like to advise him 
 and not to feed his humour it is of singular use to princes if they take the opinions of their counsel both separately and together 
 for private opinion is more free but opinion before others is more reverend in private men are more bold in their own humours and in consort men are more obnoxious to others humours therefore it is good to take both and of the inferior sort rather in private to preserve freedom of the greater rather in consort to preserve respect it is in vain for princes to take counsel concerning matters if they take no counsel likewise concerning persons for all matters are as dead images and me life of the execution of affairs resteth in the good choice of persons neither is it enough to consult concerning persons secundurn genera as in an idea or mathematical description what the kind and 
 character of the person should be for the greatest errors are committed and the 
 most judgement is shown in the choice of individuals it was truly said 
 optimi consiliarii maud books will speak plain when counsellors blanch 
 therefore it is good to be conversant in them specially the books of such as themselves have been actors upon me stage 
 
 the counsels at this day in most places are but familiar meetings 
 where matters are rather talked on than debated and they run too swift to the order or act of counsel it were better that in causes of weight the matter were propounded one day and not spoken to till the next day in nocte consilium so was it done in die commission of union between england and scotland which was a grave and orderly assembly i commend set days for petitions for both it gives the suitors more certainty for their attendance and it frees the meetings for matters of estate that they may hoc agere in choice of committees for ripening business for the counsel it is better to choose indifferent persons than to make an indifference by putting in those that are strong on both sides i commend also standing commissions as for trade for treasure for war for suits for some provinces for where there be divers particular counsels and but one counsel of estate as it is in spain they are in effect no more than standing commissions save that they have greater authority let such as are to inform counsels out of their particular professions as lawyers seamen mintmen and the like be first heard before committees and then as occasion serves before the counsel 
 and let them not come in multitudes or in a tribunitious manner for that is to clamour counsels not to inform them a long table and a square table or seats about the walls seem things of form but are things of substance for at a long table a few at the upper end in effect sway all the business but in the other form there is more use of the counsellors opinions that sit lower 
 
 a king when he presides in counsel let him beware how he opens his own inclination too much in that which he propounded for else counsellors will but take the wind of him and instead of giving free counsel sing him a song of placebo

 tranquillity 
 after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him 
 monsieur i will conduct you to your room 
 the man followed him 
 as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bedroom 
 at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed this was her last care every evening before she went to bed 
 the bishop installed his guest in the alcove 
 a fresh white bed had been prepared there 
 the man set the candle down on a small table 
 well said the bishop may you pass a good night 
 morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows 
 thanks monsieur said the man 
 hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it 
 even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment 
 did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace 
 was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice 
 ah really 
 you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this 
 he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous 
 have you really reflected well 
 how do you know that i have not been an assassin 
 the bishop replied 
 that is the concern of the good god 
 then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head or looking behind him he returned to his bedroom 
 when the alcove was in use a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar 
 the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer 
 a moment later he was in his garden walking meditating conteplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the eyes which remain open 
 as for the man he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets 
 snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep 
 midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment 
 a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house

 the empire strikes back 
 vi 
 
 the rebel command center its walls and ceiling still shaking and cracking under theforce of the battle on the surface was attempting to operate amid the torn apart by the blasting belched sprays of scalding stem the white floorwere littered with broken pieces of machinery and chunks of ice were scatteredeverywhere except for the distant rumbling of laser fire the command center wasforebodingly quiet 
 there were still rebel personnel on duty including princess leia who watchedthe images on the few console screens she wanted to be certainthat the last of the transport ships had slipped past the imperial armada and wereapproaching their rendezvous point in space 
 han solo rushed into the command center dodging great sections of the iceceiling that came plunging down at him one great chunk was followed by anavalanche of ice that poured onto the floor near the entrance to the han hurried to the control board where leia stood beside 
 i heard the command center was hit han appeared concerned are you allright 
 the princess nodded she was surprised to see him there where the danger wasseverest 
 come on he urged before she could reply got to get to your ship 
 leia looked exhausted she had been standing at the console viewscreens forhours and had participated in dispatching rebel personnel to their posts taking herhand han led her from the chamber with the protocol droid clacking after them 
 as they left leia gave one final order to the controller give the evacuationcode signaland get to the transport 
 then as leia han and threepio made their hasty exit from the command voice blared from the public address speakers echoing in the nearby deserted icecorridors disengage disengage begin retreat action 
 come on han urged grimacing if you get there fast your be able to take off 
 the walls quaked even more violently than before ice chunks continued to fallthroughout the underground base as the three hurried toward the transport had nearly reached the hangar where transport ship was waiting ready fordeparture but as they neared the corner they found the entrance to the hangarcompletely blocked by ice and snow 
 han knew they would have to find some other route to escape he began to lead them back down the corridor careful to avoid falling snapped on his comlink as they hurried toward the ship transport c oneseven he yelled into the small microphone coming hold on 
 they were close enough to the hangar to hear escape vessel preparing from the rebel ice base if he could lead them safely just a few meters princess would be safe and 
 the chamber suddenly quaked with a terrible noise that thundered through theunderground base in an instant the entire ceiling had crashed down in front of a solid barrier of ice between them and the hangar docks they stared inshock at the dense white mass 
 cut off han yelled into his comlink knowing that if the transport wereto make good its escape there could be no time wasted in melting down or blastingthrough the barricade have to take off without princess organa heturned to her if lucky we can still make it to the falcon 
 the princess and followed as han dashed toward another that the millennium falcon and his wookiee copilot had not already beenburied under an avalanche of ice 
 looking out across the white battlefield the rebel officer watched the remainingsnowspeeders whisking through the air and the last of the imperial vehicles as theypassed the wreckage of the exploded walker he flipped on his comlink and heardthe order to retreat disengage disengage begin retreat action as he signaledhis men to move back inside the ice cavern he noticed that the lead walker was stilltreading heavily in the direction of the power generators 
 in the cockpit of that assault machine general veers stepped close to the this position he could clearly see the target below he studied the cracklingpower generators and observed the rebel troops defending them 
 within range sir reported hispilot 
 the general turned to his assault officer all troops will debark for groundassault veers said prepare to target the main generator 
 the lead walker flanked by two of the hulking machines lurched forward itsguns blazing to scatter the retreating rebel troops 
 as more laser fire came from the oncoming walkers rebel bodies and parts ofrebel bodies were flung through the air many of the soldiers who had managed toavoid the obliterating laser beams were crushed into unrecognizable pulp beneath thewalkers stomping feet the air was charged with the stink of blood and burningflesh and thundering with the explosive noises of battle 
 as they fled the few surviving rebel soldiers glimpsed a long snowspeeder as itretreated in the distance a black trail of smoke escaping its burning hull 
 although the smoke rising from his crippled speeder obstructed his view hobbiecould still see some of the carnage that raged on the ground his wounds from laser fire made it torture even to move let alone operate the controls of hiscraft but if he could mange to work them just long enough to return to the base hemight be able to find a medical robot and 
 no he doubted he would survive even that long he was that he wasnow the men in the trench would soon be dead too unless somethingwere done to save them 
 general veers proudly transmitting his report to imperial headquarters wastotally unaware of rogue approach yes lord vader reached the mainpower generators the shield will be down in moments you may commence yourlanding 
 as he ended his transmission general veers reached for the electrorangefinderand looked through the eyepiece to line up the main power generators electroniccrosshairs aligned according to the information from the computer thensuddenly the readouts on the small monitor screens mysteriously vanished 
 confounded general veers moved away from the eyepiece of theelectrorangefinder and turned instinctively toward a cockpit window he flinched interror at seeing a smoking projectile heading on the direct course toward his 
 the other pilots also saw the hurtling speeder and knew that there was no timeto turn the massive assault machine going to one of the pilots began 
 at that instant burning ship crashed through the walker cockpit like amanned bomb its fuel igniting into a cascade of flame and debris for a secondthere were human screams then fragments and the entire machine crashed to theground 
 perhaps it was the sound of this nearby blast that jarred luke skywalker back toconsciousness dazed he slowly lifted his head from the snow he felt very weakand was achingly stiff with cold the thought crossed his mind that frostbite mightalready have damaged his tissues he hoped not he had no desire to spend any moretime in that sticky bacta fluid 
 he tried to stand but fell back against the snow hoping he would not be spottedby any of the walker pilots his comlink whistled and somehow he found thestrength to flick on its receiver 
 forward units withdrawal complete the broadcast voice reported 
 withdrawal luke thought a moment then leia and the others must haveescaped luke suddenly felt that all the fighting and the deaths of loyal rebelpersonnel had not been for nothing a warmth rushed through his body and hegathered his strength to rise and begin making the long trek back toward a distantformation of ice 
 another explosion rocked the rebel hangar deck cracking the ceiling and almostburying the docked millennium falcon in a mound of ice at any moment the entireceiling might cave in the only safe place in the hangar seemed to be underneath theship itself where chewbacca was impatiently awaiting the return of his captain thewookiee had begun to worry if han did not return soon the falcon would surelybe buried in a tomb of ice but loyalty to his partner kept chewie from taking off inthe freighter alone 
 as the hangar started to tremble more violently chewbacca detected movementin the adjoining chamber throwing back his head the shaggy giant filled thehangar with his loudest roar as he saw han solo climb over hills of ice and snow andenter the chamber followed closely by princess leia and an obviously 
 not far from the hangar imperial stormtroopers their faces shielded by whitehelmets and white snowscreens had begun moving down deserted corridors withthem strode their leader the figure who surveyed the shambles that hadbeen the rebel base at hoth darth black image stood out starkly against thewhite walls ceiling and floor as he moved through the white catacombs heregally stepped aside to avoid a falling section of ice ceiling then he continued onhis way with such quick strides that his troops had to hurry to keep up 
 a low whine rising in pitch began to issue from the solo stood at the controls in the millennium cockpit at last feeling athome he quickly flipped one switch after another expecting to see the board flashits familiar mosaic of light but only some of the lights were working 
 chewbacca had also noticed something amiss and barked with concern as leiaexamined a gauge that seemed to be malfunctioning 
 that chewie asked han anxiously 
 the bark was distinctly negative 
 would it help if i got out and pushed snapped princess leia who wasbeginning to wonder if it were the spit that held the ship together 
 worry your holiness get it started 
 clanked into the hold and gesturing tried to get the robot volunteered i was wondering if i might but his scanners readthe scowl on the face staring at him it can wait he concluded 
 imperial stormtroopers accompanied by the rapidly moving darth through the ice corridors of the rebel base their pace quickened as theyrushed in the direction of the low whine coming from the ion engines bodytensed slightly as entering the hangar he perceived the familiar formof the millennium falcon 
 within the battered freighter ship han solo and chewbacca were tryingdesperately to get the craft moving 
 this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade princess leiacomplained 
 han pretended that he hear her instead he checked the and struggled to keep his patience even though his companion had soobviously lost hers he flipped switches on the control console ignoring look of disdain clearly she doubted that this assemblage of spare partsand welded hunks of scrap metal would hold together even if they did manage to getbeyond the blockade 
 han pushed a button on the intercom chewiecome on then winking atleia he said this still got a few surprise left in her 
 be surprised if we start moving 
 before han could make a carefully honed retort the falcon was jolted by a blastof imperial laser fire that flashed outside the cockpit window they could all see thesquad of imperial stormtroopers rushing with drawn weapons into the far end of theice hangar han knew that the dented hull might resist the force of thosehand weapons but would be destroyed by the more powerful weaponthat two of the imperial troopers were hurriedly setting up 
 chewie han yelled as he quickly strapped himself into his a somewhat subdued young woman seated herself in the 
 outside the millennium falcon stormtroopers worked with military efficiency toset up their enormous gun behind them the hangar doors began to open one ofthe powerful laser weapons appeared from the hull and swung about aimingdirectly at the stormtroopers 
 han moved urgently to block the imperial efforts without hesitationhe released a deadly blast from the powerful laser weapon he had aimed at thestormtroopers the explosion scattered their armored bodies all over the hangar 
 chewbacca dashed into the cockpit 
 just have to switch over han announced and hope for the best 
 the wookiee hurled his hairy bulk into the seat as yet another laserblast erupted outside the window next to him he yelled indignantly then yankedback on the controls to bring the welcome roar of engine fire from deep inside thefalcon 
 the corellian grinned at the princess a gleeful gleam in his eyes 
 someday she said with mild disgust going to be wrong and i justhope there to see it 
 han just smiled then turned to his copilot punch it he shouted 
 the huge engines roared and everything behind the craft instantlymelted in the fiery exhaust billowing from its tailpiece chewbacca furiously workedthe controls watching out of the corner of his eyes the ice walls rushing past as thefreighter blasted away 
 at the last moment just before takeoff han caught a glimpse of additionalstormtroopers running into the hangar in their wake strode a foreboding giant cladentirely in black then there was only the blur and the beckoning of billions of stars 
 as the millennium falcon soared from the hangar its flight was detected bycommander luke skywalker who turned to smile at wedge and his gunner atleast han got away the three then trudged along to their waiting fighterships when they finally reached them they shook hands and moved off towardtheir separate vehicles 
 good luck luke wedge said as they parted see you at the rendezvous 
 luke waved and began to walk toward his standing there amid themountains of ice and snow he was overcome by a surge of loneliness he feltdesperately alone now that even han was gone worse than that princess leia wasalso somewhere else she might just as well be an entire universe away 
 then out of nowhere a familiar whistle greeted luke 
 artoo he exclaimed is that you 
 sitting snugly in the socket that had been installed for these helpful r units wasthe little droid his head peeking from the top of the ship artoo hadscanned the approaching figure and had whistled with relief when his computersinformed him it was luke the young commander was equally relieved toreencounter the robot that had accompanied him on so many of his previousadventures 
 as he climbed into the cockpit and seated himself behind the controls lukecould hear the sound of fighter roaring into the sky toward the rebelrendezvous point activate the power and stop worrying soon beairborne luke said in response to nervous beeping 
 his was the last rebel ship to abandon what had for a very brief time been asecret outpost in the revolution against the tyranny of the empire 
 darth vader a raven specter quickly strode through the ruins of the rebel icefortress forcing his accompanying men into a brisk jog to keep up as they movedthrough the corridors admiral piett rushed up to overtake his master 
 seventeen ships destroyed he reported to the dark lord we knowhow many got away 
 without turning his head vader snarled through his mask the millenniumfalcon 
 piett paused a moment before replying he would have preferred to avoid thatissue our tracking scanners are on it now he responded a bit fearfully 
 vader turned to face the admiral his towering figure looming over the frightenedofficer piett felt a chill course through his veins and when the dark lord spokeagain his voice conveyed an image of the dreadful fate that would be inflicted if hiscommands were not executed 
 i want that ship he hissed 
 the ice planet was rapidly shrinking to a point of dim light as the millenniumfalcon sped into space soon that planet seemed nothing more than one of thebillions of light specks scattered throughout the black void 
 but the falcon was not alone in its escape into deep space rather it wasfollowed by an imperial fleet that included the avenger star destroyer and tie fighter the fighters moved ahead of the huge and closed in on the fleeing millennium falcon 
 chewbacca howled over the roar of the engines the ship wasbeginning to lurch with the buffeting flak blasted at it by the fighters 
 i know i know i see them han shouted it was taking everything he had tomaintain control of the ship 
 see what leia asked 
 han pointed out the window at two very bright objects 
 two more star destroyers and heading right at us 
 glad you said there was going to be no problem she commented withmore than a touch of sarcasm or be worried 
 the ship rocked under the steady fire from the tie fighters making it difficult forthreepio to maintain his balance as he returned to the cockpit his metal skinbumped and banged against the walls as he approached han sir he begantentatively i was wondering 
 han solo shot him a threatening glance either shut up or shut down hanwarned the robot who immediately did the former 
 still struggling with the controls to keep the millennium falcon on course thepilot turned to wookiee chewie the deflector shield holding up 
 the cockpit adjusted an overhead switch and barked a reply that solo interpretedas positive 
 good said han at sublight they may be faster but we can them hold on suddenly the corellian shifted his course 
 the two imperial star destroyers had com almost within firing range of thefalcon as they loomed ahead the pursuing tie fighters and the avenger were alsodangerously close han felt he had no choice but to take the falcon into dive 
 leia and chewbacca felt their stomachs leap into their throats as the falconexecuted its steep dive poor threepio quickly had to alter his inner mechanism if hewanted to remain on his metallic fee 
 han realized that his crew might think he was some kind of lunatic star his ship on this course but he had a strategy in mind with thefalcon no longer between them the two star destroyers were now on a directcollision course with the avenger all he had to do was sit back and watch 
 alarms blared through the interiors of all three star destroyers theseponderously massive ships could not respond quickly enough to such one of the destroyers began to move to the left in its effort to avoidcollision with the avenger unfortunately as it veered it brushed its companion shaking up both spaceborne fortresses the damaged destroyers began todrift through space while the avenger continued in pursuit of the millennium falconand its obviously insane pilot 
 two down han thought but there was still a quartet of tie fighters tailing thefalcon blasting at its stern with full laser fire but han thought he could outstrip ship was buffeted violently by the fighters laser blasts forcing leia to hold on ina desperate attempt to keep her seat 
 that slowed them down a bit han exulted chewie stand by to make thejump to there was not a moment to laser attack wasintense now and the tie fighters were almost on top of them 
 very close leia warned finally able to speak 
 han looked at her with a wicked glint in his eyes oh yeah watch this 
 he threw the hyperspace throttle forward desperate to escape but also eager toimpress the princess with both his own cleverness and his fantastic happened the stars that should by then have been mere blurs of light werestill something was definitely wrong 
 watch what leia asked impatiently 
 instead of responding han worked the controls a second nothing i think in trouble he muttered his throat tightened heknew trouble was a gross understatement 
 if i may say so sir threepio volunteered i noticed earlier that the entiremain system seemed to have been damaged 
 chewbacca threw back his head and let out a loud and miserable wail 
 in trouble han repeated 
 all around them the laser attack had increased violently the millenniumfalcon could only continue at its maximum sublight velocity as it moved deeper intospace closely followed by a swarm of tie fighters and one gigantic imperial stardestroyer

 book one 
 chapter xx 
 
 the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the sitting room some in the library 
 the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual nap and laughed at everything the young people at the countess instigation gathered round the clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and 
 nicholas who were noted for their musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated as though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy 
 what shall we sing she said 
 the brook suggested nicholas 
 well be quick boris come here said natasha but where is sonya 
 she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her 
 running into room and not finding her there natasha ran to the nursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on dirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook face which had been so radiantly happy all that day suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped 
 sonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya was crying sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face still deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on the feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining 
 nicholas is going away in a time his papers have come he told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had written still i should not cry but you no one can understand what a soul he has 
 and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul 
 all very well for you i am not envious i love you and boris also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it be done and besides if she tells mamma sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so that i am spoiling nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my witness and she made the sign of the cross i love her so much and all of you only vera and what for what have i done to her i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing 
 sonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed natasha began consoling her but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her trouble 
 sonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason of her sorrow sure vera has said something to you since dinner she 
 yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others and she found them on my table and said show them to mamma and that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry me but that marry julie you see how been with her all day natasha what have i done to deserve it 
 and again she began to sob more bitterly than before natasha lifted her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting her 
 sonya believe her darling believe her do you remember how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after supper why we settled how everything was to be i quite remember how but you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was uncle brother has married his first cousin and we are only second cousins you know and boris says it is quite possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so clever and so good said natasha you cry sonya dear love darling sonya and she kissed her and laughed spiteful never mind her and all will come right and she say anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself and he care at all for julie 
 natasha kissed her on the hair 
 sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should 
 do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and hair 
 really truly answered natasha pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her plaits 
 both laughed 
 well go and sing the brook 
 come along 
 do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said natasha stopping suddenly i feel so happy 
 and she set off at a run along the passage 
 sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then nicholas sang a song he had just learned 
 at nighttime in the fair glow 
 how sweet as fancies wander free 
 to feel that in this world one 
 who still is thinking but of thee 
 that while her fingers touch the harp 
 wafting sweet music music the lea 
 it is for thee thus swells her heart 
 sighing its message out to thee 
 a day or two then bliss unspoilt 
 but oh till then i cannot live 
 he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery 
 pierre was sitting in the where shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing 
 mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers 
 i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl 
 while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a man who had been abroad she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a lady she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and smiling over the fan 
 dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to natasha 
 natasha blushed and laughed 
 well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at 
 in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came marya dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violin 
 semen do you know the daniel cooper 
 this was the favorite dance which he had danced in his youth strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise 
 look at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 
 and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry 
 just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the nurse as she stood in one of the doorways 
 the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole of the plump figure in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round marya dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs 
 how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count 
 that was a daniel cooper exclaimed marya dmitrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily

 chapter 
 
 to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr linton commissioned me to take the boy home early on pony and said he as we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us 
 linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey 
 my father he cried in strange perplexity mamma never told me i had a father where does he live rather stay with uncle 
 he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty and you should be glad to go home and to see him you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you 
 but why have i not heard of him before asked linton why mamma and he live together as other people do 
 he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your health required her to reside in the south 
 and why mamma speak to me about him persevered the child she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago how am i to love papa i know him 
 oh all children love their parents i said your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you let us make haste an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an more sleep 
 is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday replied i 
 is uncle he continued 
 no i shall be your companion there i said 
 linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study 
 i go without uncle he cried at length i tell where you mean to take me 
 i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my assistance in coaxing him out of bed the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr edgar and cathy would visit him and other promises equally which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way the pure air and the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness 
 is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue 
 it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for and dryer you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood and you will have such nice rambles on the moors hareton is miss other cousin and so yours in a show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills 
 and what is my father like he asked is he as young and handsome as uncle 
 as young said i but he has black hair and eyes and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own 
 black hair and eyes mused linton i fancy him then i am not like him am i 
 not much i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eyes save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit 
 how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me he murmured has he ever seen me if he have i must have been a baby i remember not a single thing about him 
 why master linton said i three hundred miles is a great distance and ten years seem very different in length to a person compared with what they do to you it is probable mr heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good 
 the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance he surveyed the carved front and lattices the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within before he dismounted i went and opened the door it was half past six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table joseph stood by his chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton was preparing for the hay field 
 hallo nelly cried mr heathcliff when he saw me i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself brought it have you let us see what we can make of it 
 he got up and strode to the door hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three 
 said joseph after a grave inspection swopped wi ye maister an his lass 
 heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh 
 god what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly oh damn my soul but worse than i the devil knows i was not sanguine 
 i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept 
 tut tut said heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin none of that nonsense not going to hurt thee that thy name thou art thy child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken 
 he took off the cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination linton ceased crying and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector 
 do you know me asked heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble 
 no said linton with a gaze of vacant fear 
 heard of me i dare say 
 no he replied again 
 no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me you are my son then tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed now wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood be a good lad and do for you nelly if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again i guess report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing be settled while you linger about it 
 well replied i i hope be kind to the boy mr heathcliff or not keep him long and all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever 
 be very kind to him you fear he said laughing only nobody else must be kind to him jealous of monopolizing his affection and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast hareton you infernal calf begone to your work yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor besides mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their children to till their lands for wages that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives but that consideration is sufficient as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own i have a room upstairs furnished for him in handsome style engaged a tutor also to come three times a week from twenty miles distance to teach him what he pleases to learn ordered hareton to obey him and in fact arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and bitterly disappointed with the whining wretch 
 while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge and placed it before linton he stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it i saw the old manservant shared largely in his scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour 
 cannot ate it repeated he peering in face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard but maister hareton nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what were gooid eneugh for gooid eneugh for ye rayther think 
 i eat it answered linton snappishly take it away joseph snatched up the food indignantly and brought it to us is there aught ails th victuals he asked thrusting the tray under nose 
 what should ail them he said 
 wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em but aw guess raight his mother wer just wer too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead 
 mention his mother to me said the master angrily get him something that he can eat all what is his usual food nelly 
 i suggested boiled milk or tea and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some come i reflected his selfishness may contribute to his comfort he perceives his delicate constitution and the necessity of treating him tolerably console mr edgar by acquainting him with the turn humour has taken having no excuse for lingering longer i slipped out while linton was engaged in timidly rebuilding the advances of a friendly sheepdog but he was too much on the alert to be cheated as i closed the door i heard a cry and a frantic repetition of the words 
 leave me not stay here not stay here 
 then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended

 chapter twenty 
 
 i think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep 
 hannah had dished up and astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of state mr promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold 
 
 what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity 
 after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by cry of joy at sight of her mother 
 there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her 
 
 on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this 
 
 yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which tried to make the face is not good too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i seem so far away and that helps me 
 as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as too big like to wear them mother can i 
 they are very pretty but i think rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together 
 try not to be vain said amy i think i like it only because so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something 
 do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing 
 no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan 
 thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so going to try hard to cure it if i can beth selfish and the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people feel so bat about me if i was sick and i deserve to have them but like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so going to try and be like beth all i can apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may we try this way 
 yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again 
 that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look 
 what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence 
 i want to tell you something mother 
 about meg 
 how quickly you guessed yes about her and though a little thing it fidgets me 
 beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply 
 no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr brooke owned that he liked meg but dare say so she was so young and he so poor now it a dreadful state of things 
 do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look 
 mercy me i know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing faintingaway growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not doanything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he mind me as he ought 
 then you fancy that meg is not interested in john 
 who cried jo staring 
 mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it 
 oh dear i know take his part been good to father and you send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak 
 my dear get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr request and was so devoted to poor father that we help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to engaging herself so young 
 of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family 
 this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him 
 see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and think john an ugly name and go and fall in love and an end of peace and fun and cozy times together i see it all go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why we all boys then there be any bother 
 jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief 
 you like it mother glad of it send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been 
 i did wrong to sigh jo it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly my pretty tender hearted girl i hope things will go happily with her 
 you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her voice faltered a little over the last words 
 money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly not be tempted by too much i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good heart and that is better than a fortune 
 i understand mother and quite agree but disappointed about meg for planned to have her marry teddy and sit in the lap of luxury all her days it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face 
 he is younger than she you know began mrs march but jo broke in 
 only a little old for his age and tall and can be quite in his manners if he likes then rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say a pity my plan is spoiled 
 afraid laurie is hardly enough for meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends we meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship 
 well i but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull her and a snip there would straighten it out i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up but buds will be roses and kittens cats the pity 
 that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand 
 only one of my stupid speeches going to bed come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle 
 quite right and beautifully written please add that i send my love to john said mrs march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back 
 do you call him john asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her 
 yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied mrs march returning the look with a keen one 
 glad of that he is so lonely good night mother dear it is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was answer 
 the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away mrs march said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret she does not love john yet but will soon learn to

 ext roof matrix day 
 the tower is now engulfed in flames as neo 
 and trinity lay waste to a dozen more marines 
 guns and knives like extensions of their bodies used 
 with the same deadly precision as their feet and their 
 fists 
 across the roof the pilot inside the army helicopter 
 watches the ferocious onslaught 
 pilot 
 i repeat we are under attack 
 suddenly his face his whole body dissolves consumed by 
 spreading swarm of static as 
 agent jones emerges 
 just as she drops the last marine trinity sees 
 coming 
 neo sees her the fear in her face and he knows what is 
 behind him 
 screaming he whirls guns filling his hands with 
 
 fingers pumping shells ejecting dancing up and away we 
 look through the sights and gun smoke at 
 the agent blurred with motion 
 until the hammers click against empty metal 
 neo 
 trinity 
 agent jones charges 
 neo 
 help 
 his gun booms as we enter the liquid space of 
 
 the air sizzles with wads of angry flies as neo 
 twists bends ducks just between them 
 agent jones still running narrows the gap the bullets 
 coming faster until 
 neo bent impossibly back one hand on the ground as a 
 spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder 
 he starts to scream as another digs a red groove across 
 his thigh 
 he has only time to look up to see the barrel when agent 
 jones standing over him pulls the trigger the final 
 time 
 click empty 
 neo rolls reaching for another gun when 
 kick snaps his jaw agent jones grabs the gun and levels 
 it at neo 
 agent jones 
 only human 
 suddenly agent jones stops something is wrong he 
 scans the roof trinity is gone 
 immediately he whirls around and turns straight into the 
 muzzle of her 
 jammed right into his head 
 trinity 
 dodge this motherfucker 
 boom boom boom the body flies back with a flash of 
 mercurial light and when it hits the ground 
 it is the pilot 
 trinity helps neo up 
 neo 
 thanks 
 trinity 
 hit 
 neo 
 fine 
 neo is already looking at the helicopter 
 neo 
 can you fly that thing 
 trinity

 she pulls out a cellular phone

 his fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks finding 
 one that he feeds into trinityls supplement drive 
 punching the load cormands on her keyboard 
 
 ext roof matrix day 
 eyes flutter as information surges into her 
 brain all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed 
 at

 go 
 
 int hall matrix day 
 marines trying to communicate with the men on the roof 
 are beginning to panic when agent jones comes around the 
 corner 
 sergeant 
 sir sir there was gunfire 
 lost communication with the roof 
 agent jones 
 remain at your posts 
 sergeant 
 but sir the fire we should evacuate 
 agent jones 
 you will do as you are ordered 
 sergeant 
 yes sir 
 agent jones marches into the presidential suite 
 
 int presidential suite matrix day 
 agent jones throws open the bedroom door and enters 
 walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet 
 over the rushing water and the alarms agent smith hears 
 a sound and understands the seriousness of the attack 
 he turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops 
 into view 
 neo is in the back bay aiming the mounted machine 
 gun 
 agent smith 
 no 
 the gun jumps and bullets explode through the window in a cacophony of crashing glass 
 as the agents go for their weapons 
 but neo is too close the caliber too fast and 
 bullets are everywhere perforating the room 
 agent smith is hit first his body back 
 blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light 
 then agent brown his gun still firing as his body falls 
 and finally agent jones 
 neo stares at morpheus trying to will him into action 
 neo 
 get up morpheus get up 
 morpheus sits unmoving his head still down 
 neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into 
 the adjoining room 
 he attaches only one end to his harness when they open 
 fire 
 quickly he swings the gun spraying the other room 
 windows shattering furniture exploding marines diving for cover 
 
 int hall matrix day 
 just outside the presidential suite three marines 
 blister with 
 
 int presidential suite matrix day 
 morpheus lifts his face into the rain his eyes 
 still white begin to blink twitch then close 
 and when he opens them they are again dark and flashing 
 with fire 
 the agents knife into the room firing even as 
 bullet trails chase them 
 morpheus strains at his handcuffs 
 the agents and the marines turn the tide blasting lead 
 ricocheting the copter 
 firing wildly neo turns to see morpheus rising snapping 
 the handcuffs starting for the window 
 agent smith stops and sees morpheus run past the open 
 bedroom door 
 agent smith 
 nooo 
 he fires sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a 
 perfect line 
 for an instant we see the bullets shred puncturing the 
 wall searing through the wet air with jet trails of 
 chalk 
 and as morpheus starts to dive for the window a bullet 
 buries itself in his leg 
 knocking him off balance 
 neo 
 he make it 
 morpheus lunges out of control 
 as neo spins every move a whip crack 
 snapping the other onto a bolted bar 
 morpheus begins to fall when neo hurls himself into the 
 wide blue empty space 
 flying for a moment 
 the rope snaking out behind him an umbilical cord 
 attached to a machine 
 as their two bodies set in motion rushing at each other 
 on a seemingly magnetic course until 
 they collide 
 almost bouncing free of each other arms legs 
 scrambling hands searching in furious desperation 
 finding hold and clinging 
 until the line ends snapping taut cracking their 
 fragile embrace morpheus tumbles legs flipping over 
 falling down 
 the ground deliriously distant 
 as neo snatches hold of his still handcuffed wrist 
 neo 
 gotcha 
 trinity is already pulling the copter up and away 
 as agent smith grabs the m from the nearest marine 
 bring them all down targeting the helicopter he 
 aims at something only he can see the oil line 
 ponk ponk ponk the rear hull is punched full of 
 holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood 
 trinity 
 
 neo is pulling morpheus up to him when he hears the 
 helicopter begin to die 
 neo 
 oh fuck 
 trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the 
 nearest building 
 morpheus and neo cling to one another as they and the 
 machine above them begin to fall 
 the engine grinds the chopping blades start to slow 
 while 
 the agents stand in the open shattered window watching 
 the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings 
 carried by its nomentum trinity guides the parabolic 
 fall over the nearest roof where 
 neo and morpheus drop safely rolling free as the rope 
 goes slack neo gets to his feet trying to detach 
 himself but 
 the helicopter is falling too fast arcing over the roof 
 like a setting sun 
 the coils of slack snap taught 
 yanking neo off his feet dragging him with ferocious 
 speed towards the edge even as 
 trinity lunges for the back door her gun in one hand 
 grabbing for the rope with the other 
 neo flies like a skipping stone hurtling straight at us 
 when his feet hit the rain gutter 
 a fulcrum that levers him up just as 
 trinity fires severing the cord from the helicopter 
 falling free of it as it smashes blades first into a 
 glass skyscraper 
 holding onto the rope she swings connected to neo who 
 stands on the edge watching her arc beneath 
 him as the helicopter explodes 
 she bounces against a shatterproof window that spider 
 cracks out while flames erupt behind her
