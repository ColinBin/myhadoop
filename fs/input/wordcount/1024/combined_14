 harry awoke at five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses mrs weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggered 
 
 ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir as harry crossed the room stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying not to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow students at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stairs past the heads of ancestors and down into the kitchen 
 
 he had expected it to be empty but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side he pushed it open and saw mr and mrs weasley sirius lupin and tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him all were fully dressed except mrs weasley who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown she leapt to her feet the moment harry entered 
 
 breakfast she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire 
 
 harry yawned tonks her hair was blonde and curly this morning sleep all right 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down 
 
 she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it in the process 
 
 what do you want harry mrs weasley called porridge muffins kippers bacon and eggs toast 
 
 justjust toast thanks said harry 
 
 lupin glanced at harry then said to tonks what were you saying about scrimgeour 
 
 oh yeah well we need to be a bit more careful been asking kingsley and me funny questions 
 
 harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation his insides were squirming mrs weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him he tried to eat but it was like chewing carpet mrs weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders he wished she 
 
 and have to tell dumbledore i do night duty tomorrow just tired tonks finished yawning hugely again 
 
 cover for you said mr weasley ok got a report to finish anyway 
 
 mr weasley was not wearing wizards robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket he turned from tonks to harry 
 
 how are you feeling 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 all be over soon mr weasley said bracingly in a few hours time be cleared 
 
 harry said nothing 
 
 the on my floor in amelia office head of the department of magical law enforcement and the one be questioning you 
 
 amelia bones is ok harry said tonks earnestly fair hear you out 
 
 harry nodded still unable to think of anything to say 
 
 lose your temper said sirius abruptly be polite and stick to the facts 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 the on your side said lupin quietly even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in situations 
 
 something very cold trickled down the back of neck for a moment he thought someone was putting a disillusionment charm on him then he realised that mrs weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb she pressed hard on the top of his head 
 
 it ever lie flat she said desperately 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 mr weasley checked his watch and looked up at harry i think go now he said a bit early but i think be better off at the ministry than hanging around here 
 
 ok said harry automatically dropping his toast and getting to his feet 
 
 be all right harry said tonks patting him on the arm 
 
 good luck said lupin sure it will be fine 
 
 and if not said sirius grimly see to amelia bones for you 
 
 harry smiled weakly mrs weasley hugged him 
 
 all got our fingers crossed she said 
 
 right said harry well see you later then 
 
 he followed mr weasley upstairs and along the hall he could hear mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains mr weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold grey dawn 
 
 you normally walk to work do you harry asked him as they set off briskly around the square 
 
 no i usually apparate said mr weasley but obviously you and i think best we arrive in a thoroughly fashion makes a better impression given what being disciplined for 
 
 mr weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked harry knew it was clenched around his wand the streets were almost deserted but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of commuters as ever when he found himself in close proximity to muggles going about their daily business mr weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm 
 
 simply fabulous he whispered indicating the automatic ticket machines wonderfully ingenious 
 
 out of order said harry pointing at the sign 
 
 yes but even so said mr weasley beaming at them fondly 
 
 they bought their tickets instead from a guard harry handled the transaction as mr weasley was not very good with muggle money and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of london mr weasley kept anxiously checking and the underground map above the windows 
 
 four stops harry three stops left now two stops to go harry 
 
 they got off at a station in the very heart of london and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases up the escalator they went through the ticket barrier mr weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket and emerged on to a broad street lined with buildings and already full of traffic 
 
 where are we said mr weasley blankly and for one moment harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite mr continual references to the map but a second later he said ah yes this way harry and led him down a side road 
 
 sorry he said but i never come by train and it all looks rather different from a muggle perspective as a matter of fact never even used the visitors entrance before 
 
 the further they walked the smaller and less imposing the buildings became until finally they reached a street that contained several rather offices a pub and an overflowing skip harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the ministry of magic 
 
 here we are said mr weasley brightly pointing at an old red telephone box which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall after you harry 
 
 he opened the door 
 
 harry stepped inside wondering what on earth this was about mr weasley folded himself in beside harry and closed the door it was a tight fit harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off mr weasley reached past harry for the receiver 
 
 mr weasley i think this might be out of order too harry said 
 
 no no sure its fine said mr weasley holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial see six he dialled the number two four and another four and another two 
 
 as the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr hand but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 er said mr weasley clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear arthur weasley misuse of muggle artefacts office here to escort harry potter who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes 
 
 there was a click and a rattle and harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared he picked it up it was a square silver badge with harry potter disciplinary hearing on it he pinned it to the front of his as the female voice spoke again 
 
 visitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered they were sinking slowly into the ground harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads then he could see nothing at all he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth after about a minute though it felt much longer to harry a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and widening rose up his body until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant day said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box sprang open and mr weasley stepped out of it followed by harry whose mouth had fallen open 
 
 they were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished dark wood floor the peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard the on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the fireplaces with a soft whoosh on the side short queues were forming before each fireplace waiting to depart 
 
 halfway down the hall was a fountain a group of golden statues larger than stood in the middle of a circular pool tallest of them all was a wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air grouped around him were a beautiful witch a centaur a goblin and a the last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and each of the ears so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards most of whom were wearing glum looks strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall 
 
 this way said mr weasley 
 
 they joined the throng wending their way between the ministry workers some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment others battered briefcases still others were reading the daily prophet while they walked as they passed the fountain harry saw silver sickles and bronze knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool a small smudged sign beside it read 
 
 all proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries 
 
 if not expelled from hogwarts put in ten galleons harry found himself thinking desperately 
 
 over here harry said mr weasley and they stepped out of the stream of ministry employees heading for the golden gates seated at a desk to the left beneath a sign saying security a wizard in robes looked up as they approached and put down his daily prophet 
 
 escorting a visitor said mr weasley gesturing towards harry 
 
 step over here said the wizard in a bored voice 
 
 harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod thin and flexible as a car aerial and passed it up and down front and back 
 
 wand grunted the security wizard at harry putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand 
 
 harry produced his wand the wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish it began to vibrate a narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base the wizard tore this off and read the writing on it 
 
 eleven inches core been in use four years that correct 
 
 yes said harry nervously 
 
 i keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harry 
 
 thank you 
 
 hang on said the wizard slowly 
 
 his eyes had darted from the silver badge on chest to his forehead 
 
 thank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates 
 
 jostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them nearby stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises 
 
 all right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasley 
 
 you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the box 
 
 not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it was a chicken until it started breathing fire looks like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to me 
 
 with a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and harry found himself jammed against the back wall several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching eye flattening his fringe as he did so the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again 
 
 level seven department of magical games and sports incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patents office 
 
 the lift doors opened harry glimpsed an corridor with various posters of quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls one of the wizards in the lift who was carrying an armful of broomsticks extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor the doors closed the lift juddered upwards again and the voice announced 
 
 level six department of magical transportation incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test centre 
 
 once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out at the same time several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet colour and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wings 
 
 just memos mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owls but the mess was unbelievable droppings all over the desks 
 
 as they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the ceiling 
 
 level five department of international magical cooperation incorporating the international magical trading standards body the international magical office of law and the international confederation of wizards british seats 
 
 when the doors opened two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards but several more memos zoomed in so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it 
 
 level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau 
 
 said the wizard carrying the chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos the doors clanged shut yet again 
 
 level three department of magical accidents and catastrophes including the accidental magic reversal squad obliviator headquarters and excuse committee 
 
 everybody left the lift on this floor except mr weasley harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor the remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services 
 
 this is us harry said mr weasley and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors my office is on the other side of the floor 
 
 mr weasley said harry as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming we still underground 
 
 yes we are said mr weasley those are enchanted windows magical maintenance decide what weather get every day we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise just round here harry 
 
 they turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles which was buzzing with talk and laughter memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters 
 
 harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families to posters of their favourite quidditch teams and articles from the daily prophet a man with a ponytail longer than was sitting with his boots up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little further along a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 morning weasley said kingsley carelessly as they drew nearer been wanting a word with you have you got a second 
 
 yes if it really is a second said mr weasley in rather a hurry 
 
 they were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr weasly stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle 
 
 harry received a slight shock blinking down at him from every direction was face newspaper cuttings and old photographseven the one of sirius being best man at the potters weddingpapered the walls the only space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels 
 
 here said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need as much information as possible on flying muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months received information that black might still be using his old motorcycle 
 
 kingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tones and take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month 
 
 if you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms said mr weasley coolly and afraid have to wait for information on motorcycles extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven making meatballs 
 
 he beckoned to harry and led him out of cubicle through a second set of oak doors into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artefacts 
 
 mr dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files the little wall space available bore witness to mr obsessions there were several posters of cars including one of a dismantled engine two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of muggle books and a diagram showing how to wire a plug 
 
 sitting on top of mr overflowing was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of it 
 
 we got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair asked but they seem to think we need one have a seat harry look as if perkins is in yet 
 
 harry squeezed himself into the chair behind desk while mr weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given him 
 
 ah he said grinning as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from its midst yes he flicked through it yes right sure sirius will find that very amusingoh dear this now 
 
 a memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read aloud third regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous 
 
 a regurgitating toilet 
 
 pranksters said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearingwell you can imagine the poor things keep calling in thosepumbles i think calledyou know the ones who mend pipes and things 
 
 plumbers 
 
 exactly yes but of course flummoxed i only hope we can catch doing it 
 
 will it be aurors who catch them 
 
 oh no this is too trivial for aurors be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrolah harry this is perkins 
 
 a stooped old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room panting 
 
 oh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not just sent an owl to your home but obviously missed itan urgent message came ten minutes ago 
 
 i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasley 
 
 no no not the toilet the potter changed the time and venueit starts at eight now and down in old courtroom ten 
 
 down in old but they told beard 
 
 mr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chair 
 
 quick harry we should have been there five minutes ago 
 
 perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as mr weasley left the office at a run harry close on his heels 
 
 why have they changed the time harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the auror cubicles people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at desk 
 
 no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if missed it it would have been catastrophic 
 
 mr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button 
 
 come on 
 
 the lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button 
 
 those courtrooms been used in years said mr weasley angrily i think why doing it down thereunlessbut no 
 
 a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaborate 
 
 the atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain the plump witch got out and a wizard with a very mournful face got in 
 
 morning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend often see you down here 
 
 urgent business bode said mr weasley who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at harry 
 
 ah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of course 
 
 harry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable 
 
 department of mysteries said the cool female voice and left it at that 
 
 quick harry said mr weasley as the lift doors rattled open and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above the walls were bare there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps 
 
 down here down here panted mr weasley taking two steps at a time the lift even come down this far why doing it down there 
 
 they reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone walls and torches in brackets the doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes 
 
 courtroom ten i think nearly yes 
 
 mr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest 
 
 go on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in there 
 
 you coming with 
 
 no no not allowed good luck 
 
 heart was beating a violent tattoo against his apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix

 harry awoke at five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses mrs weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggered 
 
 ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir as harry crossed the room stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying not to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow students at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stairs past the heads of ancestors and down into the kitchen

 i keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harry 
 
 thank you 
 
 hang on said the wizard slowly 
 
 his eyes had darted from the silver badge on chest to his forehead 
 
 thank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates 
 
 jostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them nearby stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises 
 
 all right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasley 
 
 you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the box 
 
 not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it was a chicken until it started breathing fire looks like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to me 
 
 with a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and harry found himself jammed against the back wall several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching eye flattening his fringe as he did so the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again 
 
 level seven department of magical games and sports incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patents office 
 
 the lift doors opened harry glimpsed an corridor with various posters of quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls one of the wizards in the lift who was carrying an armful of broomsticks extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor the doors closed the lift juddered upwards again and the voice announced 
 
 level six department of magical transportation incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test centre 
 
 once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out at the same time several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet colour and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wings 
 
 just memos mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owls but the mess was unbelievable droppings all over the desks 
 
 as they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the ceiling 
 
 level five department of international magical cooperation incorporating the international magical trading standards body the international magical office of law and the international confederation of wizards british seats 
 
 when the doors opened two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards but several more memos zoomed in so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it 
 
 level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau 
 
 said the wizard carrying the chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos the doors clanged shut yet again 
 
 level three department of magical accidents and catastrophes including the accidental magic reversal squad obliviator headquarters and excuse committee 
 
 everybody left the lift on this floor except mr weasley harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor the remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services 
 
 this is us harry said mr weasley and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors my office is on the other side of the floor 
 
 mr weasley said harry as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming we still underground 
 
 yes we are said mr weasley those are enchanted windows magical maintenance decide what weather get every day we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise just round here harry 
 
 they turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles which was buzzing with talk and laughter memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters 
 
 harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families to posters of their favourite quidditch teams and articles from the daily prophet a man with a ponytail longer than was sitting with his boots up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little further along a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 morning weasley said kingsley carelessly as they drew nearer been wanting a word with you have you got a second 
 
 yes if it really is a second said mr weasley in rather a hurry 
 
 they were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr weasly stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle 
 
 harry received a slight shock blinking down at him from every direction was face newspaper cuttings and old photographseven the one of sirius being best man at the potters weddingpapered the walls the only space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels 
 
 here said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need as much information as possible on flying muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months received information that black might still be using his old motorcycle 
 
 kingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tones and take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month 
 
 if you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms said mr weasley coolly and afraid have to wait for information on motorcycles extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven making meatballs 
 
 he beckoned to harry and led him out of cubicle through a second set of oak doors into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artefacts 
 
 mr dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files the little wall space available bore witness to mr obsessions there were several posters of cars including one of a dismantled engine two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of muggle books and a diagram showing how to wire a plug 
 
 sitting on top of mr overflowing was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of it 
 
 we got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair asked but they seem to think we need one have a seat harry look as if perkins is in yet 
 
 harry squeezed himself into the chair behind desk while mr weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given him 
 
 ah he said grinning as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from its midst yes he flicked through it yes right sure sirius will find that very amusingoh dear this now 
 
 a memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read aloud third regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous 
 
 a regurgitating toilet 
 
 pranksters said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearingwell you can imagine the poor things keep calling in thosepumbles i think calledyou know the ones who mend pipes and things 
 
 plumbers 
 
 exactly yes but of course flummoxed i only hope we can catch doing it 
 
 will it be aurors who catch them 
 
 oh no this is too trivial for aurors be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrolah harry this is perkins 
 
 a stooped old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room panting 
 
 oh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not just sent an owl to your home but obviously missed itan urgent message came ten minutes ago 
 
 i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasley 
 
 no no not the toilet the potter changed the time and venueit starts at eight now and down in old courtroom ten 
 
 down in old but they told beard 
 
 mr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chair 
 
 quick harry we should have been there five minutes ago 
 
 perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as mr weasley left the office at a run harry close on his heels 
 
 why have they changed the time harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the auror cubicles people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at desk 
 
 no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if missed it it would have been catastrophic 
 
 mr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button 
 
 come on 
 
 the lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button 
 
 those courtrooms been used in years said mr weasley angrily i think why doing it down thereunlessbut no 
 
 a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaborate 
 
 the atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain the plump witch got out and a wizard with a very mournful face got in 
 
 morning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend often see you down here 
 
 urgent business bode said mr weasley who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at harry 
 
 ah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of course 
 
 harry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable 
 
 department of mysteries said the cool female voice and left it at that 
 
 quick harry said mr weasley as the lift doors rattled open and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above the walls were bare there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps 
 
 down here down here panted mr weasley taking two steps at a time the lift even come down this far why doing it down there 
 
 they reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone walls and torches in brackets the doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes 
 
 courtroom ten i think nearly yes 
 
 mr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest 
 
 go on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in there 
 
 you coming with 
 
 no no not allowed good luck 
 
 heart was beating a violent tattoo against his apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter seven the slug clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on face as he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days 
 
 yes already agreed it was fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but we agreed there could be a lot of explanations 
 
 maybe broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his bent tail twigs remember that arm malfoy had 
 
 but what about when he said forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both 
 
 you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle 
 
 yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said in azkaban you think like revenge 
 
 ron looked up blinking 
 
 malfoy revenge what can he do about it 
 
 my point i know said harry frustrated but up to something and i think we should take it seriously his a death eater and 
 
 harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him 
 
 harry said hermione in an anxious voice wrong 
 
 your not hurting again is it asked ron nervously 
 
 a death eater said harry slowly replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy sixteen harry you think would let malfoy join 
 
 it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what makes you think 
 
 in madam she touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it was his left arm been branded with the dark mark 
 
 ron and hermione looked at each other 
 
 well said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced 
 
 i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione 
 
 he showed borgin something we see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it was the mark i know ithe was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged another look 
 
 not sure harry 
 
 yeah i still reckon would let malfoy join 
 
 annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes 
 
 i go in the kitchen just now she warned him a lot of phlegm around 
 
 be careful not to slip in it harry smiled 
 
 sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs weasley kept watch over a pile of sprouts looking 
 
 bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale goldpink would of course be orrible with air 
 
 ah harry said mrs weasley loudly cutting across monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station 
 
 is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch things 
 
 no i think so been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said 
 
 she has let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you ask 
 
 yes thank you said mrs weasley tartly cutting across fleur again better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we have the usual scramble 
 
 and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig owl pigwidgeon and new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages 
 
 au revoir arry said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at feet furious and he hurried into the car without saying goodbye 
 
 there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at cross station instead two bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking 
 
 quick quick through the barrier said mrs weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with 
 
 she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten 
 
 i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd 
 
 hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds without waiting to consult his auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment 
 
 we harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit 
 
 oh yeah i forgot said harry 
 
 better get straight on the train all of you only got a few minutes to go said mrs weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron 
 
 mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment 
 
 of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless 
 
 harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger 
 
 he could see mrs weasley and the auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away 
 
 when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace 
 
 am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and shop 
 
 how did you 
 
 harry please talking to the man who raised fred and george 
 
 er yeah all right we in the back room 
 
 very well then hear the worst 
 
 well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak 
 
 did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim 
 
 because i thought malfoy was up to something said harry disregarding mr look of mingled exasperation and amusement given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why 
 
 of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why 
 
 he went into borgin and burkes said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and 
 
 harry took a deep breath 
 
 something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i think been branded with the dark mark i think replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether would allow a 
 
 does anyone really know what would or do asked harry angrily mr weasley sorry but it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done probably something dark or dangerous it 
 
 i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous 
 
 i think you missed something said harry stubbornly 
 
 well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley was humoring him 
 
 there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing 
 
 better hurry said mr weasley as mrs weasley cried harry quickly 
 
 he hurried forward and mr and mrs weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train 
 
 now dear coming to us for christmas all fixed with dumbledore so see you quite soon said mrs weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move you make sure you look after yourself and 
 
 the train was gathering speed 
 
 be good and she was jogging to keep up now 
 
 stay safe 
 
 harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mrs weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends he made his way toward her dragging his trunk 
 
 people stared shamelessly as he approached they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder 
 
 fancy trying to find a compartment 
 
 i harry i said meet dean said ginny brightly see you later 
 
 right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls 
 
 hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him 
 
 neville said harry in relief turning to see a boy struggling toward him 
 
 hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville 
 
 luna hi how are you 
 
 very well thank you said luna she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside 
 
 the quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year 
 
 oh yes well up said luna happily 
 
 find seats said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully 
 
 even staring at us said neville indicating himself and luna because with you 
 
 staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you seen it 
 
 yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she was really pleased says starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look 
 
 he pulled it out and showed it to harry 
 
 cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next dayoi come back here trevor 
 
 and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom 
 
 are we still doing meetings this year harry asked luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler 
 
 no point now got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed 
 
 i liked the i learned loads with you 
 
 i enjoyed the meetings too said luna serenely it was like having friends 
 
 this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass 
 
 you ask him 
 
 no you 
 
 do it 
 
 and one of them a girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door 
 
 hi harry romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why you join us in our compartment you have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl 
 
 friends of mine said harry coldly 
 
 oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay 
 
 and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her 
 
 people expect you to have cooler friends than us said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty 
 
 you are cool said harry shortly none of them was at the ministry they fight with me 
 
 a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler 
 
 we face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together give anything to have you as a grandson 
 
 harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to results as soon as he could while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening 
 
 childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant 
 
 had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the scar and the weight of the prophecy or would it would mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not 
 
 you all right harry you look funny said neville 
 
 harry started 
 
 sorryi 
 
 wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles 
 
 iwhat 
 
 a wrackspurt invisible they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here 
 
 she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths harry and neville caught each eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch 
 
 the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last 
 
 wish the lunch trolley would hurry up starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry not doing prefect duty just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed 
 
 harry sat up straight interested it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year 
 
 what did he do when he saw you 
 
 the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture not like him though is it well that did the hand gesture why he out there bullying first years 
 
 dunno said harry but his mind was racing this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students 
 
 maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that 
 
 i think so said harry i think 
 
 but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless girl stepped inside 
 
 supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry she faltered as her eyes met and she turned scarlet she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment 
 
 what is it ron demanded as harry unrolled his 
 
 an invitation said harry 
 
 harry 
 i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c 
 sincerely professor slughorn 
 professor slughorn asked neville looked perplexedly at his own invitation 
 
 new teacher said harry well i suppose have to go we 
 
 but what does he want me for asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention 
 
 no idea said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what up to 
 
 this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on 
 
 when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated 
 
 harry said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom 
 
 neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guests he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny 
 
 now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course 
 
 zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle 
 
 this is cormac mclaggen perhaps come across each other no 
 
 mclaggen a large youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him 
 
 and this is marcus belby i know whether 
 
 belby who was thin and gave a strained smile 
 
 and this charming young lady tells me she knows you slughorn finished 
 
 ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind back 
 
 well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better here take a napkin packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old digestive system quite up to such things pheasant belby 
 
 belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant 
 
 i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most do you see much of your uncle marcus 
 
 unfortunately beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke 
 
 anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once 
 
 not not much of him no gasped belby his eyes streaming 
 
 well of course i daresay busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work 
 
 i suppose said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him er he and my dad get on very well you see so i really know much about 
 
 his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead 
 
 now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk 
 
 oh yeah that was fun that was said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeourthis was before he became minister obviously 
 
 ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out now tell me 
 
 it was as harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody or influential everyone except ginny zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold it was turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for parents aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies at the end of interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair 
 
 and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer 
 
 he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one calling you now 
 
 harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him 
 
 of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumors for years i remember whenwellafter that terrible nightlilyjamesand you survivedand the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary 
 
 zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn 
 
 yeah zabini because so talented at posing 
 
 oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous hex as i was passing her carriage i cross her 
 
 zabini merely looked contemptuous 
 
 anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumors this summer of course one know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all 
 
 harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him 
 
 so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fondyou were there then but the rest of the storiesso sensational of course one know quite what to believethis fabled prophecy for instance 
 
 we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink as he said it 
 
 right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual 
 
 you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat before his encouraging smile yes well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 he meandered off into a reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny 
 
 the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight 
 
 good gracious getting dark already i notice that lit the lamps better go and change into your robes all of you mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time passing same goes for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go 
 
 as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train 
 
 glad over muttered neville strange man he 
 
 yeah he is a bit said harry his eyes on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny 
 
 he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed himwhen slughorn came in i thought i was going to got detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh 
 
 better reason for inviting someone than because their famous said harry scowling at the back of head or because their uncle 
 
 but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea in a time zabini was going to the slytherin compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey lefthogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windowsbut nobody else seemed prepared to take suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them 
 
 see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself 
 
 but you asked neville 
 
 later whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless 
 
 the corridors were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing 
 
 wrong with this thing said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into foot 
 
 harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of comic directly below him 
 
 so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want 
 
 just trying to make up to people said zabini who was still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find many 
 
 this information did not seem to please malfoy 
 
 who else had he invited he demanded 
 
 mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini 
 
 oh yeah his big in the ministry said malfoy 
 
 someone else called belby from ravenclaw 
 
 not him a prat said pansy 
 
 and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini 
 
 malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking hand aside 
 
 he invited longbottom 
 
 well i assume so as longbottom was there said zabini indifferently 
 
 longbottom got to interest slughorn 
 
 zabini shrugged 
 
 potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl so special about her 
 
 a lot of boys like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction even you think you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please 
 
 i touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair 
 
 well i pity taste maybe going a bit senile shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably heard on the train or 
 
 i bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about father when i first arrived they used to be old friends apparently but when he heard been caught at the ministry he look happy and nott get an invitation did he i think interested in death eaters 
 
 malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh 
 
 well who cares what interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year it matter to me if some fat old likes me or not 
 
 what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once 
 
 well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might haveermoved on to bigger and better things 
 
 crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy s hair looking dumbfounded 
 
 do you meanhim 
 
 malfoy shrugged 
 
 mother wants me to complete my education but personally i see it as that important these days i mean think about it when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many or got of course he be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown 
 
 and you think be able to do something for him asked zabini scathingly sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet 
 
 just said i maybe he care if qualified maybe the job he wants me to do something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly 
 
 crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so 
 
 i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window better get our robes on 
 
 harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning 
 
 harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck 
 
 harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed 
 
 you go on malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something 
 
 pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again 
 
 harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing crash at feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly 
 
 i thought so he said jubilantly i heard trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back his eyes lingered for a moment upon trainers that was you blocking the door when zabini came back in i suppose 
 
 he considered harry a moment 
 
 you hear anything i care about potter but while got you here 
 
 and he stamped hard on face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere 
 
 from my father now see 
 
 malfoy dragged the cloak out from under immobilized body and threw it over him 
 
 i reckon find you till the back in london he said quietly see you around potter or not 
 
 and taking care to tread on fingers malfoy left the compartment 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the slug clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on face as he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days 
 
 yes already agreed it was fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but we agreed there could be a lot of explanations 
 
 maybe broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his bent tail twigs remember that arm malfoy had 
 
 but what about when he said forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both 
 
 you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle 
 
 yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said in azkaban you think like revenge 
 
 ron looked up blinking 
 
 malfoy revenge what can he do about it 
 
 my point i know said harry frustrated but up to something and i think we should take it seriously his a death eater and 
 
 harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him 
 
 harry said hermione in an anxious voice wrong 
 
 your not hurting again is it asked ron nervously 
 
 a death eater said harry slowly replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy sixteen harry you think would let malfoy join 
 
 it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what makes you think 
 
 in madam she touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it was his left arm been branded with the dark mark 
 
 ron and hermione looked at each other 
 
 well said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced 
 
 i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione 
 
 he showed borgin something we see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it was the mark i know ithe was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged another look 
 
 not sure harry 
 
 yeah i still reckon would let malfoy join 
 
 annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes 
 
 i go in the kitchen just now she warned him a lot of phlegm around 
 
 be careful not to slip in it harry smiled 
 
 sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs weasley kept watch over a pile of sprouts looking 
 
 bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale goldpink would of course be orrible with air 
 
 ah harry said mrs weasley loudly cutting across monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station 
 
 is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch things 
 
 no i think so been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said 
 
 she has let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you ask 
 
 yes thank you said mrs weasley tartly cutting across fleur again better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we have the usual scramble 
 
 and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig owl pigwidgeon and new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages 
 
 au revoir arry said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at feet furious and he hurried into the car without saying goodbye 
 
 there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at cross station instead two bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking 
 
 quick quick through the barrier said mrs weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with 
 
 she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten 
 
 i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd 
 
 hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds without waiting to consult his auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment 
 
 we harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit 
 
 oh yeah i forgot said harry 
 
 better get straight on the train all of you only got a few minutes to go said mrs weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron 
 
 mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment 
 
 of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless 
 
 harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger 
 
 he could see mrs weasley and the auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away 
 
 when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace 
 
 am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and shop 
 
 how did you 
 
 harry please talking to the man who raised fred and george 
 
 er yeah all right we in the back room 
 
 very well then hear the worst 
 
 well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak 
 
 did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim 
 
 because i thought malfoy was up to something said harry disregarding mr look of mingled exasperation and amusement given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why 
 
 of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why 
 
 he went into borgin and burkes said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and 
 
 harry took a deep breath 
 
 something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i think been branded with the dark mark i think replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether would allow a 
 
 does anyone really know what would or do asked harry angrily mr weasley sorry but it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done probably something dark or dangerous it 
 
 i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous 
 
 i think you missed something said harry stubbornly 
 
 well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley was humoring him 
 
 there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing 
 
 better hurry said mr weasley as mrs weasley cried harry quickly 
 
 he hurried forward and mr and mrs weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train 
 
 now dear coming to us for christmas all fixed with dumbledore so see you quite soon said mrs weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move you make sure you look after yourself and 
 
 the train was gathering speed 
 
 be good and she was jogging to keep up now 
 
 stay safe 
 
 harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mrs weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends he made his way toward her dragging his trunk 
 
 people stared shamelessly as he approached they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder 
 
 fancy trying to find a compartment 
 
 i harry i said meet dean said ginny brightly see you later 
 
 right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls 
 
 hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him 
 
 neville said harry in relief turning to see a boy struggling toward him 
 
 hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville 
 
 luna hi how are you 
 
 very well thank you said luna she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside 
 
 the quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year 
 
 oh yes well up said luna happily 
 
 find seats said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully 
 
 even staring at us said neville indicating himself and luna because with you 
 
 staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you seen it 
 
 yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she was really pleased says starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look 
 
 he pulled it out and showed it to harry 
 
 cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next dayoi come back here trevor 
 
 and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom 
 
 are we still doing meetings this year harry asked luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler 
 
 no point now got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed 
 
 i liked the i learned loads with you 
 
 i enjoyed the meetings too said luna serenely it was like having friends 
 
 this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass 
 
 you ask him 
 
 no you 
 
 do it 
 
 and one of them a girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door 
 
 hi harry romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why you join us in our compartment you have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl 
 
 friends of mine said harry coldly 
 
 oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay 
 
 and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her 
 
 people expect you to have cooler friends than us said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty 
 
 you are cool said harry shortly none of them was at the ministry they fight with me 
 
 a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler 
 
 we face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together give anything to have you as a grandson 
 
 harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to results as soon as he could while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening 
 
 childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant 
 
 had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the scar and the weight of the prophecy or would it would mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not 
 
 you all right harry you look funny said neville 
 
 harry started 
 
 sorryi 
 
 wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles 
 
 iwhat 
 
 a wrackspurt invisible they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here 
 
 she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths harry and neville caught each eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch 
 
 the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last 
 
 wish the lunch trolley would hurry up starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry not doing prefect duty just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed 
 
 harry sat up straight interested it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year 
 
 what did he do when he saw you 
 
 the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture not like him though is it well that did the hand gesture why he out there bullying first years 
 
 dunno said harry but his mind was racing this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students 
 
 maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that 
 
 i think so said harry i think 
 
 but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless girl stepped inside 
 
 supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry she faltered as her eyes met and she turned scarlet she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment 
 
 what is it ron demanded as harry unrolled his 
 
 an invitation said harry 
 
 harry 
 i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c 
 sincerely professor slughorn 
 professor slughorn asked neville looked perplexedly at his own invitation 
 
 new teacher said harry well i suppose have to go we 
 
 but what does he want me for asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention 
 
 no idea said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what up to 
 
 this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on 
 
 when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated 
 
 harry said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom 
 
 neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guests he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny 
 
 now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course 
 
 zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle 
 
 this is cormac mclaggen perhaps come across each other no 
 
 mclaggen a large youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him 
 
 and this is marcus belby i know whether 
 
 belby who was thin and gave a strained smile 
 
 and this charming young lady tells me she knows you slughorn finished 
 
 ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind back 
 
 well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better here take a napkin packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old digestive system quite up to such things pheasant belby 
 
 belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant 
 
 i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most do you see much of your uncle marcus 
 
 unfortunately beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke 
 
 anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once 
 
 not not much of him no gasped belby his eyes streaming 
 
 well of course i daresay busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work 
 
 i suppose said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him er he and my dad get on very well you see so i really know much about 
 
 his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead 
 
 now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk 
 
 oh yeah that was fun that was said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeourthis was before he became minister obviously 
 
 ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out now tell me 
 
 it was as harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody or influential everyone except ginny zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold it was turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for parents aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies at the end of interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair 
 
 and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer 
 
 he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one calling you now 
 
 harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him 
 
 of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumors for years i remember whenwellafter that terrible nightlilyjamesand you survivedand the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary 
 
 zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn 
 
 yeah zabini because so talented at posing 
 
 oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous hex as i was passing her carriage i cross her 
 
 zabini merely looked contemptuous 
 
 anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumors this summer of course one know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all 
 
 harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him 
 
 so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fondyou were there then but the rest of the storiesso sensational of course one know quite what to believethis fabled prophecy for instance 
 
 we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink as he said it 
 
 right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual 
 
 you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat before his encouraging smile yes well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 he meandered off into a reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny 
 
 the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight 
 
 good gracious getting dark already i notice that lit the lamps better go and change into your robes all of you mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time passing same goes for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go 
 
 as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train 
 
 glad over muttered neville strange man he 
 
 yeah he is a bit said harry his eyes on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny 
 
 he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed himwhen slughorn came in i thought i was going to got detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh 
 
 better reason for inviting someone than because their famous said harry scowling at the back of head or because their uncle 
 
 but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea in a time zabini was going to the slytherin compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey lefthogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windowsbut nobody else seemed prepared to take suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them 
 
 see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself 
 
 but you asked neville 
 
 later whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless 
 
 the corridors were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing 
 
 wrong with this thing said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into foot 
 
 harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of comic directly below him 
 
 so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want 
 
 just trying to make up to people said zabini who was still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find many 
 
 this information did not seem to please malfoy 
 
 who else had he invited he demanded 
 
 mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini 
 
 oh yeah his big in the ministry said malfoy 
 
 someone else called belby from ravenclaw 
 
 not him a prat said pansy 
 
 and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini 
 
 malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking hand aside 
 
 he invited longbottom 
 
 well i assume so as longbottom was there said zabini indifferently 
 
 longbottom got to interest slughorn 
 
 zabini shrugged 
 
 potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl so special about her 
 
 a lot of boys like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction even you think you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please 
 
 i touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair 
 
 well i pity taste maybe going a bit senile shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably heard on the train or 
 
 i bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about father when i first arrived they used to be old friends apparently but when he heard been caught at the ministry he look happy and nott get an invitation did he i think interested in death eaters 
 
 malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh 
 
 well who cares what interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year it matter to me if some fat old likes me or not 
 
 what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once 
 
 well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might haveermoved on to bigger and better things 
 
 crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy s hair looking dumbfounded 
 
 do you meanhim 
 
 malfoy shrugged 
 
 mother wants me to complete my education but personally i see it as that important these days i mean think about it when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many or got of course he be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown 
 
 and you think be able to do something for him asked zabini scathingly sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet 
 
 just said i maybe he care if qualified maybe the job he wants me to do something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly 
 
 crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so 
 
 i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window better get our robes on 
 
 harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning 
 
 harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck 
 
 harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed 
 
 you go on malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something 
 
 pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again 
 
 harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing crash at feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly 
 
 i thought so he said jubilantly i heard trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back his eyes lingered for a moment upon trainers that was you blocking the door when zabini came back in i suppose 
 
 he considered harry a moment 
 
 you hear anything i care about potter but while got you here 
 
 and he stamped hard on face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere 
 
 from my father now see 
 
 malfoy dragged the cloak out from under immobilized body and threw it over him 
 
 i reckon find you till the back in london he said quietly see you around potter or not 
 
 and taking care to tread on fingers malfoy left the compartment 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the will of albus dumbledorecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem 
 
 oi wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying again on the camp bed in rons dingy attic room the sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing the scar on harrys forehead was prickling 
 
 you were muttering in your sleep 
 
 was i 
 
 yeah gregorovitch you kept saying gregorovitch 
 
 harry was not wearing his glasses rons face appeared slightly blurred 
 
 whos gregorovitch 
 
 i dunno do i you were the one saying it 
 
 harry rubbed his forehead thinking he had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where 
 
 i think voldemorts looking for him 
 
 poor bloke said ron fervently 
 
 harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake he tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley 
 
 i think hes abroad 
 
 who gregorovitch 
 
 voldemort i think hes somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch it didnt look like anywhere in britain 
 
 you reckon you were seeing into his mind again 
 
 ron sounded worried 
 
 do me a favor and dont tell hermione said harry although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep 
 
 he gazed up at little pigwidgeons cage thinkingwhy was the name gregorovitch familiar 
 
 i think he said slowly hes got something to do with quidditch theres some connection but i cantci cant think what it is 
 
 quidditch said ron sure youre not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 who 
 
 dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago record holder for most quaffle drops in a season 
 
 no said harry im definitely not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 i try not to either said ron well happy birthday anyway 
 
 wow c thats right i forgot im seventeen 
 
 harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said accio glasses although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye 
 
 slick snorted ron 
 
 reveling in the removal of his trace harry sent rons possessions flying around the room causing pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on rons chudley cannons posters bright blue 
 
 id do your fly by hand though ron advised harry sniggering when harry immediately checked it heres your present unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes 
 
 a book said harry as he took the rectangular parcel bit of a departure from tradition isnt it 
 
 this isnt your average book said ron itd pure gold twelve ways to charm witches explains everything you need to know about girls if only id had this last year id have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i wouldve known how to get going with well fred and george gave me a copy and ive learned a lot youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either 
 
 when they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table bill and monsieur delacour were finishing their breakfasts while mrs weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan 
 
 arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry said mrs weasley beaming at him he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner thats our present on top 
 
 harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it inside was a watch very like the one mr and mrs weasley had given ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the race instead of hands 
 
 its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age said mrs weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker im afraid that one isnt new like rons it was actually my brother fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back butc 
 
 the rest of her speech was lost harry had got up and hugged her he tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor 
 
 happy birthday harry said hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile its not much but i hope you like it what did you get him she added to ron who seemed not to hear her 
 
 come on then open hermiones said ron 
 
 she had bought him a new sneakoscope the other packages contained an enchanted razor from bill and fleur ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave monsieur delacour assured him but you must tell it clearly what you wantozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like chocolates from the delacours and an enormous box of the latest weasleys wizard wheezes merchandise from fred and george 
 
 harry ron and hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of madame delacour fleur and gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded 
 
 ill pack these for you hermione said brightly taking harrys presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs im nearly done im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ronc 
 
 rons splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the landing 
 
 harry will you come in here a moment 
 
 it was ginny ron came to an abrupt halt but hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs feeling nervous harry followed ginny into her room 
 
 he had never been inside it before it was small but bright there was a large poster of the wizarding band the weird sisters on one wall and a picture of gwenog jones captain of the quidditch team the holyhead harpies on the other a desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and ginny had once played a quidditch with ron and hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee the golden flag on top was level with ginnys window 
 
 ginny looked up into harrys face took a deep breath and said happy seventeenth 
 
 yeahthanks 
 
 she was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light 
 
 nice view he said feebly pointing toward with window 
 
 she ignored this he could not blame her 
 
 i couldnt think what to get you she said 
 
 you didnt have to get me anything 
 
 she disregarded this too 
 
 i didnt know what would be useful nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you 
 
 he chanced a glance at her she was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about ginny she was rarely weepy he had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up 
 
 she took a step closer to him 
 
 so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing 
 
 i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest 
 
 theres the silver lining ive been looking for she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long hairc the door banged open behind them and they jumped apart 
 
 oh said ron pointedly sorry 
 
 ron hermione was just behind him slight out of breath there was a strained silence then ginny had said in a flat little voice well happy birthday anyway harry 
 
 rons ears were scarlet hermione looked nervous harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble all the reasons for ending his relationship with ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone 
 
 he looked at ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him he thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears he could not do anything to comfort her in front of ron 
 
 ill see you later he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom 
 
 ron marched downstairs though the kitchen and into the yard and harry kept pace with him all the way hermione trotting along behind them looking scared 
 
 once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn ron rounded on harry 
 
 you ditched her what are you doing now messing her around 
 
 im not messing her around said harry as hermione caught up with them 
 
 ronc 
 
 but ron held up a hand to silence her 
 
 she was really cut up when you ended itc 
 
 so was i you know why i stopped it and it wasnt because i wanted to 
 
 yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up againc 
 
 shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us tocto end up married orc 
 
 as he said it a vivid picture formed in harrys mind of ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger 
 
 in one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him her future was free and unencumbered whereas hishe could see nothing but voldemort ahead 
 
 if you keep groping her every chance you getc 
 
 it wont happen again said harry harshly the day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in okay 
 
 ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said right then well thatsyeah 
 
 
 
 
 ginny did not seek another meeting with harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room nevertheless charlies arrival came as a relief to harry it provided a distraction watching mrs weasley force charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut 
 
 as harrys birthday dinner would have stretched the burrows kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of charlie lupin tonks and hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden fred and george bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number to hang in midair over the guests thanks to mrs weasleys ministrations georges wound was neat and clean but harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins many jokes about it 
 
 hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes 
 
 nice said ron as with one final flourish of her wand hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold youve really got an eye for that sort of thing 
 
 thank you ron said hermione looking both pleased and a little confused harry turned away smiling to himself he had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of twelve ways to charm witches he caught ginnys eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with monsieur delacour 
 
 out of the way out of the way sang mrs weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant snitch floating in front of her seconds later harry realized that it was his birthday cake which mrs weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground when the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table harry said that looks amazing mrs weasley 
 
 oh its nothing dear she said fondly over her shoulder ron gave harry the and mouthed good one 
 
 by seven oclock all the guests had arrived led into the house by fred and george who had waited for them at the end of the lane hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit although lupin smiled as he shook harrys hand harry thought he looked rather unhappy it was all very odd tonks beside him looked simply radiant 
 
 happy birthday harry she said hugging him tightly 
 
 seventeen eh said hagrid as he accepted a glass of wine from fred six years ter the day since we met harry dyeh remember it 
 
 vaguely said harry grinning up at him didnt you smash down the front door give dudley a pigs tail and tell me i was a wizard 
 
 i forge the details hagrid chortled all righ ron hermione 
 
 were fine said hermione how are you 
 
 ar not bad bin busy we got some newborn unicorns ill show yeh when yeh get backc harry avoided rons and hermiones gazes as hagrid rummaged in his pocket here harry c couldnt think what ter get teh but then i remembered this he pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck mokeskin hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out theyre rare them 
 
 hagrid thanks 
 
 snothin said hagrid with a wave of a hand an theres charlie always liked him c hey charlie 
 
 charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut he was shorter than ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms 
 
 hi hagrid hows it going 
 
 bin meanin ter write fer ages hows norbert doin 
 
 norbert charlie laughed the norwegian ridgeback we call her norberta now 
 
 wha c norberts a girl 
 
 oh yeah said charlie 
 
 how can you tell asked hermione 
 
 theyre a lot more vicious said charlie he looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice wish dad would hurry up and get here mums getting edgy 
 
 they all looked over at mrs weasley she was trying to talk to madame delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate 
 
 i think wed better start without arthur she called to the garden at large after a moment or two he must have been held up at c oh 
 
 they all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with mr weasleys voice 
 
 minister of magic coming with me 
 
 the patronus dissolved into thin air leaving fleurs family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished 
 
 we shouldnt be here said lupin at once harry c im sorry c ill explain some other timec 
 
 he seized tonkss wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight mrs weasley looked bewildered 
 
 the minister c but whyc i dont understandc 
 
 but there was no time to discuss the matter a second later mr weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by rufus scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair 
 
 the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer as scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light harry saw that he looked much older than the last time that had met scraggy and grim 
 
 sorry to intrude said scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table especially as i can see that i am a party 
 
 his eyes lingered for a moment on the giant snitch cake 
 
 many happy returns 
 
 thanks said harry 
 
 i require a private word with you scrimgeour went on also with mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger 
 
 us said ron sounding surprised why us 
 
 i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private said scrimgeour is there such a place he demanded of mr weasley 
 
 yes of course said mr weasley who looked nervous the er sitting room why dont you use that 
 
 you can lead the way scrimgeour said to ron there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur 
 
 harry saw mr weasley exchange a worried look with mrs weasley as he ron and hermione stood up as they led the way back to the house in silence harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was scrimgeour must somehow had learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of hogwarts 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the burrows sitting room although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that mr weasley normally occupied leaving harry ron and hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa once they had done so scrimgeour spoke 
 
 i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually if you two c he pointed at harry and hermione c can wait upstairs i will start with ronald 
 
 were not going anywhere said harry while hermione nodded vigorously you can speak to us together or not at all 
 
 scrimgeour gave harry a cold appraising look harry had the impression that the minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early 
 
 very well then together he said shrugging he cleared his throat i am here as im sure you know because of albus dumbledores will 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another 
 
 a surprise apparently you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything 
 
 of us said ron me and hermione too 
 
 yes all of c 
 
 but harry interrupted 
 
 dumbledore died over a month ago why has it taken this long to give us what he left us 
 
 isnt it obvious said hermione before scrimgeour could answer they wanted to examine whatever hes left us you had no right to do that she said and her voice trembled slightly 
 
 i had every right said scrimgeour dismissively the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a willc 
 
 that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts said hermione and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed 
 
 are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 no im not retorted hermione im hoping to do some good in the world 
 
 ron laughed scrimgeours eyes flickered toward him and away again as harry spoke 
 
 so why have you decided to let us have our things now cant think of a pretext to keep them 
 
 no itll be because days are up said hermione at once they cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous right 
 
 would you say you were close to dumbledore ronald asked scrimgeour ignoring hermione ron looked startled 
 
 me not c not really it was always harry who 
 
 ron looked around at harry and hermione to see hermione giving him a sort of look but the damage was done scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear he swooped like a bird of prey upon rons answer 
 
 if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests the vast majority of his possessions c his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects c were left to hogwarts why do you think you were singled out 
 
 idunno said ron iwhen i say we werent closei mean i think he liked me 
 
 youre being modest ron said hermione dumbledore was very fond of you 
 
 this was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as harry knew ron and dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible however scrimgeour did not seem to be listening he put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one hagrid had given harry from it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud 
 
 the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore yes here we are to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it 
 
 scrimgeour took from the bag an object that harry had seen before it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the deluminator to ron who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned 
 
 that is a valuable object said scrimgeour watching ron it may even be unique certainly it is of dumbledores own design why would he have left you and item so rare 
 
 ron shook his head looking bewildered 
 
 dumbledore must have taught thousands of students scrimgeour persevered yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three why is that to what use did he think you would put to the deluminator mr weasley 
 
 put out lights i spose mumbled ron what else could i do with it 
 
 evidently scrimgeour had no suggestions after squinting at ron for a moment or tow he turned back to dumbledores will 
 
 to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive 
 
 scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of secrets of the darkest art upstairs its binding was stained and peeling in places hermione took it from scrimgeour without a word she held the book in her lap and gazed at it harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them as he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols 
 
 why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 he he knew i liked books said hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve 
 
 but why that particular book 
 
 i dont know he must have thought id enjoy it 
 
 did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore 
 
 no i didnt said hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve and if the ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in days i doubt that i will 
 
 she suppressed a sob they were wedged together so tightly that ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around hermiones shoulders scrimgeour turned back to the will 
 
 to harry james potter he read and harrys insides contracted with a sudden excitement i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill 
 
 as scrimgeour pulled out the tiny golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax 
 
 why did dumbledore leave you this snitch asked scrimgeour 
 
 no idea said harry for the reasons you just read out i suppose to remind me what you can get if you persevere and whatever it was 
 
 you think this a mere symbolic keepsake then 
 
 i suppose so said harry what else could it be 
 
 im asking the questions said scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge 
 
 i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch scrimgeour said to harry why is that 
 
 hermione laughed derisively 
 
 oh it cant be a reference to the fact harrys a great seeker thats way too obvious she said there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing 
 
 i dont think theres anything hidden in the icing said scrimgeour but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object you know why im sure 
 
 harry shrugged hermione however answered harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge 
 
 because snitches have flesh memories she said 
 
 what said harry and ron together both considered hermiones quidditch knowledge negligible 
 
 correct said scrimgeour a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture this snitch c he held up the tiny golden ball c will remember your touch potter 
 
 it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you 
 
 harrys heart was beating rather fast he was sure that scrimgeour was right how could he avoid taking the snitch with his bare hand in front of the minister 
 
 you dont say anything said scrimgeour perhaps you already know what the snitch contains 
 
 no said harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the snitch without really doing so if only he knew legilimency really knew it and could read hermiones mind he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him 
 
 take it said scrimgeour quietly 
 
 harry met the ministers yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey he held out his hand and scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the snitch slowly and deliberately into harrys palm 
 
 nothing happened as harrys fingers closed around the snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still scrimgeour ron and hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way 
 
 that was dramatic said harry coolly both ron and hermione laughed 
 
 thats all then is it asked hermione making to raise herself off the sofa 
 
 not quite said scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now dumbledore left you a second bequest potter 
 
 what is it asked harry excitement rekindling 
 
 scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time 
 
 the sword of godric gryffindor he said hermione and ron both stiffened harry looked around for a sign of the hilt but scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it 
 
 so where is it harry asked suspiciously 
 
 unfortunately said scrimgeour that sword was not dumbledores to give away the sword of godric gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongsc 
 
 it belongs to harry said hermione hotly it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hatc 
 
 according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor said scrimgeour that does not make it the exclusive property of mr potter whatever dumbledore may have decided scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing harry why do you thinkc 
 
 cdumbledore wanted to give me the sword said harry struggling to keep his temper maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall 
 
 this is not a joke potter growled scrimgeour was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy 
 
 interesting theory said harry has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban so this is what youve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying c i was nearly one of them c voldemort chased me across three countries he killed moody but theres no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you 
 
 you go too far shouted scrimgeour standing up harry jumped to his feet too scrimgeour limped toward harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand it singed a hole in harrys like a lit cigarette 
 
 oi said ron jumping up and raising his own wand but harry said no dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us 
 
 remembered youre not at school have you said scrimgeour breathing hard into harrys face remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a boy to tell me how to do my job its time you learned some respect 
 
 its time you earned it said harry 
 
 the floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and mr and mrs weasley ran in 
 
 we c we thought we heard c began mr weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of harry and the minister virtually nose to nose 
 
 c raised voices panted mrs weasley 
 
 scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from harry glancing at the hole he had made in harrys he seemed to regret his loss of temper 
 
 it c it was nothing he growled i regret your attitude he said looking harry full in the face once more you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you c what dumbledore c desired we ought to work together 
 
 i dont like your methods minister said harry remember 
 
 for the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to scrimgeour the scar that still showed white on the back of it spelling i must not tell lies scrimgeours expression hardened he turned away without another word and limped from the room mrs weasley hurried after him harry heard her stop at the back door after a minute or so she called hes gone 
 
 what did he want mr weasley asked looking around at harry ron and hermione as mrs weasley came hurrying back to them 
 
 to give us what dumbledore left us said harry theyve only just released the content of his will 
 
 outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand everyone exclaimed over the deluminator and the tales of beedle the bard and lamented the fact that scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why dumbledore would have left harry an old snitch as mr weasley examined the deluminator for the third of fourth time mrs weasley said tentatively harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you shall i serve dinner now 
 
 they all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of happy birthday and much gulping of cake the party broke up hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field 
 
 meet us upstairs harry whispered to hermione while they helped mrs weasley restore the garden to its normal state after everyones gone to bed 
 
 up in the attic room ron examined his deluminator and harry filled hagrids moleskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the marauders map the shard of siriuss enchanted mirror and locket he pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly at last hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside 
 
 muffiato she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs 
 
 thought you didnt approve of that spell said ron 
 
 times change said hermione now show us that deluminator 
 
 ron obliged at once holding i up in front of him he clicked it the solitary lamp they had lit went out at once 
 
 the thing is whispered hermione through the dark we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder 
 
 there was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more 
 
 still its cool said ron a little defensively and from what they said dumbledore invented it himself 
 
 i know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights 
 
 dyou think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us asked harry 
 
 definitely said hermione he couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that will doesnt explain 
 
 why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive asked ron 
 
 well exactly said hermione now flicking through the tales of beedle the bard if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry youd think hed have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious 
 
 thought wrong then didnt he said ron i always said he was mental brilliant and everything but cracked leaving harry an old snitch c what the hell was that about 
 
 ive no idea said hermione when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen 
 
 yeah well said harry his pulse quickened as he raised the snitch in his fingers i wasnt going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione 
 
 the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match said harry dont you remember 
 
 hermione looked simply bemused ron however gasped pointing frantically from harry to the snitch and back again until he found his voice 
 
 that was the one you nearly swallowed 
 
 exactly said harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the snitch 
 
 it did not open frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him he lowered the golden sphere but then hermione cried out 
 
 writing theres writing on it quick look he nearly dropped the snitch in surprise and excitement hermione was quite right engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanted handwriting that harry recognized as dumbledores 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 he had barely read them when the words vanished again 
 
 i open at the close whats that supposed to mean 
 
 hermione and ron shook their heads looking blank 
 
 i open at the close at the close i open at the close 
 
 but no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them 
 
 and the sword said ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the snitchs inscription 
 
 why did he want harry to have the sword 
 
 and why couldnt he just have told me harry said quietly i was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year if he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then 
 
 he felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive was there something he had missed in the long talks with dumbledore last year ought he to know what it all meant had dumbledore expected him to understand 
 
 and as for this book said hermione the tales of beedle the bard ive never even heard of them 
 
 youve never heard of the tales of beedle the bard said ron incredulously youre kidding right 
 
 no im not said hermione in surprise do you know them then 
 
 well of course i do 
 
 harry looked up diverted the circumstance of ron having read a book that hermione had not was unprecedented ron however looked bemused by their surprise 
 
 oh come on all the old kids stories are supposed to be beedles arent they the fountain of fair fortune the wizard and the hopping pot babbitty rabbitty and her cackling stump 
 
 excuse me said hermione giggling what was the last one 
 
 come off it said ron looking in disbelief from harry to hermione you mustve heard of babbitty rabbitty c 
 
 ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles said hermione we didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard snow white and the seven dwarves and cinderella c 
 
 whats that an illness asked ron 
 
 so these are childrens stories asked hermione bending against over the runes 
 
 yeah said ron uncertainly i mean just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle i dunno what theyre like in the original versions 
 
 but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them 
 
 something cracked downstairs 
 
 probably just charlie now mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair said ron nervously 
 
 all the same we should get to bed whispered hermione it wouldnt do to oversleep tomorrow 
 
 no agreed ron a brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding ill get the light 
 
 and he clicked the deluminator once more as hermione left the room 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the will of albus dumbledorecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem 
 
 oi wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying again on the camp bed in rons dingy attic room the sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing the scar on harrys forehead was prickling 
 
 you were muttering in your sleep 
 
 was i 
 
 yeah gregorovitch you kept saying gregorovitch 
 
 harry was not wearing his glasses rons face appeared slightly blurred 
 
 whos gregorovitch 
 
 i dunno do i you were the one saying it 
 
 harry rubbed his forehead thinking he had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where 
 
 i think voldemorts looking for him 
 
 poor bloke said ron fervently 
 
 harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake he tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley 
 
 i think hes abroad 
 
 who gregorovitch 
 
 voldemort i think hes somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch it didnt look like anywhere in britain 
 
 you reckon you were seeing into his mind again 
 
 ron sounded worried 
 
 do me a favor and dont tell hermione said harry although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep 
 
 he gazed up at little pigwidgeons cage thinkingwhy was the name gregorovitch familiar 
 
 i think he said slowly hes got something to do with quidditch theres some connection but i cantci cant think what it is 
 
 quidditch said ron sure youre not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 who 
 
 dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago record holder for most quaffle drops in a season 
 
 no said harry im definitely not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 i try not to either said ron well happy birthday anyway 
 
 wow c thats right i forgot im seventeen 
 
 harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said accio glasses although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye 
 
 slick snorted ron 
 
 reveling in the removal of his trace harry sent rons possessions flying around the room causing pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on rons chudley cannons posters bright blue 
 
 id do your fly by hand though ron advised harry sniggering when harry immediately checked it heres your present unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes 
 
 a book said harry as he took the rectangular parcel bit of a departure from tradition isnt it 
 
 this isnt your average book said ron itd pure gold twelve ways to charm witches explains everything you need to know about girls if only id had this last year id have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i wouldve known how to get going with well fred and george gave me a copy and ive learned a lot youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either 
 
 when they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table bill and monsieur delacour were finishing their breakfasts while mrs weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan 
 
 arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry said mrs weasley beaming at him he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner thats our present on top 
 
 harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it inside was a watch very like the one mr and mrs weasley had given ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the race instead of hands 
 
 its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age said mrs weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker im afraid that one isnt new like rons it was actually my brother fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back butc 
 
 the rest of her speech was lost harry had got up and hugged her he tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor 
 
 happy birthday harry said hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile its not much but i hope you like it what did you get him she added to ron who seemed not to hear her 
 
 come on then open hermiones said ron 
 
 she had bought him a new sneakoscope the other packages contained an enchanted razor from bill and fleur ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave monsieur delacour assured him but you must tell it clearly what you wantozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like chocolates from the delacours and an enormous box of the latest weasleys wizard wheezes merchandise from fred and george 
 
 harry ron and hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of madame delacour fleur and gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded 
 
 ill pack these for you hermione said brightly taking harrys presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs im nearly done im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ronc 
 
 rons splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the landing 
 
 harry will you come in here a moment 
 
 it was ginny ron came to an abrupt halt but hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs feeling nervous harry followed ginny into her room 
 
 he had never been inside it before it was small but bright there was a large poster of the wizarding band the weird sisters on one wall and a picture of gwenog jones captain of the quidditch team the holyhead harpies on the other a desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and ginny had once played a quidditch with ron and hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee the golden flag on top was level with ginnys window 
 
 ginny looked up into harrys face took a deep breath and said happy seventeenth 
 
 yeahthanks 
 
 she was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light 
 
 nice view he said feebly pointing toward with window 
 
 she ignored this he could not blame her 
 
 i couldnt think what to get you she said 
 
 you didnt have to get me anything 
 
 she disregarded this too 
 
 i didnt know what would be useful nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you 
 
 he chanced a glance at her she was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about ginny she was rarely weepy he had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up 
 
 she took a step closer to him 
 
 so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing 
 
 i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest 
 
 theres the silver lining ive been looking for she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long hairc the door banged open behind them and they jumped apart 
 
 oh said ron pointedly sorry 
 
 ron hermione was just behind him slight out of breath there was a strained silence then ginny had said in a flat little voice well happy birthday anyway harry 
 
 rons ears were scarlet hermione looked nervous harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble all the reasons for ending his relationship with ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone 
 
 he looked at ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him he thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears he could not do anything to comfort her in front of ron 
 
 ill see you later he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom 
 
 ron marched downstairs though the kitchen and into the yard and harry kept pace with him all the way hermione trotting along behind them looking scared 
 
 once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn ron rounded on harry 
 
 you ditched her what are you doing now messing her around 
 
 im not messing her around said harry as hermione caught up with them 
 
 ronc 
 
 but ron held up a hand to silence her 
 
 she was really cut up when you ended itc 
 
 so was i you know why i stopped it and it wasnt because i wanted to 
 
 yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up againc 
 
 shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us tocto end up married orc 
 
 as he said it a vivid picture formed in harrys mind of ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger 
 
 in one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him her future was free and unencumbered whereas hishe could see nothing but voldemort ahead 
 
 if you keep groping her every chance you getc 
 
 it wont happen again said harry harshly the day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in okay 
 
 ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said right then well thatsyeah 
 
 
 
 
 ginny did not seek another meeting with harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room nevertheless charlies arrival came as a relief to harry it provided a distraction watching mrs weasley force charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut 
 
 as harrys birthday dinner would have stretched the burrows kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of charlie lupin tonks and hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden fred and george bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number to hang in midair over the guests thanks to mrs weasleys ministrations georges wound was neat and clean but harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins many jokes about it 
 
 hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes 
 
 nice said ron as with one final flourish of her wand hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold youve really got an eye for that sort of thing 
 
 thank you ron said hermione looking both pleased and a little confused harry turned away smiling to himself he had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of twelve ways to charm witches he caught ginnys eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with monsieur delacour 
 
 out of the way out of the way sang mrs weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant snitch floating in front of her seconds later harry realized that it was his birthday cake which mrs weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground when the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table harry said that looks amazing mrs weasley 
 
 oh its nothing dear she said fondly over her shoulder ron gave harry the and mouthed good one 
 
 by seven oclock all the guests had arrived led into the house by fred and george who had waited for them at the end of the lane hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit although lupin smiled as he shook harrys hand harry thought he looked rather unhappy it was all very odd tonks beside him looked simply radiant 
 
 happy birthday harry she said hugging him tightly 
 
 seventeen eh said hagrid as he accepted a glass of wine from fred six years ter the day since we met harry dyeh remember it 
 
 vaguely said harry grinning up at him didnt you smash down the front door give dudley a pigs tail and tell me i was a wizard 
 
 i forge the details hagrid chortled all righ ron hermione 
 
 were fine said hermione how are you 
 
 ar not bad bin busy we got some newborn unicorns ill show yeh when yeh get backc harry avoided rons and hermiones gazes as hagrid rummaged in his pocket here harry c couldnt think what ter get teh but then i remembered this he pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck mokeskin hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out theyre rare them 
 
 hagrid thanks 
 
 snothin said hagrid with a wave of a hand an theres charlie always liked him c hey charlie 
 
 charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut he was shorter than ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms 
 
 hi hagrid hows it going 
 
 bin meanin ter write fer ages hows norbert doin 
 
 norbert charlie laughed the norwegian ridgeback we call her norberta now 
 
 wha c norberts a girl 
 
 oh yeah said charlie 
 
 how can you tell asked hermione 
 
 theyre a lot more vicious said charlie he looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice wish dad would hurry up and get here mums getting edgy 
 
 they all looked over at mrs weasley she was trying to talk to madame delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate 
 
 i think wed better start without arthur she called to the garden at large after a moment or two he must have been held up at c oh 
 
 they all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with mr weasleys voice 
 
 minister of magic coming with me 
 
 the patronus dissolved into thin air leaving fleurs family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished 
 
 we shouldnt be here said lupin at once harry c im sorry c ill explain some other timec 
 
 he seized tonkss wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight mrs weasley looked bewildered 
 
 the minister c but whyc i dont understandc 
 
 but there was no time to discuss the matter a second later mr weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by rufus scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair 
 
 the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer as scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light harry saw that he looked much older than the last time that had met scraggy and grim 
 
 sorry to intrude said scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table especially as i can see that i am a party 
 
 his eyes lingered for a moment on the giant snitch cake 
 
 many happy returns 
 
 thanks said harry 
 
 i require a private word with you scrimgeour went on also with mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger 
 
 us said ron sounding surprised why us 
 
 i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private said scrimgeour is there such a place he demanded of mr weasley 
 
 yes of course said mr weasley who looked nervous the er sitting room why dont you use that 
 
 you can lead the way scrimgeour said to ron there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur 
 
 harry saw mr weasley exchange a worried look with mrs weasley as he ron and hermione stood up as they led the way back to the house in silence harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was scrimgeour must somehow had learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of hogwarts 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the burrows sitting room although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that mr weasley normally occupied leaving harry ron and hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa once they had done so scrimgeour spoke 
 
 i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually if you two c he pointed at harry and hermione c can wait upstairs i will start with ronald 
 
 were not going anywhere said harry while hermione nodded vigorously you can speak to us together or not at all 
 
 scrimgeour gave harry a cold appraising look harry had the impression that the minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early 
 
 very well then together he said shrugging he cleared his throat i am here as im sure you know because of albus dumbledores will 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another 
 
 a surprise apparently you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything 
 
 of us said ron me and hermione too 
 
 yes all of c 
 
 but harry interrupted 
 
 dumbledore died over a month ago why has it taken this long to give us what he left us 
 
 isnt it obvious said hermione before scrimgeour could answer they wanted to examine whatever hes left us you had no right to do that she said and her voice trembled slightly 
 
 i had every right said scrimgeour dismissively the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a willc 
 
 that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts said hermione and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed 
 
 are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 no im not retorted hermione im hoping to do some good in the world 
 
 ron laughed scrimgeours eyes flickered toward him and away again as harry spoke 
 
 so why have you decided to let us have our things now cant think of a pretext to keep them 
 
 no itll be because days are up said hermione at once they cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous right 
 
 would you say you were close to dumbledore ronald asked scrimgeour ignoring hermione ron looked startled 
 
 me not c not really it was always harry who 
 
 ron looked around at harry and hermione to see hermione giving him a sort of look but the damage was done scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear he swooped like a bird of prey upon rons answer 
 
 if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests the vast majority of his possessions c his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects c were left to hogwarts why do you think you were singled out 
 
 idunno said ron iwhen i say we werent closei mean i think he liked me 
 
 youre being modest ron said hermione dumbledore was very fond of you 
 
 this was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as harry knew ron and dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible however scrimgeour did not seem to be listening he put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one hagrid had given harry from it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud 
 
 the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore yes here we are to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it 
 
 scrimgeour took from the bag an object that harry had seen before it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the deluminator to ron who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned 
 
 that is a valuable object said scrimgeour watching ron it may even be unique certainly it is of dumbledores own design why would he have left you and item so rare 
 
 ron shook his head looking bewildered 
 
 dumbledore must have taught thousands of students scrimgeour persevered yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three why is that to what use did he think you would put to the deluminator mr weasley 
 
 put out lights i spose mumbled ron what else could i do with it 
 
 evidently scrimgeour had no suggestions after squinting at ron for a moment or tow he turned back to dumbledores will 
 
 to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive 
 
 scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of secrets of the darkest art upstairs its binding was stained and peeling in places hermione took it from scrimgeour without a word she held the book in her lap and gazed at it harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them as he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols 
 
 why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 he he knew i liked books said hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve 
 
 but why that particular book 
 
 i dont know he must have thought id enjoy it 
 
 did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore 
 
 no i didnt said hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve and if the ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in days i doubt that i will 
 
 she suppressed a sob they were wedged together so tightly that ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around hermiones shoulders scrimgeour turned back to the will 
 
 to harry james potter he read and harrys insides contracted with a sudden excitement i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill 
 
 as scrimgeour pulled out the tiny golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax 
 
 why did dumbledore leave you this snitch asked scrimgeour 
 
 no idea said harry for the reasons you just read out i suppose to remind me what you can get if you persevere and whatever it was 
 
 you think this a mere symbolic keepsake then 
 
 i suppose so said harry what else could it be 
 
 im asking the questions said scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge 
 
 i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch scrimgeour said to harry why is that 
 
 hermione laughed derisively 
 
 oh it cant be a reference to the fact harrys a great seeker thats way too obvious she said there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing 
 
 i dont think theres anything hidden in the icing said scrimgeour but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object you know why im sure 
 
 harry shrugged hermione however answered harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge 
 
 because snitches have flesh memories she said 
 
 what said harry and ron together both considered hermiones quidditch knowledge negligible 
 
 correct said scrimgeour a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture this snitch c he held up the tiny golden ball c will remember your touch potter 
 
 it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you 
 
 harrys heart was beating rather fast he was sure that scrimgeour was right how could he avoid taking the snitch with his bare hand in front of the minister 
 
 you dont say anything said scrimgeour perhaps you already know what the snitch contains 
 
 no said harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the snitch without really doing so if only he knew legilimency really knew it and could read hermiones mind he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him 
 
 take it said scrimgeour quietly 
 
 harry met the ministers yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey he held out his hand and scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the snitch slowly and deliberately into harrys palm 
 
 nothing happened as harrys fingers closed around the snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still scrimgeour ron and hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way 
 
 that was dramatic said harry coolly both ron and hermione laughed 
 
 thats all then is it asked hermione making to raise herself off the sofa 
 
 not quite said scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now dumbledore left you a second bequest potter 
 
 what is it asked harry excitement rekindling 
 
 scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time 
 
 the sword of godric gryffindor he said hermione and ron both stiffened harry looked around for a sign of the hilt but scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it 
 
 so where is it harry asked suspiciously 
 
 unfortunately said scrimgeour that sword was not dumbledores to give away the sword of godric gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongsc 
 
 it belongs to harry said hermione hotly it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hatc 
 
 according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor said scrimgeour that does not make it the exclusive property of mr potter whatever dumbledore may have decided scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing harry why do you thinkc 
 
 cdumbledore wanted to give me the sword said harry struggling to keep his temper maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall 
 
 this is not a joke potter growled scrimgeour was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy 
 
 interesting theory said harry has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban so this is what youve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying c i was nearly one of them c voldemort chased me across three countries he killed moody but theres no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you 
 
 you go too far shouted scrimgeour standing up harry jumped to his feet too scrimgeour limped toward harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand it singed a hole in harrys like a lit cigarette 
 
 oi said ron jumping up and raising his own wand but harry said no dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us 
 
 remembered youre not at school have you said scrimgeour breathing hard into harrys face remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a boy to tell me how to do my job its time you learned some respect 
 
 its time you earned it said harry 
 
 the floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and mr and mrs weasley ran in 
 
 we c we thought we heard c began mr weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of harry and the minister virtually nose to nose 
 
 c raised voices panted mrs weasley 
 
 scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from harry glancing at the hole he had made in harrys he seemed to regret his loss of temper 
 
 it c it was nothing he growled i regret your attitude he said looking harry full in the face once more you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you c what dumbledore c desired we ought to work together 
 
 i dont like your methods minister said harry remember 
 
 for the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to scrimgeour the scar that still showed white on the back of it spelling i must not tell lies scrimgeours expression hardened he turned away without another word and limped from the room mrs weasley hurried after him harry heard her stop at the back door after a minute or so she called hes gone 
 
 what did he want mr weasley asked looking around at harry ron and hermione as mrs weasley came hurrying back to them 
 
 to give us what dumbledore left us said harry theyve only just released the content of his will 
 
 outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand everyone exclaimed over the deluminator and the tales of beedle the bard and lamented the fact that scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why dumbledore would have left harry an old snitch as mr weasley examined the deluminator for the third of fourth time mrs weasley said tentatively harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you shall i serve dinner now 
 
 they all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of happy birthday and much gulping of cake the party broke up hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field 
 
 meet us upstairs harry whispered to hermione while they helped mrs weasley restore the garden to its normal state after everyones gone to bed 
 
 up in the attic room ron examined his deluminator and harry filled hagrids moleskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the marauders map the shard of siriuss enchanted mirror and locket he pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly at last hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside 
 
 muffiato she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs 
 
 thought you didnt approve of that spell said ron 
 
 times change said hermione now show us that deluminator 
 
 ron obliged at once holding i up in front of him he clicked it the solitary lamp they had lit went out at once 
 
 the thing is whispered hermione through the dark we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder 
 
 there was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more 
 
 still its cool said ron a little defensively and from what they said dumbledore invented it himself 
 
 i know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights 
 
 dyou think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us asked harry 
 
 definitely said hermione he couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that will doesnt explain 
 
 why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive asked ron 
 
 well exactly said hermione now flicking through the tales of beedle the bard if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry youd think hed have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious 
 
 thought wrong then didnt he said ron i always said he was mental brilliant and everything but cracked leaving harry an old snitch c what the hell was that about 
 
 ive no idea said hermione when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen 
 
 yeah well said harry his pulse quickened as he raised the snitch in his fingers i wasnt going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione 
 
 the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match said harry dont you remember 
 
 hermione looked simply bemused ron however gasped pointing frantically from harry to the snitch and back again until he found his voice 
 
 that was the one you nearly swallowed 
 
 exactly said harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the snitch 
 
 it did not open frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him he lowered the golden sphere but then hermione cried out 
 
 writing theres writing on it quick look he nearly dropped the snitch in surprise and excitement hermione was quite right engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanted handwriting that harry recognized as dumbledores 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 he had barely read them when the words vanished again 
 
 i open at the close whats that supposed to mean 
 
 hermione and ron shook their heads looking blank 
 
 i open at the close at the close i open at the close 
 
 but no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them 
 
 and the sword said ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the snitchs inscription 
 
 why did he want harry to have the sword 
 
 and why couldnt he just have told me harry said quietly i was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year if he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then 
 
 he felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive was there something he had missed in the long talks with dumbledore last year ought he to know what it all meant had dumbledore expected him to understand 
 
 and as for this book said hermione the tales of beedle the bard ive never even heard of them 
 
 youve never heard of the tales of beedle the bard said ron incredulously youre kidding right 
 
 no im not said hermione in surprise do you know them then 
 
 well of course i do 
 
 harry looked up diverted the circumstance of ron having read a book that hermione had not was unprecedented ron however looked bemused by their surprise 
 
 oh come on all the old kids stories are supposed to be beedles arent they the fountain of fair fortune the wizard and the hopping pot babbitty rabbitty and her cackling stump 
 
 excuse me said hermione giggling what was the last one 
 
 come off it said ron looking in disbelief from harry to hermione you mustve heard of babbitty rabbitty c 
 
 ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles said hermione we didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard snow white and the seven dwarves and cinderella c 
 
 whats that an illness asked ron 
 
 so these are childrens stories asked hermione bending against over the runes 
 
 yeah said ron uncertainly i mean just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle i dunno what theyre like in the original versions 
 
 but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them 
 
 something cracked downstairs 
 
 probably just charlie now mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair said ron nervously 
 
 all the same we should get to bed whispered hermione it wouldnt do to oversleep tomorrow 
 
 no agreed ron a brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding ill get the light 
 
 and he clicked the deluminator once more as hermione left the room 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 anne lisbeth 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 anne lisbeth was a beautiful young woman with a red and white 
 complexion glittering white teeth and clear soft eyes and her 
 footstep was light in the dance but her mind was lighter still she 
 had a little child not at all pretty so he was put out to be 
 nursed by a wife and his mother went to the castle 
 she sat in splendid rooms richly decorated with silk and velvet 
 not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her and no one was 
 allowed to speak to her harshly for she was nurse to the 
 child he was fair and delicate as a prince and beautiful as an 
 angel and how she loved this child her own boy was provided for by being at the where the mouth watered more frequently than the pot boiled and where in general no one was at home to take care of the child then he would cry but what nobody knows nobody cares for so he would cry till he was tired and then fall asleep and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst ah yes sleep is a capital invention 
 
 as years went on anne child grew apace like weeds 
 although they said his growth had been stunted he had become quite 
 a member of the family in which he dwelt they received money to 
 keep him so that his mother got rid of him altogether she had become quite a lady she had a comfortable home of her own in the town and out of doors when she went for a walk she wore a bonnet but she never walked out to see the laborer that was too far from the town and indeed she had nothing to go for the boy now belonged to these laboring people he had food and he could also do something towards earning his living he took care of red cow for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful 
 
 the great dog by the yard gate of a mansion sits 
 proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines and barks at 
 every one that passes but if it rains he creeps into his house 
 and there he is warm and dry anne boy also sat in the 
 sunshine on the top of the fence cutting out a little toy if it 
 was he knew of three in blossom 
 which would certainly bear fruit this was his most hopeful thought 
 though it often came to nothing and he had to sit out in the rain 
 in the worst weather and get wet to the skin and let the cold wind 
 dry the clothes on his back afterwards if he went near the farmyard 
 belonging to the count he was pushed and knocked about for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly but he was used to all this for nobody loved him this was how the world treated anne 
 boy and how could it be otherwise it was his fate to be 
 beloved by no one hitherto he had been a land crab the land at 
 last cast him adrift he went to sea in a wretched vessel and sat 
 at the helm while the skipper sat over the he was dirty and 
 ugly and he always looked as if he never 
 had enough to eat which was really the case 
 
 late in the autumn when the weather was rough windy and wet 
 and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing especially at 
 sea a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board or 
 more correctly a man and a half for it was the skipper and his 
 boy there had only been a kind of twilight all day and it soon 
 grew quite dark and so bitterly cold that the skipper took a dram to 
 warm him the bottle was old and the glass too it was perfect in the 
 upper part but the foot was broken off and it had therefore been 
 fixed upon a little carved block of wood painted blue a dram is a 
 great comfort and two are better still thought the skipper while 
 the boy sat at the helm which he held fast in his hard seamed 
 hands he was ugly and his hair was matted and he looked crippled 
 and stunted they called him the boy though in the 
 church register he was entered as anne son the wind cut 
 through the rigging and the boat cut through the sea the sails 
 filled by the wind swelled out and carried them along in wild career 
 it was wet and rough above and below and might still be worse 
 hold what is that what has struck the boat was it a waterspout 
 or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them 
 
 heaven help us cried the boy at the helm as the boat heeled 
 over and lay on its beam ends it had struck on a rock which rose 
 from the depths of the sea and sank at once like an old shoe in a 
 puddle it sank at once with mouse and man as the saying is 
 there might have been mice on board but only one man and a half 
 the skipper and the boy no one saw it but the skimming 
 and the fishes beneath the water and even they did not 
 see it properly for they darted back with terror as the boat filled 
 with water and sank there it lay scarcely a fathom below the 
 surface and those two were provided for buried and forgotten the 
 glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink 
 for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the 
 shore and broken where and when is indeed of no consequence it 
 had served its purpose and it had been loved which anne 
 boy had not been but in heaven no soul will be able to say never 
 loved 
 
 anne lisbeth had now lived in the town many years she was 
 called madame and felt dignified in consequence she remembered the old noble days in which she had driven in the carriage and had 
 associated with countess and baroness her beautiful noble child 
 had been a dear angel and possessed the kindest heart he had loved 
 her so much and she had loved him in return they had kissed and 
 loved each other and the boy had been her joy her second life now 
 he was fourteen years of age tall handsome and clever she had 
 not seen him since she carried him in her arms neither had she been 
 for years to the palace it was quite a journey thither from 
 the town 
 
 i must make one effort to go said anne lisbeth to see my 
 darling the sweet child and press him to my heart certainly 
 he must long to see me too the young count no doubt he thinks of me and loves me as in those days when he would fling his 
 round my neck and lisp anne liz it was music to my ears yes i 
 must make an effort to see him again she drove across the country in a cart and then got out and continued her journey on foot and thus reached the castle it was as great and magnificent as it had always been and the garden looked the same as ever all the servants were strangers to her not one of them knew anne lisbeth nor of what consequence she had once been there but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it and her darling boy too how she longed to see him 
 
 now that anne lisbeth was at her end she was kept 
 waiting a long time and for those who wait time passes slowly but 
 before the great people went in to dinner she was called in and 
 spoken to very graciously she was to go in again after dinner and 
 then she would see her sweet boy once more how tall and slender and thin he had grown but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were still beautiful he looked at her but he did not speak he certainly did 
 not know who she was he turned round and was going away but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips 
 
 well well he said and with that he walked out of the room he 
 who filled her every thought he whom she loved best and who was 
 her whole earthly pride 
 
 anne lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road 
 feeling mournful and sad he whom she had nursed day and night and 
 even now carried about in her dreams had been cold and strange and had not a word or thought respecting her a great black raven darted down in front of her on the high road and croaked dismally 
 ah said she what bird of ill omen art thou presently she 
 passed the hut his wife stood at the door and the two 
 women spoke to each other 
 
 you look well said the woman fat and plump you are 
 well off 
 
 oh yes answered anne lisbeth 
 
 the boat went down with them continued the woman hans the 
 skipper and the boy were both drowned so an end of them i 
 always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars 
 never cost you anything more anne lisbeth 
 
 so they were drowned repeated anne lisbeth but she said no 
 more and the subject was dropped she felt very because her had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well and who had travelled so far to see him the journey had cost money too and she had derived no great pleasure from it still she said not a word of all this she could not relieve her heart by telling the wife lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle then the raven flew over her screaming again as he flew 
 
 the black wretch said anne lisbeth he will end by frightening 
 me today she had brought coffee and chicory with her for she 
 thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee and then she would take a cup herself 
 
 the woman prepared the coffee and in the meantime anne lisbeth 
 seated her in a chair and fell asleep then she dreamed of something 
 which she had never dreamed before singularly enough she dreamed of her own child who had wept and hungered in the hut and had been knocked about in heat and in cold and who was now lying in the depths of the sea in a spot only known by god she fancied she was still sitting in the hut where the woman was busy preparing the coffee for she could smell the roasting but suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a 
 beautiful young form as beautiful as the child and this 
 apparition said to her the world is passing away hold fast to me 
 for you are my mother after all you have an angel in heaven hold 
 me fast and the stretched out his hand and seized her 
 then there was a terrible crash as of a world crumbling to pieces 
 and the was rising from the earth and holding her by 
 the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 but on the other hand something heavy hung to her feet and dragged 
 her down and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to 
 her and crying if thou art to be saved we must be saved too 
 hold fast hold fast and then they all hung on her but there were 
 too many and as they clung the sleeve was torn and anne lisbeth fell down in horror and awoke indeed she was on the point of falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat but she was so startled 
 and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed only 
 that it was something very dreadful 
 
 they drank their coffee and had a chat together and then anne 
 lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the 
 carrier who was to drive her back to her own home but when she 
 came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the 
 evening of the next day then she began to think of the expense and 
 what the distance would be to walk she remembered that the route by the was two miles shorter than by the high road and as 
 the weather was clear and there would be moonlight she determined to make her way on foot and to start at once that she might reach 
 home the next day 
 
 the sun had set and the evening bells sounded through the air 
 from the tower of the village church but to her it was not the bells 
 but the cry of the frogs in the marshes then they ceased and all 
 around became still not a bird could be heard they were all at rest 
 even the owl had not left her hiding place deep silence reigned on 
 the margin of the wood by the as anne lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands even the waves of the sea were at rest and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence 
 
 there was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea anne 
 lisbeth walked on thinking of nothing at all as people say or 
 rather her thoughts wandered but not away from her for thought is 
 never absent from us it only slumbers many thoughts that have lain 
 dormant are roused at the proper time and begin to stir in the mind 
 and the heart and seem even to come upon us from above it is 
 written that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit and it is 
 also written that the wages of sin is death much has been said and 
 much written which we pass over or know nothing of a light arises 
 within us and then forgotten things make themselves remembered and thus it was with anne lisbeth the germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our heart in yours and in mine they lie like little grains 
 of seed till a ray of sunshine or the touch of an evil hand or 
 you turn the corner to the right or to the left and the decision is 
 made the little seed is stirred it swells and shoots up and pours 
 its sap into your blood directing your course either for good or 
 evil troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind fermenting 
 there which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were 
 slumbering but still they are there anne lisbeth walked on thus with 
 her senses half asleep but the thoughts were fermenting within her 
 from one shrove tuesday to another much may occur to weigh down the heart it is the reckoning of a whole year much may be forgotten sins against heaven in word and thought sins against our neighbor and against our own conscience we are scarcely aware of their existence and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors 
 she had committed no crime against the law of the land she was an 
 honorable person in a good position that she knew 
 
 she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea what was it 
 she saw lying there an old hat a hat now when might that have been washed overboard she drew nearer she stopped to look at the hat ha what was lying yonder she shuddered yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone but it looked like a corpse only tangled grass and yet she was 
 frightened at it as she turned to walk away much came into her 
 mind that she had heard in her childhood old superstitions of 
 spectres by the of the ghosts of drowned but unburied 
 people whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach 
 the body she knew could do no harm to any one but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer attach itself to him and demand to be carried to the churchyard that it might rest in consecrated ground 
 hold fast hold fast the spectre would cry and as anne lisbeth 
 murmured these words to herself the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory when the mother had clung to her and uttered these words when amid the crashing of worlds her sleeve had been torn and she had slipped from the grasp of her child who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour her child her own child which she had never loved lay now buried in the sea and might rise up like a spectre from the waters and cry hold fast carry me 
 to consecrated ground 
 
 as these thoughts passed through her mind fear gave speed to 
 her feet so that she walked faster and faster fear came upon her 
 as if a cold clammy hand had been laid upon her heart so that she 
 almost fainted as she looked across the sea all there grew darker a 
 heavy mist came rolling onwards and clung to bush and tree 
 distorting them into fantastic shapes she turned and glanced at the 
 moon which had risen behind her it looked like a pale rayless 
 surface and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs hold 
 thought she and then she turned round a second time to look at the 
 moon a white face appeared quite close to her with a mist hanging 
 like a garment from its shoulders stop carry me to consecrated 
 earth sounded in her ears in strange hollow tones the sound did 
 not come from frogs or ravens she saw no sign of such creatures 
 a grave dig me a grave was repeated quite loud yes it was indeed the spectre of her child the child that lay beneath the ocean and whose spirit could have no rest until it was carried to the 
 churchyard and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated 
 ground she would go there at once and there she would dig she 
 turned in the direction of the church and the weight on her heart 
 seemed to grow lighter and even to vanish altogether but when she 
 turned to go home by the shortest way it returned stop stop 
 and the words came quite clear though they were like the croak of a 
 frog or the wail of a bird a grave dig me a grave 
 
 the mist was cold and damp her hands and face were moist and 
 clammy with horror a heavy weight again seized her and clung to 
 her her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been 
 there 
 
 in these northern regions a often buds in a single 
 night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory of 
 youthful green so in a single instant can the consciousness of 
 the sin that has been committed in thoughts words and actions of our past life be unfolded to us when once the conscience is awakened it springs up in the heart spontaneously and god awakens the conscience when we least expect it then we can find no excuse for ourselves the deed is there and bears witness against us the 
 thoughts seem to become words and to sound far out into the world 
 we are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has its 
 origin in thoughtlessness and pride the heart conceals within 
 itself the vices as well as the virtues and they grow in the shallowest ground anne lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words she was overpowered by them and sank down 
 and crept along for some distance on the ground a grave dig me a 
 grave sounded again in her ears and she would have gladly buried 
 herself if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of her 
 actions 
 
 it was the first hour of her awakening full of anguish and 
 horror superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn 
 with the heat of fever many things of which she had feared even to 
 speak came into her mind silently as the in the 
 moonshine a spectral apparition flitted by her she had heard of it 
 before close by her galloped four snorting steeds with fire flashing 
 from their eyes and nostrils they dragged a burning coach and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor who had ruled there a hundred years before the legend says that every night at twelve he drove into his castleyard and out again he was not as pale as dead men are but black as a coal he nodded and pointed to

 she gathered herself up and hastened to the churchyard but black 
 crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes and she could not 
 distinguish one from the other the ravens croaked as the raven had 
 done which she saw in the daytime but now she understood what they said i am the i am the each raven 
 croaked and anne lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her 
 and she fancied she should be transformed into a black bird and 
 have to cry as they cried if she did not dig the grave and she threw 
 herself upon the earth and with her hands dug a grave in the hard 
 ground so that the blood ran from her fingers a grave dig me a 
 grave still sounded in her ears she was fearful that the cock might 
 crow and the first red streak appear in the east before she had 
 finished her work and then she would be lost and the cock crowed 
 and the day dawned in the east and the grave was only half dug an 
 icy hand passed over her head and face and down towards her heart 
 only half a grave a voice wailed and fled away yes it fled 
 away over the sea it was the ocean spectre and exhausted and 
 overpowered anne lisbeth sunk to the ground and her senses left her 
 
 it was a bright day when she came to herself and two men were 
 raising her up but she was not lying in the churchyard but on the 
 where she had dug a deep hole in the sand and cut her hand with a piece of broken glass whose sharp stern was stuck in a 
 little block of painted wood anne lisbeth was in a fever 
 
 conscience had roused the memories of superstitions and had so 
 acted upon her mind that she fancied she had only half a soul and 
 that her child had taken the other half down into the sea never would 
 she be able to cling to the mercy of heaven till she had recovered 
 this other half which was now held fast in the deep water 
 
 anne lisbeth returned to her home but she was no longer the woman 
 she had been her thoughts were like a confused tangled skein only 
 one thread only one thought was clear to her namely that she must 
 carry the spectre of the to the churchyard and dig a 
 grave for him there that by so doing she might win back her soul 
 
 many a night she was missed from her home and was always found on the waiting for the spectre 
 
 in this way a whole year passed and then one night she vanished 
 again and was not to be found the whole of the next day was spent in a useless search after her 
 
 towards evening when the clerk entered the church to toll the 
 vesper bell he saw by the altar anne lisbeth who had spent the whole day there her powers of body were almost exhausted but her eyes flashed brightly and on her cheeks was a rosy flush the last rays of the setting sun shone upon her and gleamed over the altar upon the shining clasps of the bible which lay open at the words of the prophet joel rend your hearts and not your garments and turn unto the lord 
 
 that was just a chance people said but do things happen by 
 chance in the face of anne lisbeth lighted up by the evening sun 
 could be seen peace and rest she said she was happy now for she 
 had conquered the spectre of the shore her own child had come to 
 her the night before and had said to her thou hast dug me only half 
 a grave but thou hast now for a year and a day buried me altogether 
 in thy heart and it is there a mother can best hide her child and 
 then he gave her back her lost soul and brought her into the church now i am in the house of god she said and in that house 
 we are happy 
 
 when the sun set anne soul had risen to that region 
 where there is no more pain and anne troubles were at an

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 anne lisbeth 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 anne lisbeth was a beautiful young woman with a red and white 
 complexion glittering white teeth and clear soft eyes and her 
 footstep was light in the dance but her mind was lighter still she 
 had a little child not at all pretty so he was put out to be 
 nursed by a wife and his mother went to the castle 
 she sat in splendid rooms richly decorated with silk and velvet 
 not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her and no one was 
 allowed to speak to her harshly for she was nurse to the 
 child he was fair and delicate as a prince and beautiful as an 
 angel and how she loved this child her own boy was provided for by being at the where the mouth watered more frequently than the pot boiled and where in general no one was at home to take care of the child then he would cry but what nobody knows nobody cares for so he would cry till he was tired and then fall asleep and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst ah yes sleep is a capital invention 
 
 as years went on anne child grew apace like weeds 
 although they said his growth had been stunted he had become quite 
 a member of the family in which he dwelt they received money to 
 keep him so that his mother got rid of him altogether she had become quite a lady she had a comfortable home of her own in the town and out of doors when she went for a walk she wore a bonnet but she never walked out to see the laborer that was too far from the town and indeed she had nothing to go for the boy now belonged to these laboring people he had food and he could also do something towards earning his living he took care of red cow for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful 
 
 the great dog by the yard gate of a mansion sits 
 proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines and barks at 
 every one that passes but if it rains he creeps into his house 
 and there he is warm and dry anne boy also sat in the 
 sunshine on the top of the fence cutting out a little toy if it 
 was he knew of three in blossom 
 which would certainly bear fruit this was his most hopeful thought 
 though it often came to nothing and he had to sit out in the rain 
 in the worst weather and get wet to the skin and let the cold wind 
 dry the clothes on his back afterwards if he went near the farmyard 
 belonging to the count he was pushed and knocked about for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly but he was used to all this for nobody loved him this was how the world treated anne 
 boy and how could it be otherwise it was his fate to be 
 beloved by no one hitherto he had been a land crab the land at 
 last cast him adrift he went to sea in a wretched vessel and sat 
 at the helm while the skipper sat over the he was dirty and 
 ugly and he always looked as if he never 
 had enough to eat which was really the case 
 
 late in the autumn when the weather was rough windy and wet 
 and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing especially at 
 sea a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board or 
 more correctly a man and a half for it was the skipper and his 
 boy there had only been a kind of twilight all day and it soon 
 grew quite dark and so bitterly cold that the skipper took a dram to 
 warm him the bottle was old and the glass too it was perfect in the 
 upper part but the foot was broken off and it had therefore been 
 fixed upon a little carved block of wood painted blue a dram is a 
 great comfort and two are better still thought the skipper while 
 the boy sat at the helm which he held fast in his hard seamed 
 hands he was ugly and his hair was matted and he looked crippled 
 and stunted they called him the boy though in the 
 church register he was entered as anne son the wind cut 
 through the rigging and the boat cut through the sea the sails 
 filled by the wind swelled out and carried them along in wild career 
 it was wet and rough above and below and might still be worse 
 hold what is that what has struck the boat was it a waterspout 
 or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them 
 
 heaven help us cried the boy at the helm as the boat heeled 
 over and lay on its beam ends it had struck on a rock which rose 
 from the depths of the sea and sank at once like an old shoe in a 
 puddle it sank at once with mouse and man as the saying is 
 there might have been mice on board but only one man and a half 
 the skipper and the boy no one saw it but the skimming 
 and the fishes beneath the water and even they did not 
 see it properly for they darted back with terror as the boat filled 
 with water and sank there it lay scarcely a fathom below the 
 surface and those two were provided for buried and forgotten the 
 glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink 
 for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the 
 shore and broken where and when is indeed of no consequence it 
 had served its purpose and it had been loved which anne 
 boy had not been but in heaven no soul will be able to say never 
 loved 
 
 anne lisbeth had now lived in the town many years she was 
 called madame and felt dignified in consequence she remembered the old noble days in which she had driven in the carriage and had 
 associated with countess and baroness her beautiful noble child 
 had been a dear angel and possessed the kindest heart he had loved 
 her so much and she had loved him in return they had kissed and 
 loved each other and the boy had been her joy her second life now 
 he was fourteen years of age tall handsome and clever she had 
 not seen him since she carried him in her arms neither had she been 
 for years to the palace it was quite a journey thither from 
 the town 
 
 i must make one effort to go said anne lisbeth to see my 
 darling the sweet child and press him to my heart certainly 
 he must long to see me too the young count no doubt he thinks of me and loves me as in those days when he would fling his 
 round my neck and lisp anne liz it was music to my ears yes i 
 must make an effort to see him again she drove across the country in a cart and then got out and continued her journey on foot and thus reached the castle it was as great and magnificent as it had always been and the garden looked the same as ever all the servants were strangers to her not one of them knew anne lisbeth nor of what consequence she had once been there but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it and her darling boy too how she longed to see him 
 
 now that anne lisbeth was at her end she was kept 
 waiting a long time and for those who wait time passes slowly but 
 before the great people went in to dinner she was called in and 
 spoken to very graciously she was to go in again after dinner and 
 then she would see her sweet boy once more how tall and slender and thin he had grown but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were still beautiful he looked at her but he did not speak he certainly did 
 not know who she was he turned round and was going away but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips 
 
 well well he said and with that he walked out of the room he 
 who filled her every thought he whom she loved best and who was 
 her whole earthly pride 
 
 anne lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road 
 feeling mournful and sad he whom she had nursed day and night and 
 even now carried about in her dreams had been cold and strange and had not a word or thought respecting her a great black raven darted down in front of her on the high road and croaked dismally 
 ah said she what bird of ill omen art thou presently she 
 passed the hut his wife stood at the door and the two 
 women spoke to each other 
 
 you look well said the woman fat and plump you are 
 well off 
 
 oh yes answered anne lisbeth 
 
 the boat went down with them continued the woman hans the 
 skipper and the boy were both drowned so an end of them i 
 always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars 
 never cost you anything more anne lisbeth 
 
 so they were drowned repeated anne lisbeth but she said no 
 more and the subject was dropped she felt very because her had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well and who had travelled so far to see him the journey had cost money too and she had derived no great pleasure from it still she said not a word of all this she could not relieve her heart by telling the wife lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle then the raven flew over her screaming again as he flew 
 
 the black wretch said anne lisbeth he will end by frightening 
 me today she had brought coffee and chicory with her for she 
 thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee and then she would take a cup herself 
 
 the woman prepared the coffee and in the meantime anne lisbeth 
 seated her in a chair and fell asleep then she dreamed of something 
 which she had never dreamed before singularly enough she dreamed of her own child who had wept and hungered in the hut and had been knocked about in heat and in cold and who was now lying in the depths of the sea in a spot only known by god she fancied she was still sitting in the hut where the woman was busy preparing the coffee for she could smell the roasting but suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a 
 beautiful young form as beautiful as the child and this 
 apparition said to her the world is passing away hold fast to me 
 for you are my mother after all you have an angel in heaven hold 
 me fast and the stretched out his hand and seized her 
 then there was a terrible crash as of a world crumbling to pieces 
 and the was rising from the earth and holding her by 
 the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 but on the other hand something heavy hung to her feet and dragged 
 her down and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to 
 her and crying if thou art to be saved we must be saved too 
 hold fast hold fast and then they all hung on her but there were 
 too many and as they clung the sleeve was torn and anne lisbeth fell down in horror and awoke indeed she was on the point of falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat but she was so startled 
 and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed only 
 that it was something very dreadful 
 
 they drank their coffee and had a chat together and then anne 
 lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the 
 carrier who was to drive her back to her own home but when she 
 came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the 
 evening of the next day then she began to think of the expense and 
 what the distance would be to walk she remembered that the route by the was two miles shorter than by the high road and as 
 the weather was clear and there would be moonlight she determined to make her way on foot and to start at once that she might reach 
 home the next day 
 
 the sun had set and the evening bells sounded through the air 
 from the tower of the village church but to her it was not the bells 
 but the cry of the frogs in the marshes then they ceased and all 
 around became still not a bird could be heard they were all at rest 
 even the owl had not left her hiding place deep silence reigned on 
 the margin of the wood by the as anne lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands even the waves of the sea were at rest and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence 
 
 there was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea anne 
 lisbeth walked on thinking of nothing at all as people say or 
 rather her thoughts wandered but not away from her for thought is 
 never absent from us it only slumbers many thoughts that have lain 
 dormant are roused at the proper time and begin to stir in the mind 
 and the heart and seem even to come upon us from above it is 
 written that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit and it is 
 also written that the wages of sin is death much has been said and 
 much written which we pass over or know nothing of a light arises 
 within us and then forgotten things make themselves remembered and thus it was with anne lisbeth the germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our heart in yours and in mine they lie like little grains 
 of seed till a ray of sunshine or the touch of an evil hand or 
 you turn the corner to the right or to the left and the decision is 
 made the little seed is stirred it swells and shoots up and pours 
 its sap into your blood directing your course either for good or 
 evil troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind fermenting 
 there which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were 
 slumbering but still they are there anne lisbeth walked on thus with 
 her senses half asleep but the thoughts were fermenting within her 
 from one shrove tuesday to another much may occur to weigh down the heart it is the reckoning of a whole year much may be forgotten sins against heaven in word and thought sins against our neighbor and against our own conscience we are scarcely aware of their existence and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors 
 she had committed no crime against the law of the land she was an 
 honorable person in a good position that she knew 
 
 she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea what was it 
 she saw lying there an old hat a hat now when might that have been washed overboard she drew nearer she stopped to look at the hat ha what was lying yonder she shuddered yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone but it looked like a corpse only tangled grass and yet she was 
 frightened at it as she turned to walk away much came into her 
 mind that she had heard in her childhood old superstitions of 
 spectres by the of the ghosts of drowned but unburied 
 people whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach 
 the body she knew could do no harm to any one but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer attach itself to him and demand to be carried to the churchyard that it might rest in consecrated ground 
 hold fast hold fast the spectre would cry and as anne lisbeth 
 murmured these words to herself the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory when the mother had clung to her and uttered these words when amid the crashing of worlds her sleeve had been torn and she had slipped from the grasp of her child who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour her child her own child which she had never loved lay now buried in the sea and might rise up like a spectre from the waters and cry hold fast carry me 
 to consecrated ground 
 
 as these thoughts passed through her mind fear gave speed to 
 her feet so that she walked faster and faster fear came upon her 
 as if a cold clammy hand had been laid upon her heart so that she 
 almost fainted as she looked across the sea all there grew darker a 
 heavy mist came rolling onwards and clung to bush and tree 
 distorting them into fantastic shapes she turned and glanced at the 
 moon which had risen behind her it looked like a pale rayless 
 surface and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs hold 
 thought she and then she turned round a second time to look at the 
 moon a white face appeared quite close to her with a mist hanging 
 like a garment from its shoulders stop carry me to consecrated 
 earth sounded in her ears in strange hollow tones the sound did 
 not come from frogs or ravens she saw no sign of such creatures 
 a grave dig me a grave was repeated quite loud yes it was indeed the spectre of her child the child that lay beneath the ocean and whose spirit could have no rest until it was carried to the 
 churchyard and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated 
 ground she would go there at once and there she would dig she 
 turned in the direction of the church and the weight on her heart 
 seemed to grow lighter and even to vanish altogether but when she 
 turned to go home by the shortest way it returned stop stop 
 and the words came quite clear though they were like the croak of a 
 frog or the wail of a bird a grave dig me a grave 
 
 the mist was cold and damp her hands and face were moist and 
 clammy with horror a heavy weight again seized her and clung to 
 her her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been 
 there 
 
 in these northern regions a often buds in a single 
 night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory of 
 youthful green so in a single instant can the consciousness of 
 the sin that has been committed in thoughts words and actions of our past life be unfolded to us when once the conscience is awakened it springs up in the heart spontaneously and god awakens the conscience when we least expect it then we can find no excuse for ourselves the deed is there and bears witness against us the 
 thoughts seem to become words and to sound far out into the world 
 we are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has its 
 origin in thoughtlessness and pride the heart conceals within 
 itself the vices as well as the virtues and they grow in the shallowest ground anne lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words she was overpowered by them and sank down 
 and crept along for some distance on the ground a grave dig me a 
 grave sounded again in her ears and she would have gladly buried 
 herself if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of her 
 actions 
 
 it was the first hour of her awakening full of anguish and 
 horror superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn 
 with the heat of fever many things of which she had feared even to 
 speak came into her mind silently as the in the 
 moonshine a spectral apparition flitted by her she had heard of it 
 before close by her galloped four snorting steeds with fire flashing 
 from their eyes and nostrils they dragged a burning coach and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor who had ruled there a hundred years before the legend says that every night at twelve he drove into his castleyard and out again he was not as pale as dead men are but black as a coal he nodded and pointed to 
 anne lisbeth crying out hold fast hold fast and then you may ride again in a carriage and forget your child 
 
 she gathered herself up and hastened to the churchyard but black 
 crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes and she could not

 part 
 
 int infirmary day 
 andy lies wrapped in bandages 
 red 
 andy spent a month in traction 
 int solitary confinement day 
 red 
 bogs spent a week in the hole 
 bogs sits on bare concrete the steel door slides open 
 guard 
 up bogs 
 int cellblock five rd tier dusk 
 bogs comes up the stairs smoking a cigarette not many cons around the place is virtually deserted a voice echoes dimly over the system 
 voice 
 return to your cellblocks for evening count 
 bogs enters his cell dark in here he fumbles for the light cord yanks it the sudden light reveals captain hadley six inches from his face waiting for him mert steps in behind bogs hemming him 
 before bogs can even open his mouth to say what the fuck hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus bogs doubles over gagging his wind out 
 ground floor 
 ernie comes slowly around the corner rolling a steel mop cart loaded with supplies 
 nd tier 
 red is darning a sock in his open cell he pauses frowning hearing strange thumping sounds what the hell is that 
 rd tier 
 hadley and mert methodically and brutally pulping bogs with their batons and kicking the shit out of him for good measure he feebly tries to ward them off 
 nd tier 
 puzzled red steps from his cell following the sound it dawns on him that coming from above he moves to the railing and leans out craning around to look up 
 pov 
 just as bogs flips over the railing and comes sailingdirectly toward us eyes bugging out screaming as he falls 
 red slow motion 
 jumps back as bogs plummets past missing him by inches arms 
 swimming and trying to grab the railing but missing that too screaming aaaaalll the way down 
 ground floor 
 and impacting on gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers the cart is squashed flat shooting out from under bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink kicking up sparks for thirty yards ernie is left gaping in shock at bogs and all the wreckage at his feet 
 nd tier 
 red is stunned he very tentatively leans out and looks up above him hadley and mert lean on the rd tier railing hadley tilts the cap back on his head shakes his head 
 mert 
 damn byron that 
 hadley 
 poor fella tripped 
 a tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of shoe and splashes across upturned cheek he wipes it off then looks down at bogs cons and guards are racing to the scene 
 red 
 two things never happened again after that the sisters never laid a finger on andy again 
 b ext prison dock day 
 bogs and wearing a neck brace is loaded onto an ambulance for transport behind the fence stand red and his friends watching 
 red 
 and bogs never walked again they transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate to my knowledge he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw 
 red 
 thinkin andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of 
 the infirmary 
 heywood 
 sounds good to us figure we owe him for the beer 
 red 
 man likes to play chess get him some rocks 
 ext field day 
 a hundred cons at work hoes rise and fall in long waves 
 guards patrol on horseback heywood turns up a rocky chunk 
 quickly shoves it down his pants he maneuvers to red and the 
 others pulls out the chunk and shows it to them 
 floyd 
 that quartz nor limestone 
 heywood 
 what are you fuckin geologist 
 snooze 
 right it 
 heywood 
 what the hell is it then 
 red 
 horse apple 
 heywood 
 bullshit 
 red 
 no horse shit petrified 
 cackling the men go back to work heywood stares at the rock he crumbles it in his hands 
 red 
 despite a few hitches the boys came through in fine style 
 int prison laundry back room day 
 a huge detergent box is filled with rocks hidden in the shadows behind a boiler furnace 
 red 
 and by the week andy was due back we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture 
 angle shifts to red as he plops a bag of laundry on the floor leonard and bob toss a few more down red starts pulling out contraband giving them their commissions 
 red 
 also got a big shipment in that week cigarettes chewing gum 
 shoelaces playing cards with naked ladies on em you name it 
 pulls a cardboard tube 
 and of course the most important item 
 int cellblock five night 
 andy limping a bit returns from the infirmary red watches from his cell as andy is brought up and locked away 
 int cell night 
 andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk 
 guard 
 lights out 
 the lights go off andy opens the tube and pulls out a large rolled poster he lets it uncurl to the floor a small scrap of paper flutters out landing at his feet the poster is the famous rita hayworth one hand behind her head eyes half closed sulky lips parted andy picks up the scrap of paper it reads no charge welcome back alone in the dark andy smiles 
 int cellblock five morning 
 the buzzer sounds the cells slam open cons step from their cells andy catches eye nods his thanks as the men 
 shuffle down to breakfast red glances into cell 
 pov dollying past 
 and sees rita in her new place of honor on wall 
 sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face 
 int cellblock five night 
 ernie is mopping the floor he glances back and sees warden 
 norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a dozen 
 guards still mopping ernie mutters to the nearest cell 
 ernie 
 heads up tossin cells 
 word travels fast from cell to cell cons scramble to tidy up and hide things norton enters nods to his men the guards pair off in all directions making their choices at random 
 guard 
 what contraband you hiding in there boy 
 cells are opened occupants displaced items scattered mattresses overturned whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor mostly harmless stuff 
 a guard pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress shoots a nasty look at the con responsible 
 norton 
 solitary a week make sure he takes his bible 
 con 
 too goddamn dark to read down there 
 norton 
 add another week for blasphemy 
 the man is taken away gaze goes up 
 norton 
 try the second tier 
 nd tier 
 norton arrives makes a thin show of picking a cell at random he motions at andy on his bunk reading his bible the door is unlocked norton enters trailed by his men andy rises 
 andy 
 good evening 
 norton gives a curt nod hadley and trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search norton keeps his eyes on andy looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink he takes the bible out of hand

 chapter vii 
 
 cravatte 
 it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the bishop of d was 
 after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes who had infested the gorges of ollioules one of his lieutenants cravatte took refuge in the mountains 
 he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the remnant of gaspard troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelonette 
 he was first seen at jauziers then at tuiles 
 he hid himself in the caverns of the and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and ubayette 
 he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy 
 his highway robberies laid waste the the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force 
 he was a bold wretch 
 in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived he was making his circuit to chastelar 
 the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps 
 cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose 
 therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort 
 you do not really mean that monseigneur exclaimed the mayor 
 i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour 
 set out 
 set out 
 alone 
 alone 
 monseigneur you will not do that 
 there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds 
 they own one goat out of every thirty that they tend 
 they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes 
 they need to be told of the good god now and then 
 what would they say to a bishop who was afraid what would they say if i did not go 
 but the brigands monseigneur 
 hold said the bishop i must think of that 
 you are right i may meet them 
 they too need to be told of the good god 
 but monseigneur there is a band of them 
 a flock of wolves 
 monsieur le maire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd 
 who knows the ways of providence 
 they will rob you monseigneur 
 i have nothing 
 they will kill you 
 an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers bah 
 to what purpose 
 oh mon dieu what if you should meet them 
 i should beg alms of them for my poor 
 do not go monseigneur 
 in the name of heaven 
 you are risking your life 
 monsieur le maire said the bishop is that really all i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls 
 they had to allow him to do as he pleased 
 he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide 
 his obstinacy was bruited about the and caused great consternation 
 he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire 
 he traversed the mountain on encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting 
 when the time of his departure approached he resolved to chant a te deum pontifically 
 he mentioned it to the cure 
 but what was to be done 
 there were no episcopal ornaments they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace 
 bah said the bishop 
 let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure 
 things will arrange themselves 
 they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly 
 while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who departed on the instant 
 the chest was opened it contained a cope of cloth of gold a mitre ornamented with diamonds an cross a magnificent the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu 
 did not i say that things would come right of themselves said the bishop 
 then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop 
 monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile the devil 
 the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god 
 when he returned to chastelar the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road 
 at the house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister 
 well was i in the right 
 the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full i set out bearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral 
 that evening before he went to bed he said again 
 let us never fear robbers nor murderers 
 those are dangers from without petty dangers 
 let us fear ourselves 
 prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers 
 the great dangers lie within ourselves what matters it what threatens our head or our purse 
 let us think only of that which threatens our soul 
 then turning to his sister 
 sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his that which his fellow does god permits 
 let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger is approaching us 
 let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account 
 however such incidents were rare in his life 
 we relate those of which we know but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment 
 one month of his year resembled one hour of his day 
 as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate 
 stolen they had already been elsewhere half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor 
 however we make no assertions on this point 
 only a rather obscure note was found among the papers which may bear some relation to this matter and which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital

 but two fifteen more when we reach alderaan 
 not the fifteen that worries me the first two kenobi explained have to sell your speeder 
 luke let his gaze rove over the landspeeder but the thrill it had once given himwas along with other things best not dwelt on 
 all right he assured kenobi listlessly i think need it again 
 from their vantage point in another booth solo and chewbacca watched as theimperials strode through the bar two of them gave the corellian a lingering growled once and the two soldiers hurried their pace somewhat 
 solo grinned sardonically turning to his partner chewie this charter couldsave our necks seventeen thousand he shook his head in amazement thosetwo must really be desperate i wonder what wanted for but i agreed noquestions paying enough for it get falcon checkitself out 
 going somewhere solo 
 the corellian identify the voice coming as it did through an electronictranslator but there was no problem recognizing the speaker or the gun it held stuckin side 
 the creature was roughly and bipedal but its head was something outof delirium by way of an upset stomach it had huge eyes bulbous on face a ridge of short spines crested the high skull while nostrils andmouth were contained in a snout 
 as a matter of fact solo replied slowly i was just on my way to see yourboss you can tell jabba got the money i owe him 
 what you said last the week prior to too late solo not going back to jabba with another one of your stories 
 but really got the money this time solo protested 
 fine take it now please 
 solo sat down slowly minions were apt to be cursed with nervoustrigger fingers the alien took the seat across from him the muzzle of the ugly littlepistol never straying from chest 
 i got it here with me tell jabba 
 too late i think jabba would rather have your my dead body solo said unamiably 
 the alien was not impressed if you insist will you come outside with must i finish it here 
 i think like another killing in here solo pointed out 
 something which might have been a laugh came from the hardly notice get up solo been looking forward to this for a longtime embarrassed me in front of jabba with your pious excuses for the lasttime 
 i think right 
 light and noise filled the little corner of the cantina and when it had faded allthat remained of the unctuous alien was a smoking slimy spot on the stone floor 
 solo brought his hand and the smoking weapon it held out from beneath the bemused stares from several of the patrons and clucking soundsfrom its more knowledgeable ones they had known the creature had committed itsfatal mistake in allowing solo the chance to get his hands under cover 
 take a lot more than the likes of you to finish me off jabba the hutalways did skimp when it came to hiring his hands 
 leaving the booth solo flipped the bartender a handful of coins as he andchewbacca moved off sorry for the mess i always was a rotten host 
 heavily armed troopers hurried down the narrow alleyway glowering from timeto time at the darkly clad beings who hawked exotic goods from dingy little in mos inner regions the walls were high and narrow turning thepassageway into tunnel 
 no one stared angrily back at them no one shouted imprecations or mouthedobscenities these armored figures moved with the authority of the empire theirsidearms boldly displayed and activated all around men andmechanicals were crouched in doorways among accumulations ofgarbage and filth they exchanged information and concluded transactions of dubiouslegality 
 a hot wind moaned down the alleyway and the troopers closed their precision and order masked a fear of such claustrophobic quarters 
 one paused to check a door only to discover it tightly locked and bolted human shambling nearby visited a harangue on the inwardly the soldier gave the crazy human a sour eye before moving ondown the alley to join up again with his fellow 
 as soon as they were well past the door slid open a crack and a metallic facepeered out below leg a squat barrel shape struggled for a view 
 i would rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you are orders i quite know what all the trouble is about but sure itmust be your fault 
 artoo responded with a near impossibility a sniggering beep 
 you watch your language the taller machine warned 
 the number of old landspeeders and other powered transports in the dusty lotwhich were still capable of motion could be counted on the fingers of one hand butthat was not the concern of luke and ben as they stood bargaining with the insectoid owner they were here not to buy but to sell 
 none of the passersby favored the hagglers with so much as a curious transactions which were no more pleas or threats to be exchanged asthough doling out vials of his own blood the owner finalized the sale by passing anumber of small metal shapes to luke luke and the insectoid traded formal and then they parted each convinced he had gotten the better of the deal 
 he says the best he can do since the xp came out they just indemand anymore luke sighed 
 look so discouraged kenobi chided him what obtained willbe sufficient enough to cover the rest 
 leaving the main street they turned down an alleyway and walked past a smallrobot herding along a clutch of creatures resembling attenuated anteaters as theyrounded the corner luke strained for a forlorn glimpse of the old link with his former life then there was no more time for looking back 
 something short and dark that might have been human underneath all itswrappings stepped out of the shadows as they moved away from the corner itcontinued staring after them as they disappeared down a bend in the walkway 
 the entrance to the small spacecraft was completelyringed by half a dozen men and aliens of which the former were by half the mostgrotesque a great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skullsurveyed the semicircle of armed assassins with satisfaction moving forward fromthe center of the crescent he shouted toward the ship 
 come on out solo got you surrounded 
 if so facing the wrong way came a calm voice 
 jabba the hut itself a remarkable sight his lackeys see han solo and chewbacca standing behind them 
 you see been waiting for you jabba 
 i expected you would be the hut admitted at once pleased and alarmed by thefact that neither solo nor the big wookie appeared to be armed 
 not the type to run solo said 
 run run from what jabba countered the absence of visible weaponsbothered jabba more than he cared to admit to himself there was somethingpeculiar here and it would be better to make no hasty moves until he discovered whatwas amiss 
 han my boy there are times when you disappoint me i merely wish to knowwhy you paid me as you should have long ago and why did you have tofry poor greedo like that after all you and i have been through together 
 solo grinned tightly shove it jabba there enough sentiment in yourbody to warm an orphaned bacterium as for greedo you sent him to kill me 
 why han jabba protested in surprise why would i do that the bestsmuggler in the business too valuable to fry greedo was only relaying mynatural concern at your delays he going to kill you 
 i think he thought he was next time send one of those hired twerps got something to say come see me yourself 
 jabba shook his head and his jowls fleshy echoes of his mocksorrow han only you understandi just make an would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped his shipment at thefirst sign of an imperial warship and then simply showed empty pockets when idemanded recompense not good business i can be generous and not to the point of bankruptcy 
 you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba did you think i dumped thatspice because i got tired of its smell i wanted to deliver it as much as you wantedto receive it i had no choice again the sardonic smile as you say toovaluable to fry but got a charter now and i can pay you back plus a little just need some more time i can give you a thousand on account the rest in threeweeks 
 the gross form seemed to consider then directed his next words not to solo butto his hirelings put your blasters away his gaze and a predatory smile turned tothe wary corellian 
 han my boy only doing this because the best and need youagain sometime so out of the greatness of my soul and a forgiving foran extra say twenty give you a little more time the voice nearlycracked with restraint but this is the last time if you disappoint me again if youtrample my generosity in your mocking laughter put a price on your head so largeyou be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your life because onevery one your name and face will be known to men gladly cut your guts outfor of what promise them 
 glad we both have my best interests at heart replied solo pleasantly as heand chewbacca started past the staring eyes of the hired guns pay you but not because you threaten me pay you pleasure 
 starting to search the spaceport central the commander to alternately run a couple of steps and then walk to keep pace with the longstrides of darth vader the dark lord was deep in thought as he strode down one ofthe battle main corridors trailed by several aides 
 the reports are just starting to come in the commander went on only amatter of time before we have those droids 
 send in more men if you have to never mind the protests of the must have those droids her hope of that data being used againstus that is the pillar of her resistance to the mind probes 
 i understand lord vader until then we must waste our time with foolish plan to break her 
 docking bay luke told kenobi and the robots who hadrejoined them and chewbacca he seems excited about something 
 indeed the big wookie was waving over the heads of the crowd and jabberingloudly in their direction speeding their pace none of the foursome noticed thesmall thing that had followed them from the transporter lot 
 the creature moved into the doorway and pulled a tiny transmitter from a pouchconcealed by its multifold robes the transmitter looked far too new and modern tobe in the grasp of so decrepit a specimen yet its manipulator was speaking into it withsteady assurance 
 docking bay luke noted was no different in appearance from a hostof other grandiosely named docking bays scattered throughout mos eisley itconsisted mostly of an entrance rampway and an enormous pit gouged from the rockysoil this served as clearance radii for the effects of the simple antigrav drive whichboosted all spacecraft clear of the gravitational field of the planet 
 the mathematics of spacedrive were simple enough even to luke antigravcould operate only when there was a sufficient gravity well to push thatof a supralight travel could only take place when a ship was clear ofthat same gravity hence the necessity for the system on any extrasystemcraft 
 the pit which formed docking bay was as shabbily cut and as the majority of mos eisley its sloping sides were crumbling in placesinstead of being smoothly fashioned as they were on more populous worlds lukefelt it formed the perfect setting for the spacecraft chewbacca was leading themtoward 
 that battered ellipsoid which could only loosely be labeled a ship appeared tohave been pieced together out of old hull fragments and components discarded asunusable by other craft the wonder of it luke mused was that the thing actuallyheld its shape trying to picture this vehicle as spaceworthy would have caused himto collapse in the situation not so serious but to think of traveling toalderaan in this pathetic 
 what a piece of junk he finally murmured unable to hide his feelings anylonger they were walking up the rampway toward the open port this possibly make it into hyperspace 
 kenobi comment but merely gestured toward the port where a figure wascoming to meet them 
 either solo had supernaturally acute hearing or else he was used to the reactionthe sight of the millennium falcon produced in prospective passengers she maynot look like much he confessed as he approached them but all go a few unique modifications to her myself in addition to piloting i like totinker make point five factors beyond lightspeed 
 luke scratched his head as he tried to reassess the craft in view of its either the corellian was the biggest liar this side of the galactic center orthere was more to this vessel than met the eye luke thought back once more to admonition never to trust surface impressions and decided to reserve judgmenton the ship and its pilot until after he had watched them in operation 
 chewbacca had lingered behind at the entrance now he rushedup the ramp a hairy whirlwind and blabbered excitedly at solo the pilot regardedhim coolly nodding from time to time then barked a brief reply the wookiecharged into the ship pausing only to urge everyone to follow 
 we seem to be a bit rushed solo explained cryptically so if hurryaboard be off 
 luke was about to venture some questions but kenobi was already proddinghim up the ramp the droids followed 
 inside luke was slightly startled to see the bulky chewbacca squirm and fighthis way into a chair which despite modifications was still byhis massive form the wookie flipped several tiny switches with digits seeminglytoo big for the task those great paws drifted with surprising grace over the controls 
 a deep throbbing started somewhere within the ship as the engines wereactivated luke and ben began strapping themselves into the vacant seats in themain passageway 
 outside the entrance a long leathery snout protruded from darkfolds of cloth and somewhere in the depths to either side of that imposing stared intently they turned along with the rest of the head as a squad of eightimperial troops rushed up perhaps not surprisingly they headed straight for theenigmatic figure who whispered something to the lead trooper and gestured to thedocking bay 
 the information must have been provocative activating their weapons andraising them to firing position the troops charged en masse down the 
 a glint of light on moving metal caught eyes as the unwelcome outlinesof the first troops showed themselves solo thought it unlikely they would pause toengage in casual conversation his suspicion was confirmed before he could openhis mouth to protest their intrusion as several dropped to their knees and opened fireon him solo ducked back inside turning to yell forward 
 shields quick get us out of here 
 a throaty roar of acknowledgment came back to him 
 drawing his own pistol solo managed to snap off a couple of bursts from thecomparative safety of the hatchway seeing that their quarry was neither helplessnor comatose the exposed troops dove for cover 
 the low throbbing rose to a whine then to a deafening howl as hand camedown on the button immediately the overhead slammedshut 
 as the retreating troops raced out of the entrance the ground wastrembling steadily they ran smack into a second squad which had just arrived inresponse to the rapidly spreading emergency call one of the soldiers gesticulatingwildly tried to explain to the newly arrived ranking officer what had happened backin the bay 
 as soon as the panting trooper had finished the officer whipped out a compactcommunicator and shouted into it flight trying to escape sendeverything got after this ship 
 all across mos eisley alarms began to sound spreading out from docking in concentric circles of concern 
 several soldiers scouring one alleyway reacted to the citywide alarm at the sametime as they saw the small freighter lift gracefully into the clear blue sky above moseisley it shrank to a pinpoint before any of them thought to bring a weapon to bear 
 luke and ben were already undoing their acceleration straps as solo walked pastthem moving toward the cockpit with the easy stride of the experiencedspacer once forward he fell rather than sat in the seat and immediatelybegan checking readouts and gauges in the seat next to him chewbacca wasgrowling and grunting like a poorly tuned speeder engine he turned from studyinghis own instruments long enough to jab a massive finger at the tracking screen 
 solo gave it a quick glance then turned irritably to his own panel i know iknowlooks like two maybe three destroyers somebody certainly dislikes ourpassengers sure picked ourselves a hot one this time try to hold them offsomehow until i can finish the programming for the supralight jump angle thedeflectors for maximum shielding 
 with those instructions he ceased conversing with the huge wookie as his handsflew over the terminals solo did not even turned around when asmall cylindrical shape appeared in the doorway behind him artoo detoo beeped afew remarks then scurried away 
 rear scanners showed the baleful lemon eye of tatooine shrinking rapidlybehind them it rapid enough to eliminate the three points of light thatindicated the presence of the pursuing imperial warships 
 although solo had ignored artoo he turned to acknowledge the entrance of hishuman passengers got two more coming in from different angles he toldthem scrutinizing the remorseless instrumentation going to try box upbefore we can jump five shipswhat did you two do to attract that kind ofcompany 
 you outrun them luke asked sarcastically ignoring the questionthe question i thought you said this thing was fast 
 watch your mouth kid or find yourself floating home toomany of em for one thing but be safe enough once made the jumpinto hyperspace he grinned knowingly nobody track another shipaccurately at supralight speeds plus i know a few tricks that ought to lose anypersistent i wish known you boys were so popular 
 why luke said challengingly would you have refused to take us 
 not necessarily the corellian replied refusing to be baited but i boosted your fare 
 luke had a retort poised on his lips it was wiped out as he threw up his armsto ward off a brilliant red flash which gave black space outside the viewport thetemporary aspect of the surface of a sun kenobi solo and even chewbacca didlikewise since the proximity of the explosion nearly overrode the phototropicshielding 
 where the situation gets interesting solo muttered 
 how long before you can make the jump kenobi inquired easily apparentlyunconcerned that at any second they all might cease to exist 
 still within the gravitational influence of tatooine came the coolresponse it will be a few minutes yet before the navigation computer cancompensate and effect an accurate jump i could override its decision but thehyperdrive would likely shred itself that would give me a nice hold full of scrapmetal in addition to you four 
 a few minutes luke blurted staring at the screens at the rate 
 traveling through hyperspace like dusting crops boy ever triedcalculating a hyperspace jump luke had to shake his head no mean nice if we rushed it and passed right through a star or some other friendly spatialphenom like a black hole that would end our trip real quick 
 fresh explosions continued to flare close by despite best efforts atevasion on console a red warning light began to flash for attention 
 that luke wondered nervously 
 losing a deflector shield solo informed him with the air of a man aboutto have a tooth pulled better strap yourselves back in almost ready tomake the jump it could get bad if we take a at the wrong moment 
 back in the main hold area threepio was already locked tightly into his seat bymetal arms stronger than any acceleration straps artoo swayed back and forthunder the concussion produced by increasingly powerful energy bursts against deflectors 
 was this trip really necessary the tall robot muttered in desperation how much i hate space travel he broke off as luke and ben appearedand began strapping themselves back into their chairs 
 oddly luke was thinking of a dog he had once owned when an immenselypowerful something wrenched at the hull with the strength of a fallen angel 
 admiral motti entered the quiet conference room his face streaked by the linearlights lining the walls his gaze went to the spot where governor tarkin stoodbefore the curved viewscreen and he bowed slightly despite the evidence of thesmall green gem of a world entered in the screen he formally announced we haveentered the alderaan system we await your order 
 the door signaled and tarkin made a falsely gentle gesture to the a moment yet motti 
 the door slid aside and leia organa entered flanked by two armed by darth vader 
 i am tarkin began 
 i know who you are she spat governor tarkin i should have expected tofind you holding leash i thought i recognized your unique stench when iwas first brought on board 
 charming to the last tarkin declared in a fashion which suggested he wasanything but charmed you know how hard i found it to sign the order foryour termination his expression changed to one of mock sorrow of you cooperated in our investigation things might be otherwise lord vader hasinformed me that your resistance to our traditional methods of inquiry 
 torture you mean she countered a trifle shakily 
 let us not bandy semantics tarkin smiled 
 surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility for issuing the orderon yourself 
 tarkin sighed reluctantly i am a dedicated man and the pleasures i reservedfor myself are few one of them is that before your execution i should like you to bemy guest at a small ceremony it will certify this battle operational statuswhile at the same time ushering in a new era of imperial technical supremacy thisstation is the final link in the imperial chain which will bind the millionsystems of the galactic empire together once and for all your petty alliance will nolonger be of any concern to us after demonstration no one will dare toopposite imperial decree not even the senate 
 organa looked at him with contempt force will not keep the empire has never kept anything together for very long the more you tighten yourgrip the more systems will slip through your fingers a foolish foolish men often choke to death on their own delusions 
 tarkin smiled a smile his face a parchment it will beinteresting to see what manner of passing lord vader has in mind for you i amcertain it will be worthy of of him 
 but before you leave us we must demonstrate the power of this station onceand for all in a conclusive fashion in a way you have determined the choice ofsubject for this demonstration since you have proven reluctant to supply us withthe location of the rebel stronghold i have deemed it appropriate to select as analternate subject your home planet of alderaan 
 no you alderaan is a peaceful world with no standing 
 eyes gleamed you would prefer another target a military agreeable grow tired of such games for the last time where is themain rebel base 
 a voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had approached withinantigrav range of six planetary diameters that wasenough to accomplish what all of infernal devices had failed to 
 dantooine she whispered staring at the deck all pretense at defiance gonenow on dantooine 
 tarkin let out a slow sigh of satisfaction then turned to the black figure you see lord vader she can be reasonable one needs only frame thequestion properly to elicit the desired response he directed his attention to theother officers after concluding our little test here we shall make haste to move onto dantooine you may proceed with the operation gentlemen 
 it took several seconds for words so casually uttered to organa finally gasped 
 dantooine tarkin explained examining his fingers is too far from thecenters of imperial population to serve as the subject of an effective will understand that for reports of our power to spread rapidly through theempire we require an obstreperous world more centrally located have no we will deal with your rebel friends on dantooine as soon as possible 
 but you said organa started to protest 
 the only words which have meaning are the last ones spoken tarkin declaredcuttingly we will proceed with destruction of alderaan as planned then youwill enjoy watching with us as we obliterate the dantooine center of this stupid andfutile rebellion 
 he gestured to the two soldiers flanking her escort her to the principalobservation level and he smiled make certain she is provided with an unobstructedview

 a new hope 
 vii 
 
 luke and ben were securing artoo detoo in the back of the speeder while threepiokept a lookout for any additional troops 
 if ship is as fast as his boasting we should be all right the old manobserved with satisfaction 
 but two fifteen more when we reach alderaan 
 not the fifteen that worries me the first two kenobi explained have to sell your speeder 
 luke let his gaze rove over the landspeeder but the thrill it had once given himwas along with other things best not dwelt on

 a glint of light on moving metal caught eyes as the unwelcome outlinesof the first troops showed themselves solo thought it unlikely they would pause toengage in casual conversation his suspicion was confirmed before he could openhis mouth to protest their intrusion as several dropped to their knees and opened fireon him solo ducked back inside turning to yell forward 
 shields quick get us out of here 
 a throaty roar of acknowledgment came back to him 
 drawing his own pistol solo managed to snap off a couple of bursts from thecomparative safety of the hatchway seeing that their quarry was neither helplessnor comatose the exposed troops dove for cover 
 the low throbbing rose to a whine then to a deafening howl as hand camedown on the button immediately the overhead slammedshut 
 as the retreating troops raced out of the entrance the ground wastrembling steadily they ran smack into a second squad which had just arrived inresponse to the rapidly spreading emergency call one of the soldiers gesticulatingwildly tried to explain to the newly arrived ranking officer what had happened backin the bay 
 as soon as the panting trooper had finished the officer whipped out a compactcommunicator and shouted into it flight trying to escape sendeverything got after this ship 
 all across mos eisley alarms began to sound spreading out from docking in concentric circles of concern 
 several soldiers scouring one alleyway reacted to the citywide alarm at the sametime as they saw the small freighter lift gracefully into the clear blue sky above moseisley it shrank to a pinpoint before any of them thought to bring a weapon to bear 
 luke and ben were already undoing their acceleration straps as solo walked pastthem moving toward the cockpit with the easy stride of the experiencedspacer once forward he fell rather than sat in the seat and immediatelybegan checking readouts and gauges in the seat next to him chewbacca wasgrowling and grunting like a poorly tuned speeder engine he turned from studyinghis own instruments long enough to jab a massive finger at the tracking screen 
 solo gave it a quick glance then turned irritably to his own panel i know iknowlooks like two maybe three destroyers somebody certainly dislikes ourpassengers sure picked ourselves a hot one this time try to hold them offsomehow until i can finish the programming for the supralight jump angle thedeflectors for maximum shielding 
 with those instructions he ceased conversing with the huge wookie as his handsflew over the terminals solo did not even turned around when asmall cylindrical shape appeared in the doorway behind him artoo detoo beeped afew remarks then scurried away 
 rear scanners showed the baleful lemon eye of tatooine shrinking rapidlybehind them it rapid enough to eliminate the three points of light thatindicated the presence of the pursuing imperial warships 
 although solo had ignored artoo he turned to acknowledge the entrance of hishuman passengers got two more coming in from different angles he toldthem scrutinizing the remorseless instrumentation going to try box upbefore we can jump five shipswhat did you two do to attract that kind ofcompany 
 you outrun them luke asked sarcastically ignoring the questionthe question i thought you said this thing was fast 
 watch your mouth kid or find yourself floating home toomany of em for one thing but be safe enough once made the jumpinto hyperspace he grinned knowingly nobody track another shipaccurately at supralight speeds plus i know a few tricks that ought to lose anypersistent i wish known you boys were so popular 
 why luke said challengingly would you have refused to take us 
 not necessarily the corellian replied refusing to be baited but i boosted your fare 
 luke had a retort poised on his lips it was wiped out as he threw up his armsto ward off a brilliant red flash which gave black space outside the viewport thetemporary aspect of the surface of a sun kenobi solo and even chewbacca didlikewise since the proximity of the explosion nearly overrode the phototropicshielding 
 where the situation gets interesting solo muttered 
 how long before you can make the jump kenobi inquired easily apparentlyunconcerned that at any second they all might cease to exist 
 still within the gravitational influence of tatooine came the coolresponse it will be a few minutes yet before the navigation computer cancompensate and effect an accurate jump i could override its decision but thehyperdrive would likely shred itself that would give me a nice hold full of scrapmetal in addition to you four 
 a few minutes luke blurted staring at the screens at the rate 
 traveling through hyperspace like dusting crops boy ever triedcalculating a hyperspace jump luke had to shake his head no mean nice if we rushed it and passed right through a star or some other friendly spatialphenom like a black hole that would end our trip real quick 
 fresh explosions continued to flare close by despite best efforts atevasion on console a red warning light began to flash for attention 
 that luke wondered nervously 
 losing a deflector shield solo informed him with the air of a man aboutto have a tooth pulled better strap yourselves back in almost ready tomake the jump it could get bad if we take a at the wrong moment 
 back in the main hold area threepio was already locked tightly into his seat bymetal arms stronger than any acceleration straps artoo swayed back and forthunder the concussion produced by increasingly powerful energy bursts against deflectors 
 was this trip really necessary the tall robot muttered in desperation how much i hate space travel he broke off as luke and ben appearedand began strapping themselves back into their chairs 
 oddly luke was thinking of a dog he had once owned when an immenselypowerful something wrenched at the hull with the strength of a fallen angel 
 admiral motti entered the quiet conference room his face streaked by the linearlights lining the walls his gaze went to the spot where governor tarkin stoodbefore the curved viewscreen and he bowed slightly despite the evidence of thesmall green gem of a world entered in the screen he formally announced we haveentered the alderaan system we await your order 
 the door signaled and tarkin made a falsely gentle gesture to the a moment yet motti 
 the door slid aside and leia organa entered flanked by two armed by darth vader 
 i am tarkin began 
 i know who you are she spat governor tarkin i should have expected tofind you holding leash i thought i recognized your unique stench when iwas first brought on board 
 charming to the last tarkin declared in a fashion which suggested he wasanything but charmed you know how hard i found it to sign the order foryour termination his expression changed to one of mock sorrow of you cooperated in our investigation things might be otherwise lord vader hasinformed me that your resistance to our traditional methods of inquiry 
 torture you mean she countered a trifle shakily 
 let us not bandy semantics tarkin smiled 
 surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility for issuing the orderon yourself 
 tarkin sighed reluctantly i am a dedicated man and the pleasures i reservedfor myself are few one of them is that before your execution i should like you to bemy guest at a small ceremony it will certify this battle operational statuswhile at the same time ushering in a new era of imperial technical supremacy thisstation is the final link in the imperial chain which will bind the millionsystems of the galactic empire together once and for all your petty alliance will nolonger be of any concern to us after demonstration no one will dare toopposite imperial decree not even the senate 
 organa looked at him with contempt force will not keep the empire has never kept anything together for very long the more you tighten yourgrip the more systems will slip through your fingers a foolish foolish men often choke to death on their own delusions 
 tarkin smiled a smile his face a parchment it will beinteresting to see what manner of passing lord vader has in mind for you i amcertain it will be worthy of of him 
 but before you leave us we must demonstrate the power of this station onceand for all in a conclusive fashion in a way you have determined the choice ofsubject for this demonstration since you have proven reluctant to supply us withthe location of the rebel stronghold i have deemed it appropriate to select as analternate subject your home planet of alderaan 
 no you alderaan is a peaceful world with no standing 
 eyes gleamed you would prefer another target a military agreeable grow tired of such games for the last time where is themain rebel base 
 a voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had approached withinantigrav range of six planetary diameters that wasenough to accomplish what all of infernal devices had failed to 
 dantooine she whispered staring at the deck all pretense at defiance gonenow on dantooine 
 tarkin let out a slow sigh of satisfaction then turned to the black figure you see lord vader she can be reasonable one needs only frame thequestion properly to elicit the desired response he directed his attention to theother officers after concluding our little test here we shall make haste to move onto dantooine you may proceed with the operation gentlemen 
 it took several seconds for words so casually uttered to organa finally gasped 
 dantooine tarkin explained examining his fingers is too far from thecenters of imperial population to serve as the subject of an effective will understand that for reports of our power to spread rapidly through theempire we require an obstreperous world more centrally located have no we will deal with your rebel friends on dantooine as soon as possible 
 but you said organa started to protest 
 the only words which have meaning are the last ones spoken tarkin declaredcuttingly we will proceed with destruction of alderaan as planned then youwill enjoy watching with us as we obliterate the dantooine center of this stupid andfutile rebellion 
 he gestured to the two soldiers flanking her escort her to the principalobservation level and he smiled make certain she is provided with an unobstructedview

 the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand 
 let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door 
 they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out 
 never never marry my dear fellow my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but the good and he waved his arm 
 pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement 
 my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a honor is safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you 
 as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna easy chairs and with eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation 
 you understand why i say this he continued but it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew and at anna they listen to me and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right selfish vain stupid trivial in everything what women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but nothing nothing nothing no marry my dear fellow marry concluded prince andrew 
 it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you 
 he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future 
 how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength 
 even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly 
 my part is played out said prince andrew the use of talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts 
 that smile was immediately reflected on face 
 but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously 
 prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority 
 i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes all right choose what you will all the same be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it 
 what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women 
 i understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut a different matter but the kuragins set of women women and wine i understand 
 pierre was staying at prince vasili and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince sister 
 do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i decide or think properly about anything head aches and one spends all money he asked me for tonight but i go 
 you give me your word of honor not to go 
 on my honor

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers

 chapter eight 
 
 girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity 
 never mind little girls ask questions returned jo sharply 
 now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i got anything to do and am so lonely 
 i dear because you invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you go amy so be a baby and whine about it 
 you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in you going with him 
 yes we are now do be still and stop bothering 
 amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket 
 i know i know going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time 
 just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time 
 i like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me been sick with this cold so long and shut up dying for some fun do meg be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could 
 suppose we take her i believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg 
 if she goes i and if i laurie like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think hate to poke herself where she wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself 
 her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie anything to do with it 
 you sit with us for our seats are reserved and you sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or get another seat for you and that proper when you asked you stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry 
 sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone be sorry for this jo march see if you 
 fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door 
 they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it 
 when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs 
 there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book 
 meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute 
 amy got it 
 no i 
 you know where it is then 
 no i 
 a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy 
 it i got it know where it is now and care 
 you know something about it and better tell at once or make you and jo gave her a slight shake 
 scold as much as you like never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn 
 why not 
 i burned it up 
 what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously 
 yes i did i told you make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so 
 amy got no farther for hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger 
 you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and never forgive you as long as i live 
 meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone 
 the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them 
 when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all courage to say meekly 
 please forgive me jo very very sorry 
 i never shall forgive you was stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely 
 no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune 
 as jo received her kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow 
 jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she deserve to be forgiven 
 with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night 
 amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet even try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went 
 amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation 
 there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me 
 say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them say anything till jo has got with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and sure be friends again with all her heart 
 try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill 
 it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap 
 go on to the first bend and see if all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his coat and cap 
 jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back 
 keep near the shore it safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear 
 no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself 
 laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and voice cried out 
 bring a rail quick quick 
 how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt 
 now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before 
 shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands 
 are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice 
 quite safe dear she is not hurt and even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully 
 laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair 
 watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder 
 you know you guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me 
 i will my child i will cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it 
 yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise 
 been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so 
 the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen 
 mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before 
 yes learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up disheveled hair 
 how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what about and the more i say the worse i get till a pleasure to hurt feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear 
 my good mother used to help me 
 as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss 
 but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything 
 poor mother what helped you then 
 your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy 
 oh mother if ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched 
 i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today 
 i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly 
 yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look 
 jo saw that her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i mean to be rude but so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here 
 mu jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them 
 i thought grieved you 
 no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him 
 yet you told him to go mother and cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering 
 i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but my become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother 
 only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of and and led by her hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother 
 amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault l jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before 
 i let the sun go down on my anger i forgive her and today if it been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow 
 as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss

 chapter eight 
 
 girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity 
 never mind little girls ask questions returned jo sharply 
 now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i got anything to do and am so lonely 
 i dear because you invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you go amy so be a baby and whine about it 
 you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in you going with him 
 yes we are now do be still and stop bothering 
 amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket 
 i know i know going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time 
 just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time 
 i like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me been sick with this cold so long and shut up dying for some fun do meg be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could 
 suppose we take her i believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg 
 if she goes i and if i laurie like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think hate to poke herself where she wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself 
 her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie anything to do with it 
 you sit with us for our seats are reserved and you sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or get another seat for you and that proper when you asked you stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry 
 sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone be sorry for this jo march see if you 
 fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door 
 they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it 
 when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs 
 there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book 
 meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute 
 amy got it 
 no i 
 you know where it is then 
 no i 
 a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy 
 it i got it know where it is now and care 
 you know something about it and better tell at once or make you and jo gave her a slight shake 
 scold as much as you like never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn 
 why not 
 i burned it up 
 what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously 
 yes i did i told you make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so 
 amy got no farther for hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger 
 you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and never forgive you as long as i live 
 meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone 
 the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them 
 when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all courage to say meekly 
 please forgive me jo very very sorry 
 i never shall forgive you was stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely 
 no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune 
 as jo received her kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow 
 jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she deserve to be forgiven 
 with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night 
 amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet even try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went 
 amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation 
 there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me 
 say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them say anything till jo has got with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and sure be friends again with all her heart 
 try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill 
 it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap 
 go on to the first bend and see if all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his coat and cap 
 jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back 
 keep near the shore it safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear 
 no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself 
 laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and voice cried out 
 bring a rail quick quick 
 how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt 
 now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before 
 shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands 
 are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice 
 quite safe dear she is not hurt and even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully 
 laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair 
 watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder 
 you know you guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me 
 i will my child i will cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it 
 yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise 
 been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so 
 the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen 
 mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before 
 yes learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up disheveled hair 
 how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what about and the more i say the worse i get till a pleasure to hurt feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear 
 my good mother used to help me 
 as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss 
 but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything 
 poor mother what helped you then 
 your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy 
 oh mother if ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched 
 i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today 
 i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly 
 yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look 
 jo saw that her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i mean to be rude but so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here 
 mu jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them 
 i thought grieved you 
 no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him 
 yet you told him to go mother and cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering 
 i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but my become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother 
 only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of and and led by her hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother 
 amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault l jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before 
 i let the sun go down on my anger i forgive her and today if it been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow 
 as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss

 evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
 books a blast of thunder and lightning scares her she drops 
 half the books then a hand grabs her she jumps again and 
 drops the rest of the books breathing hard 
 
 we got problems 
 and when a barrage of hail and fire slams into the 
 courtyard and evelyn jump back a water fountain 
 bursts into steam a wooden trellis catches fire 
 and evelyn run under the eaves as soldiers servants and 
 camels run in every direction trying to avoid the maelstrom

 the creature are you sure 
 gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the

 is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them 
 and evelyn race up the stairs

 and evelyn race into the room past the servant who 
 is running out screaming they skid to a stop as they spot 
 burns or left of him lying dead on the floor his 
 body is shrivelled to half size drained of all organs 
 and liquids and evelyn are shocked then they hear 
 a loud moan and notice imhotep standing on the far side of 
 the room draws his gun 
 imhotep is regenerating a thick skin forms over powerful new 
 musculature his tendons ripple his bones bulge and reform 
 his mouth opens to an inhuman size as he moans and crys out 
 in severe pain and then over and he looks like an 
 incredibly muscular vision from hell the 
 terminator mummy and evelyn are stunned 
 
 we are in serious trouble 
 imhotep starts to move towards them staring at evelyn 
 
 back off creep 
 imhotep keeps coming opens fire blasting imhotep

 jonathan henderson and daniels run into the room 
 all stunned at the sight of imhotep 
 steps forward throws a right hook punches imhotep 
 in the face his fist goes through imhotepis skull and gets 
 stuck deep inside his head stares at it shocked 
 then quickly yanks his fist back out the area of 
 face that came into contact with fist quickly 
 degenerates and decays right down to the bone as if 
 hand instantly infected it 
 imhotep angrily turns grabs and with no effort 
 throws him across the room and into jonathan and the others 
 knocking them down imhotep looks at his hand the one that 
 just grabbed it starts to shrivel and decay 
 he quickly turns to evelyn evelyn backs away into a wall 
 terrorized imhotep steps up to her 
 imhotep subtitled 
 you saved me from the undead 
 for this i shall make you immortal 
 he leans in about to kiss her with his decayed face 
 and when a white cat jumps onto the piano hissing 
 imhotep shrieks the balcony doors blow open imhotep spins 
 into a blast of wind and sand and swirls out the doors gone 
 
 evelyn jonathan and daniels stand transfixed 
 henderson kneels next to burns shriveled body horrified

 int room 
 across the room a dark figure stares out the tall 
 windows veiled with decaying lace he turns and his 
 smile lights up the room 
 morpheus 
 at last 
 he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible 
 behind circular mirrored glasses 
 he strides to neo and they shake hands 
 morpheus 
 welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus 
 neo 
 an honor 
 morpheus 
 please come sit 
 he nods to trinity 
 morpheus 
 thank you trinity 
 she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an 
 adjacent room 
 they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy 
 leather chairs 
 morpheus 
 i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling 
 down the rabbit hole 
 neo 
 you could say that 
 morpheus 
 i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts 
 what he sees because he is expecting to wake up 
 a smile curls the corner of his lips 
 morpheus 
 ironically this is not far from the truth but getting ahead 
 of myself can you tell me neo why are you here 
 neo 
 morpheus a legend most hackers would die to meet 
 you 
 morpheus 
 yes thank you but i think we both know more to it than 
 that do you believe in fate neo 
 neo 
 no 
 morpheus 
 why not 
 neo 
 because i like the idea that not in control of my life 
 morpheus 
 i know exactly what you mean 
 again that smile that could cut glass 
 morpheus 
 let me tell you why you are here you are here because you have the gift 
 neo 
 what gift 
 morpheus 
 watched you neo you do not use a computer like a tool you 
 use it like it was part of yourself what you can do inside 
 a computer is not normal i know seen it what you do is 
 magic 
 neo shrugs 
 neo 
 not magic 
 morpheus 
 but it is neo it is how else would you describe what has been 
 happening to you 
 he leans forward 
 morpheus 
 we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and 
 logical have you ever wondered why 
 neo shakes his head 
 morpheus 
 as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible 
 which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a 
 mind like yours can be very difficult 
 neo 
 free from what 
 morpheus 
 from the matrix 
 neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself 
 morpheus 
 do you want to know what it is neo 
 neo swallows and nods his head 
 morpheus 
 that feeling you have had all your life that feeling that 
 something was wrong with the world you know what it is 
 but there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad 
 driving you to me but what is it 
 the leather creaks as he leans back 
 morpheus 
 the matrix is everywhere all around us here even in this room 
 you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it 
 when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is 
 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from 
 the truth 
 neo 
 what truth 
 morpheus 
 that you are a slave neo that you like everyone else was born 
 into bondage 
 kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch a 
 prison for your mind 
 outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass 
 morpheus 
 unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to 
 see it for yourself 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 hold out your hands 
 in right hand morpheus drops a red pill 
 morpheus 
 this is your last chance after this there is no going back 
 in his left a blue pill 
 morpheus 
 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed 
 and you believe whatever you want to believe 
 the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses 
 morpheus 
 you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the goes 
 neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the 
 moisture growing in his palms 
 morpheus 
 remember that all i am offering is the truth nothing more 
 neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill the 
 cheshire smile returns 
 morpheus 
 follow me 
 he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with 
 equipment glowing and electric green 
 from the racks of monitors 
 trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter 
 cypher 
 shit 
 trinity 
 i knew he would 
 cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone 
 away from neo 
 cypher 
 morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake 
 rushing him old afraid he might pop 
 morpheus 
 i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life 
 apoc are we 
 neo recognizes the large man from the el train 
 apoc 
 almost 
 he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex 
 system of monitors modules and drives 
 neo 
 apoc you wrote the four horsemen virus 
 apoc 
 right 
 morpheus 
 neo time is always against us will you take a seat there 
 in the center of the room sits a chair near the chair 
 is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked 
 morpheus 
 i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality 
 neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode 
 disks to his head arns and the back of his neck 
 neo 
 a little 
 morpheus 
 tell me about it 
 neo 
 essentially a hardware system that uses an apparatus 
 headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a 
 computer program 
 morpheus 
 if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all 
 of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world 
 neo 
 you might not no 
 morpheus 
 no you 
 neo whispers to trinity 
 neo 
 you did all this 
 she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears 
 they are wired to an old hotel phone 
 morpheus 
 the pill you took is part of a trace program going to make 
 things feel a bit strange 
 distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding 
 on a keyboard sweat beads his face his eyes blink and 
 twitch when he notices the mirror 
 he stares as it begins to heal itself a 
 webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the 
 mirror were becoming liquid 
 neo 
 shit 
 cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent 
 data trinity monitors electric vital signs 
 neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers 
 disappear beneath the rippling surface 
 quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror 
 stretches in long rubbery strands like 
 stuck to his fingertips 
 neo 
 what is this mescaline 
 morpheus 
 just relax neo 
 the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away 
 until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break 
 with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes 
 of mercury fall hit the ground and 
 fade 
 he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored 
 icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running 
 like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms 
 where he sees his face reflected 
 neo 
 
 trinity 
 going into replication 
 morpheus 
 apoc 
 apoc 
 still nothing 
 morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number 
 morpheus 
 tank going to need the signal soon stay calm neo 
 the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up 
 his arns like hundreds of insects 
 neo 
 cold 
 the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic 
 tipping his head as though he were sinking into the 
 mirror trying to keep his mouth up 
 neo 
 all over me 
 morpheus is right next to him with the phone 
 trinity 
 i got a fibrillation 
 cypher 
 i knew it i knew it 
 morpheus 
 shit apoc 
 streams of mercury run from nose 
 apoc 
 targeting almost there 
 an alarm on monitor erupts 
 trinity 
 going into arrest 
 cypher 
 gonna pop 
 apoc 
 lock i got him 
 morpheus 
 now tank now 
 his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a 
 electric scream erupts in the headphones 
 it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to 
 another computer 
 body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were 
 pulled into the holes of the phone 
 sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness
