 when the ceremony of plighting troth was over the sacristan spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house neither levin nor kitty were capable of recollecting it as they took the few steps toward it they did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed some maintaining he had stepped on it first and others that both had stepped on it together 
 after the customary questions whether they desired to enter upon matrimony and whether they were pledged to anyone else and their answers which sounded strange to themselves a new ceremony began kitty listened to the words of the prayer trying to make out their meaning but she could not the feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on and deprived her of all power of attention 
 they prayed endow them with continence and fruitfulness and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters they alluded to creation of a wife from rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh and that this is a great mystery they prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them like isaac and rebecca joseph moses and zipporah and that they might look upon their children all splendid thought kitty catching the words all just as it should be and a smile of happiness unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her beamed on her radiant face 
 put it on completely voices were heard urging when after the priest had put on their wedding crowns and shcherbatsky his hand shaking in its glove was holding the crown high above her head 
 put it on she whispered smiling 
 levin looked round at her and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face and unconsciously her feeling infected him he too like her felt joyous and happy 
 they enjoyed hearing the epistle read and the roll of the voice at the last verse awaited with such impatience by the outside public they enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water and they were still more pleased when the priest flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting isaiah rejoice shcherbatsky and chirikov supporting the crowns and stumbling over the train smiling too and seeming delighted at something were at one moment left behind at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church it seemed to levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did 
 taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young couple levin looked at kitty and he had never before seen her look as she did she was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face levin longed to say something to her but he did not know whether it was all over the priest got him out of his difficulty he smiled his kindly smile and said gently kiss your wife and you kiss your husband and took the candles out of their hands 
 levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care gave her his arm and with a new strange sense of closeness walked out of the church he did not believe he could not believe that it was true it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it because he felt that they were one 
 after supper the same night the young people left for the country

 vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe they had visited venice rome and naples and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time 
 a handsome headwaiter with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upward wearing an evening coat a broad white cambric shirt front and a bunch of watch charms dangling above his small bay window stood with his hands in his pockets looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped still catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry toward the staircase the headwaiter turned round and seeing the russian count who had taken their best rooms he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially and with a bow informed him that a courier had come and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged the steward was prepared to sign the agreement 
 ah glad to hear it said vronsky is madame at home or not 
 madame has been out for a walk but has returned now answered the waiter 
 vronsky took off his soft hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair which had grown half over his ears and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head and glancing casually at the gentleman who still stood there gazing intently at him he would have gone on 
 this gentleman is a russian and was inquiring after you said the headwaiter 
 with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life vronsky looked once more at the gentleman who had retreated and stood still again and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both 
 golenishchev 
 vronsky 
 it really was golenishchev a comrade of in the corps of pages in the corps golenishchev had belonged to the liberal party he left the corps without entering the army and had never taken office under the government vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps and had only met once since 
 at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishchev had taken up a sort of lofty intellectually liberal line and was consequently disposed to look down upon interests and calling in life hence vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume the meaning of which was you may like or dislike my ways of life a matter of the most perfect indifference to me you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me golenishchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by vronsky that meeting might have been expected to estrange them still more but now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see golenishchev but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was he forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade the same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on face 
 how glad i am to meet you said vronsky showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile 
 i heard the name vronsky but i know which one very very glad 
 go in come tell me what doing 
 been living here for two years working 
 ah said vronsky with sympathy go in 
 and with the habit common among russians instead of saying in russian what he wanted to keep from the servants he began to speak in french 
 do you know madame karenina we are traveling together i am going to see her now he said in french carefully scrutinizing face 
 ah i did not know though he did know golenishchev answered carelessly have you been here long he added 
 three days vronsky answered once more scrutinizing his face intently 
 yes a decent fellow and will look at the thing properly vronsky said to himself catching the significance of face and the change of subject i can introduce him to anna he looks at it properly 
 during the three months that vronsky had spent abroad with anna he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with anna and for the most part in men he had met with the proper way of looking at it but if he had been asked and those who looked at it properly had been asked exactly how they did look at it both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer 
 in reality those who in opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all but behaved in general as persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides they behaved with propriety avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions they assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation of accepting and even approving of it but of considering it superfluous and to put all this into words 
 vronsky at once divined that golenishchev was of this class and therefore was doubly pleased to see him and in fact manner to madame karenina when he was taken to call on her was all that vronsky could have desired obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment 
 he had never met anna before and was struck by her beauty and still more by the naturalness with which she accepted her position she blushed when vronsky brought in golenishchev and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face but what he liked particularly was the way in which at once as though on purpose so that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider she called vronsky simply alexei and said they were moving into a house they had just taken what was here called a palazzo golenishchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position looking at manner of simplehearted spirited gaiety and knowing alexei alexandrovich and vronsky golenishchev fancied that he understood her perfectly he fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand how it was that having made her husband wretched having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name she yet felt full of spirits gaiety and happiness 
 in the guidebook said golenishchev referring to the palazzo vronsky had taken a tintoretto there one of his latest period 
 i tell you what a lovely day go and have another look at it said vronsky addressing anna 
 i shall be very glad to go and put on my hat would you say hot she said stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at vronsky and again a vivid flush overspread her face 
 vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with golenishchev and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish 
 he bestowed a long tender look at her 
 no not very he said 
 and it seemed to her that she understood everything most of all that he was pleased with her and smiling to him she walked with her rapid step out of the door 
 the friends glanced at one another and a look of hesitation came into both faces as though golenishchev unmistakably admiring her would have liked to say something about her and could not find the right thing to say while vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so 
 well then vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort so settled here still at the same work then he went on recalling that he had been told golenishchev was writing something 
 yes writing the second part of the two elements said golenishchev coloring with pleasure at the question that is to be exact i am not writing it yet i am preparing collecting materials it will be of far wider scope and will touch on almost all questions we in russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views 
 vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the two elements of which the author spoke as something well known but as golenishchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the two elements he listened to him with some interest for golenishchev spoke well but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishchev talked of the subject that engrossed him as he went on talking his eyes glittered more and more angrily he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents and his face grew more and more excited and worried remembering golenishchev a thin lively and boy always at the head of the class vronsky could not make out the reason for his irritability and he did not like it what he particularly disliked was that golenishchev a man belonging to a good set should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows with whom he was irritated and angry was it worth it vronsky disliked it yet he felt that golenishchev was unhappy and was sorry for him unhappiness almost mental derangement was visible on his mobile rather handsome face as without even noticing coming in he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views 
 when anna came in in her hat and cape her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol and stood beside him it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishchev which fastened persistently upon him and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion full of life and happiness golenishchev recovered himself with an effort and at first was dejected and gloomy but anna disposed as she was at that time to feel friendly with everyone soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner after trying various subjects of conversation she got him upon painting of which he talked very well and she listened to him attentively they walked to the house they had taken and looked over it 
 i am very glad of one thing said anna to golenishchev when they were on their way back alexei will have a capital atelier you must certainly take that room she said to vronsky in russian using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishchev would become intimate with them in their isolation and that there was no need of reserve before him 
 do you paint said golenishchev turning round quickly to vronsky 
 yes i used to study long ago and now i have begun to do a little said vronsky reddening 
 he has great talent said anna with a delighted smile no judge of course but good judges have said the same

 one consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture and when now she recalled all the past she remembered that one reflection i have inevitably made that man wretched she thought but i want to profit by his misery i too am suffering and shall suffer i am losing what i prized above everything i am losing my good name and my son i have done wrong and so i want happiness i want a divorce and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child but however sincerely anna had meant to suffer she was not suffering shame there was none with the tact of which both had such a large share they had succeeded in avoiding russian ladies abroad and so had never placed themselves in a false position and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position far better indeed than they did themselves separation from the son she loved even that did not cause her anguish in these early days the baby girl his child was so sweet and had so won heart since she was all that was left her that anna rarely thought of her son 
 the desire for life waxing stronger with recovered health was so intense and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant that anna felt unpardonably happy the more she got to know vronsky the more she loved him she loved him for himself and for his love for her her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her his presence was always sweet to her all the traits of his character which she learned to know better and better were unutterably dear to her his appearance changed by his civilian dress was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love in everything he said thought and did she saw something particularly noble and elevated her adoration of him alarmed her indeed she sought and could not find in him anything not fine she dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him it seemed to her that knowing this he might sooner cease to love her and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love though she had no grounds for fearing it but she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her and showing that she appreciated it he who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career in which he would have been certain to play a leading part he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake and never betrayed the slightest regret he was more lovingly respectful to her than ever and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant he so manly a man never opposed her had indeed with her no will of his own and was anxious it seemed for nothing but to anticipate her wishes and she could not but appreciate this even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her sometimes weighed upon her 
 vronsky meanwhile in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired was not perfectly happy he soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected it showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires for a time after joining his life to hers and putting on civilian dress he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before and of freedom in his love and he was content but not for long he was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires longing without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice taking it for a desire and an object sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way since they were living abroad in complete freedom outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in peterburg as for the amusements of bachelor existence which had provided vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad they could not be thought of since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in anna quite out of proportion with the cause a late supper with bachelor friends relations with the society of the place foreign and russian were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position the inspection of objects of interest apart from the fact that everything had been seen already had not for vronsky a russian and a sensible man the inexplicable significance englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit 
 and just as the hungry animal eagerly clutches every object it can get hoping to find nourishment in it vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics then at new books and then at pictures 
 as he had ever since he was a child a taste for painting and as not knowing what to spend his money on he had begun collecting engravings he came to a stop at painting began to take interest in it and concentrated upon it the unoccupied fund of desires which demanded satisfaction 
 as he had a capacity for understanding art and for true and tasteful imitation in the art of painting he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select religious historical realistic or genre painting he set to work to paint he appreciated all kinds and could have felt inspired by any one of them but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school since he knew nothing of this and drew his inspiration not directly from life but indirectly from life embodied in art his inspiration came very quickly and easily and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate

 the old neglected palazzo with its lofty plastic plafonds and frescoes on the walls with its floors of mosaic with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows with its vases on pedestals and its open fireplaces its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms hung with pictures this palazzo did much by its very appearance after they had moved into it to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman a retired officer of the life guards as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts himself a modest artist who had renounced the world his connections and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved 
 the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful and having through golenishchev made the acquaintance of a few interesting people for a time he was satisfied he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting and studied medieval italian life medieval italian life so fascinated vronsky that even his hat and a plaid flung over his shoulder were worn in the medieval style which indeed was extremely becoming to him 
 here we live and know nothing of going on vronsky said to golenishchev when the latter came to see him one morning have you seen picture he said handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning and pointing to an article on a russian artist living in the very same town and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about and had been bought beforehand the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support 
 seen it answered golenishchev of course not without talent but all in a wrong direction all the attitude to christ and to religious painting 
 what is the subject of the picture asked anna 
 christ before pilate christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school 
 and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories golenishchev launched forth into a disquisition on it 
 i understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters and therefore if they want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a sage let them take from history a socrates a franklin a charlotte corday but not christ they take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art and then 
 and is it true that this mikhailov is in such poverty asked vronsky thinking that as a russian maecenas it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad 
 hardly a remarkable portrait painter have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassilkova but i believe he care about painting any more portraits and so likely as not he may be in want i maintain that 
 we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna said vronsky 
 why mine said anna after yours i want another portrait better have one of annie so she called her baby girl here she is she added looking out of the window at the handsome italian nurse who was carrying the child out into the garden and immediately glancing unperceived at vronsky the handsome nurse from whom vronsky was painting a head for his picture was the one hidden grief in life he painted with her as his model admired her beauty and medievalism and anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son 
 vronsky too glanced out of the window and into eyes and turning at once to golenishchev he said 
 do you know this mikhailov 
 i have met him but a queer fish and quite without breeding you know one of those savage new people one is forever coming across nowadays one of those freethinkers you know who are reared in theories of atheism negation and materialism in former days said golenishchev not observing or not willing to observe that both anna and vronsky wanted to speak in former days the freethinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion law and morality and only through conflict and struggle came to free thought but now there has sprung up a new type of native freethinker who grows up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion of the existence of authorities who grows up directly in ideas of negation in everything that is to say a savage well of that class the son it appears of some moscow butler and has never had any sort of when he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried as no fool to educate himself and he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture the magazines in old times you see a man who wanted to educate himself a frenchman for instance would have set to work to study all the classics theologians and tragedians and historians and philosophers and you see all the intellectual work that came in his way but in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation and all set and not all twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities with the creeds of the ages he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else just evolution natural selection the struggle for existence and all in my article 
 i tell you what said anna who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him and ordering a portrait of him i tell you what she said resolutely interrupting golenishchev who was still talking away go and see him 
 golenishchev recovered his and readily agreed but as the artist lived in a remote ward of the town it was decided to take a carriage 
 an hour later anna with golenishchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage facing them drove up to an ugly new house in a remote ward on learning from the wife who came out to them that mikhailov saw visitors at his studio but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off they sent her to him with their cards asking permission to see his pictures

 the artist mikhailov was as always at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishchev were brought to him in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady who had been asking for money 
 said it to you twenty times enter into details fool enough at all times and when you start explaining things in italian a triple fool he said after a long dispute 
 let it run so long not my fault if i had the money 
 leave me in peace for sake mikhailov shrieked with tears in his voice and stopping his ears he went off into his working room on the other side of a partition wall and closed the door after him no sense in her he said to himself sat down to the table and opening a portfolio he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun 
 never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him and especially when he quarreled with his wife oh damn them all he thought as he went on working he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage a sketch had been made before but he was dissatisfied with it no that one was better where is it he went back to his wife and scowling and not looking at her asked his eldest little girl where was that piece of paper he had given them the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found but it was dirty and spotted with candle grease still he took the sketch laid it on his table and moving a little away screwing up his eyes he fell to gazing at it all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully 
 it it he said and at once picking up the pencil he began drawing rapidly the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose 
 he had sketched this new pose when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars a vigorous face with a prominent chin and he sketched this very face this chin on to the figure of the man he laughed aloud with delight the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living and such that it could never be changed that figure lived and was clearly and unmistakably defined the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure the legs indeed could and must be put differently and the position of the left hand must be quite altered the hair too might be thrown back but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure he was as it were stripping off the veils which hindered it from being distinctly seen each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him 
 coming coming 
 he went in to his wife 
 come sasha be cross he said smiling timidly and affectionately at her you were to blame i was to blame make it all right and having made peace with his wife he put on an overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat and went toward his studio the successful figure he had already forgotten now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence russians who had come in their carriage 
 of his picture the one that stood now on his easel he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction that no one had ever painted a picture like it he did not believe that this picture was better than all the pictures of raphael but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture no one ever had conveyed this he knew positively and had known a long while ever since he had begun to paint it but other criticisms whatever they might be had yet immense consequence in his eyes and they agitated him to the depths of his soul any remark the most insignificant which showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he himself saw in the picture agitated him to the depths of his soul he always attributed to his judges a more profound comprehension than he had himself and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture and often in their criticisms he fancied that he found this 
 he walked rapidly to the door of his studio and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to golenishchev who was eagerly telling her something while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist he was himself unconscious how as he approached them he seized on this impression and absorbed it as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it the visitors not agreeably impressed beforehand by account of the artist were still less so by his personal appearance thickset and of middle height with nimble movements with his brown hat coat and narrow trousers though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion most of all with the ordinariness of his broad face and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity mikhailov made an unpleasant impression

 on entering the studio mikhailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination expression too and especially his jaws although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer he rapidly and subtly formed from imperceptible signs a mental image of these three persons that fellow golenishchev was a russian living here mikhailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him nor what he had said to him he only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen but he remembered too that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression the abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face which had only one expression a petty childish peevish expression concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose vronsky and madame karenina must be mikhailov supposed distinguished and wealthy russians knowing nothing about art like all those wealthy russians but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs most likely already looked at all the antiques and now making the round of the studios of the new people the german humbug and the cracked english fellow and have only come to me to make the point of view complete he thought he was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have the cleverer they were the worse he found them of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is lost and the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained he expected all this he saw it all in their faces he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves stared at the lay figures and busts and walked about in leisurely fashion waiting for him to uncover his picture but in spite of this while he was turning over his studies pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet he was in intense excitement especially as in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians were certain to be beasts and fools he liked vronsky and still more anna 
 here if you please he said moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture the exhortation by pilate matthew chapter he said feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion he moved away and stood behind them 
 for the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence mikhailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider for those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher juster criticism would be uttered by them by those very visitors whom he had been despising so a moment before he forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him he saw the picture with their indifferent new outside eyes and saw nothing good in it he saw in the foreground irritated face and the serene face of christ and in the background the figures of retinue and the face of john watching what was happening every face that with such exertion such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character every face that had given him such torments and such raptures and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor all of this together seemed to him now looking at it with their eyes the merest vulgarity something that had been done a thousand times over the face dearest to him the face of christ the center of the picture which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes he saw a no not even that he distinctly saw now a mass of defects repetition of those endless christs of titian raphael rubens and the same soldiers and pilate it was all common poor and stale and badly painted weak and motley they would be justified in repeating hypocritically courteous speeches in the presence of the painter and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again 
 the silence though it lasted no more than a minute became too intolerable to him to break it and to show he was not agitated he made an effort and addressed golenishchev 
 i think had the pleasure of meeting you he said looking uneasily first at anna then at vronsky in fear of losing any shade of their expression 
 to be sure we met at do you remember at that soiree when that italian lady recited the new rachel golenishchev answered easily removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist 
 noticing however that mikhailov was expecting a criticism of the picture he said 
 your picture has got on a great deal since i saw it last time and what strikes me particularly now as it did then is the figure of pilate one so knows the man a capital fellow but an official through and through who knows not what he doth but i fancy 
 all of mobile face beamed at once his eyes sparkled he tried to say something but he could not speak for excitement and pretended to be coughing low as was his opinion of capacity for understanding art trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points mikhailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation he had himself thought about figure just what golenishchev had said the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections which as mikhailov knew for certain would be true did not diminish for him the significance of remark his heart warmed to golenishchev for this remark and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living mikhailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate but his lips quivered intractably and he could not pronounce the words vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice which partly to avoid hurting the feelings and partly to avoid giving loud utterance to something silly so easily done when talking of art people use at exhibitions of pictures mikhailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too he went up to them 
 how marvelous expression is said anna of all she saw she liked that expression most of all and she felt that it was the center of the picture and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist one can see that he is pitying pilate 
 this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ she said that he was pitying pilate in expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity since there is an expression of love of unearthly peace of preparedness for death and a sense of the vanity of words of course there is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ considering that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life all this and much more flashed into thoughts and his face beamed with delight again 
 yes and how that figure is done what atmosphere one can walk round it said golenishchev unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure 
 yes a wonderful mastery said vronsky how those figures in the background stand out there you have technique he said addressing golenishchev alluding to a conversation between them about despair of attaining this technique 
 yes yes marvelous golenishchev and anna assented 
 in spite of the excited condition in which he was the sentence about technique had sent a pang to heart and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled he had often heard this word technique and was utterly unable to understand what was meant by it he knew that by this term was meant a mechanical dexterity for painting or drawing entirely apart from its subject he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality as though one could paint well something that was bad he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the veils to avoid injuring the creation itself and to take off all the veils but there was no art of painting no technique of any sort about it if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw either would have been able to peel the veils off what was seen and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical faculty paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first besides he saw that if it came to talking about technique it was impossible to praise him for it in all he had painted he saw faults that hurt his eyes coming from want of care in taking off the veils faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole and in almost all the figures and faces he saw too remnants of the veils not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture 
 one thing might be said if you will allow me to make the remark observed golenishchev 
 oh i shall be delighted i beg of you to do so said mikhailov with a forced smile 
 that is you make him the and not the but i know that was what you meant to do 
 i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart said mikhailov morosely 
 yes but in that case if you will allow me to say what i think your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it and besides it is only my personal opinion with you it is different your very motive is different but let us take ivanov i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject fresh untouched 
 but if this is the greatest subject presented to art 
 if one looked one would find others but the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike is it god or is it not god and the unity of the impression is destroyed 
 why so i think that for educated people said mikhailov the question cannot exist 
 golenishchev did not agree with this and confounded mikhailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art 
 mikhailov was greatly perturbed but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea

 all of mobile face beamed at once his eyes sparkled he tried to say something but he could not speak for excitement and pretended to be coughing low as was his opinion of capacity for understanding art trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points mikhailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation he had himself thought about figure just what golenishchev had said the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections which as mikhailov knew for certain would be true did not diminish for him the significance of remark his heart warmed to golenishchev for this remark and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living mikhailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate but his lips quivered intractably and he could not pronounce the words vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice which partly to avoid hurting the feelings and partly to avoid giving loud utterance to something silly so easily done when talking of art people use at exhibitions of pictures mikhailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too he went up to them 
 how marvelous expression is said anna of all she saw she liked that expression most of all and she felt that it was the center of the picture and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist one can see that he is pitying pilate 
 this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ she said that he was pitying pilate in expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity since there is an expression of love of unearthly peace of preparedness for death and a sense of the vanity of words of course there is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ considering that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life all this and much more flashed into thoughts and his face beamed with delight again 
 yes and how that figure is done what atmosphere one can walk round it said golenishchev unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure 
 yes a wonderful mastery said vronsky how those figures in the background stand out there you have technique he said addressing golenishchev alluding to a conversation between them about despair of attaining this technique 
 yes yes marvelous golenishchev and anna assented 
 in spite of the excited condition in which he was the sentence about technique had sent a pang to heart and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled he had often heard this word technique and was utterly unable to understand what was meant by it he knew that by this term was meant a mechanical dexterity for painting or drawing entirely apart from its subject he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality as though one could paint well something that was bad he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the veils to avoid injuring the creation itself and to take off all the veils but there was no art of painting no technique of any sort about it if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw either would have been able to peel the veils off what was seen and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical faculty paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first besides he saw that if it came to talking about technique it was impossible to praise him for it in all he had painted he saw faults that hurt his eyes coming from want of care in taking off the veils faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole and in almost all the figures and faces he saw too remnants of the veils not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture 
 one thing might be said if you will allow me to make the remark observed golenishchev 
 oh i shall be delighted i beg of you to do so said mikhailov with a forced smile 
 that is you make him the and not the but i know that was what you meant to do 
 i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart said mikhailov morosely 
 yes but in that case if you will allow me to say what i think your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it and besides it is only my personal opinion with you it is different your very motive is different but let us take ivanov i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject fresh untouched 
 but if this is the greatest subject presented to art 
 if one looked one would find others but the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike is it god or is it not god and the unity of the impression is destroyed 
 why so i think that for educated people said mikhailov the question cannot exist 
 golenishchev did not agree with this and confounded mikhailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art 
 mikhailov was greatly perturbed but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea

 anna and vronsky had long been exchanging glances regretting their flow of cleverness at last vronsky without waiting for the artist walked away to another small picture 
 oh how exquisite what a lovely thing a gem how exquisite they cried with one voice 
 what is it so pleased with thought mikhailov he had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago he had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night he had forgotten as he always forgot the pictures he had finished he did not even like to look at it and had only brought it out because he was expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it 
 oh only an old study he said 
 how fine said golenishchev he too with unmistakable sincerity falling under the spell of the picture 
 two boys were angling in the shade of a willow tree the elder had just dropped in the hook and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush entirely absorbed in what he was doing the other a little younger was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows with his tangled flaxen head in his hands staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes what was he thinking of 
 the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mikhailov but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past and so even though this praise was grateful to him he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture 
 but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale to mikhailov at that moment excited by visitors it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters 
 it is put up there to be sold he answered scowling gloomily 
 when the visitors had gone mikhailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ and in his mind went over what had been said and what though not said had been implied by those visitors and strange to say what had had such weight with him while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view suddenly lost all importance for him he began to look at his picture with all his own full vision and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility and so of the significance of his picture a conviction essential to the intensest fervor excluding all other interests in which alone he could work 
 foreshortened leg was not right though he took his palette and began to work as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background which his visitors had not even noticed but which he knew was beyond perfection when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure but he felt too much excited for that he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too clearly there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration at which work was possible today he was too much agitated he would have covered the picture but he stopped holding the cloth in his hand and smiling blissfully gazed a long while at the figure of john at last tearing himself away with evident regret he dropped the cloth and exhausted but happy went home 
 vronsky anna and golenishchev on their way home were particularly lively and cheerful they talked of mikhailov and his pictures the word talent by which they meant an inborn almost physical aptitude apart from brain and heart and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life recurred particularly often in their talk as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of though they wanted to talk of it they said that there was no denying his talent but that his talent could not develop for want of education the common defect of our russian artists but the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories and they were continually coming back to it what an exquisite thing how he has succeeded in it and how simply he even comprehend how good it is yes i let it slip i must buy it said vronsky

 mikhailov sold vronsky his picture and agreed to paint a portrait of anna on the day fixed he came and began the work 
 from the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone especially vronsky not only by its resemblance but by its characteristic beauty it was strange how mikhailov could have discovered precisely the beauty characteristic of her one needs to know and love her as i have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul vronsky thought though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul but the expression was so true that he and others too fancied they had long known it 
 i have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything he said of his own portrait of her and he just looked and painted it where technique comes in 
 that will come was the consoling reassurance given him by golenishchev in whose view vronsky had both talent and what was most important education giving him an exalted outlook on art faith in talent was propped up by his own need of sympathy and approval for his own essays and ideas and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual 
 in another house and especially in palazzo mikhailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio he behaved with hostile deference as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect he called vronsky your excellency and notwithstanding and invitations he would never stay to dinner nor come except for the sittings anna was even more friendly to him than to other people and was very grateful for her portrait vronsky was more than courteous with him and was obviously interested to know the opinion of his picture golenishchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into mikhailov but mikhailov remained equally chilly to all of these people anna was aware from his eyes that he liked to look at her but he avoided conversation with her talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown picture he was unmistakably bored by conversation and he did not attempt to oppose him 
 altogether mikhailov with his reserved and disagreeable and apparently hostile attitude was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better and they were glad when the sittings were over and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession and he gave up coming 
 golenishchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them which was that mikhailov was simply envious of vronsky 
 not envious let us say since he has talent but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society and a count too you know these fellows detest all that can without any particular trouble do as well if not better than he who has devoted all his life to it and more than all a question of education which he lacks 
 vronsky defended mikhailov but at the bottom of his heart he believed this because in his view a man of a different lower world would be sure to be envious 
 portrait the same subject painted from nature both by him and by mikhailov ought to have shown vronsky the difference between him and mikhailov but he did not see it only after portrait was painted did he leave off painting his own portrait of anna deciding that it was no longer needed his picture of medieval life he went on with and he himself and golenishchev and still more anna thought it very good because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than picture 
 mikhailov meanwhile although portrait greatly fascinated him was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over and he had no longer to listen to disquisitions upon art and could forget about painting he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked but it was distasteful to him a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll and kissing it but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved it would be distasteful to the lover just such a distasteful sensation was what mikhailov felt at the sight of painting he felt it both ludicrous and irritating both pitiable and offensive 
 interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture the picture came to a standstill he was vaguely aware that its defects inconspicuous at first would be glaring if he were to go on with it the same experience befell him as golenishchev who felt that he had nothing to say and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature that he was working it out and collecting material this exasperated and tortured golenishchev but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself and even more incapable of exasperation with his characteristic decision without explanation or apology he simply ceased work at painting 
 but without this occupation the life of vronsky and of anna who wondered at his loss of interest in it struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty the spots on the curtains the cracks in the floors the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious and the everlasting sameness of golenishchev and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome that they had to make some change they resolved to go to russia to the country in peterburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother while anna meant to see her son the summer they intended to spend on great family estate

 levin had been married two months he was happy but not at all in the way he had expected to be at every step he found disenchantment in his former dreams and new unexpected enchantment he was happy but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined at every step he experienced what a man would experience who after admiring the smooth happy course of a little boat on a lake should get himself into that little boat he saw that it was not all sitting still and floating smoothly that one had to think too not for an instant forgetting where one was floating and that there was water under one and that one must row and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore and that it was only easy to look at but that doing it though very delightful was very difficult 
 as a bachelor when he had watched other married life had seen the petty cares the squabbles the jealousy he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart in his future married life there could be he was convinced nothing of that sort even the external forms indeed he fancied must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything and all of a sudden instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern it was on the contrary entirely made up of the pettiest details which he had so despised before but which now by no will of his own had gained an extraordinary and indisputable importance and levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before although levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life unconsciously like all men he pictured domestic life only as enjoyment of love with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract he ought as he conceived the position to do his work and to find repose from it in the happiness of love she ought to be beloved and nothing more but like all men he forgot that she too would want work and he was surprised that she his poetic exquisite kitty could not merely in the first weeks but even in the first days of their married life think remember and busy herself about tablecloths and furniture about mattresses for visitors about a tray about the cook and the dinner and so on while they were still engaged he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country as though she knew of something she wanted and could still think of something outside her love this had jarred upon him then and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times but he saw that this was essential for her and loving her as he did though he did not understand the reason for them and jeered at these domestic pursuits he could not help admiring them he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from moscow rearranged their rooms hung up curtains prepared rooms for visitors and for dolly saw after an abode for her new maid ordered dinner of the old cook came into collision with agathya mikhailovna taking from her the charge of the stores he saw how the old cook smiled admiring her and listening to her inexperienced impossible orders how mournfully and tenderly agathya mikhailovna shook her head over the young new arrangements in the pantry he saw that kitty was extraordinarily sweet when laughing and crying she came to tell him that her maid masha was used to looking upon her as her young lady and so no one obeyed her it seemed to him sweet but strange and he thought it would have been better without this 
 he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing she who at home had sometimes wanted some pickled cabbage or sweets without the possibility of getting either now could order what she liked buy pounds of sweets spend as much money as she liked and order any cakes she pleased 
 she was dreaming with delight now of coming to them with her children especially because she would order for the children their favorite cakes and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping she did not know herself why and wherefore but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her instinctively feeling the approach of spring and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too she built her nest as best she could and was in haste at the same time to build and to learn how to do it 
 this care for domestic details in kitty so opposed to ideal of exalted happiness was at first one of the disenchantments and this sweet care of her household the aim of which he did not understand but could not help loving was one of the new enchantments 
 another disenchantment and enchantment consisted of their quarrels levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender respectful and loving and all at once in the very early days they quarreled so that she said he did not care for her that he cared for no one but himself burst into tears and waved her hands 
 this first quarrel arose from having gone out to a new grange and having been away half an hour too long because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way he drove home thinking of nothing but her of her love of his own happiness and the nearer he drew to home the warmer was his tenderness for her he ran into the room with the same feeling with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shcherbatskys house to propose and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her he would have kissed her she pushed him away 
 what is it 
 been enjoying yourself she began trying to be calm and spiteful 
 but as soon as she opened her mouth she burst into a stream of reproach of senseless jealousy of all that had been torturing her during that which she had spent sitting motionless at the window it was only then for the first time that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began he felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant he was offended for the first instant but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her that she was himself he felt for the first moment as a man feels when having suddenly received a violent blow from behind he turns round angry and eager to avenge himself to look for his antagonist and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself that there is no one to be angry with and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain 
 never afterward did he feel it with such intensity but this first time he could not for a long while get over it his natural feeling urged him to defend himself to prove to her she was wrong but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on her another feeling even stronger impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still like a man in an agony of pain he wanted to tear out to fling away the seat of pain and coming to his senses he felt that the seat of pain was himself he could do nothing but try to help the seat of pain bear it and this he tried to do 
 they made peace she recognizing that she was wrong though she did not say so became tenderer to him and they experienced new redoubled happiness in their love but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again and exceedingly often too on the most unexpected and trivial grounds these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper when one was in a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peace was not broken but when both happened to be in an quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes that they could never remember afterward what they had quarreled about it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them 
 during all this early period they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension as it were a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound altogether their honeymoon that is to say the month after their wedding from which through tradition levin had expected so much was not merely not a time of sweetness but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous shameful incidents of that morbid period when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind when both were rarely quite themselves 
 it was only in the third month of their married life after their return from moscow where they had been staying for a month that their life began to go more smoothly

 another disenchantment and enchantment consisted of their quarrels levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender respectful and loving and all at once in the very early days they quarreled so that she said he did not care for her that he cared for no one but himself burst into tears and waved her hands 
 this first quarrel arose from having gone out to a new grange and having been away half an hour too long because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way he drove home thinking of nothing but her of her love of his own happiness and the nearer he drew to home the warmer was his tenderness for her he ran into the room with the same feeling with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shcherbatskys house to propose and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her he would have kissed her she pushed him away 
 what is it 
 been enjoying yourself she began trying to be calm and spiteful 
 but as soon as she opened her mouth she burst into a stream of reproach of senseless jealousy of all that had been torturing her during that which she had spent sitting motionless at the window it was only then for the first time that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began he felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant he was offended for the first instant but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her that she was himself he felt for the first moment as a man feels when having suddenly received a violent blow from behind he turns round angry and eager to avenge himself to look for his antagonist and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself that there is no one to be angry with and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain 
 never afterward did he feel it with such intensity but this first time he could not for a long while get over it his natural feeling urged him to defend himself to prove to her she was wrong but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on her another feeling even stronger impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still like a man in an agony of pain he wanted to tear out to fling away the seat of pain and coming to his senses he felt that the seat of pain was himself he could do nothing but try to help the seat of pain bear it and this he tried to do 
 they made peace she recognizing that she was wrong though she did not say so became tenderer to him and they experienced new redoubled happiness in their love but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again and exceedingly often too on the most unexpected and trivial grounds these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper when one was in a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peace was not broken but when both happened to be in an quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes that they could never remember afterward what they had quarreled about it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them 
 during all this early period they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension as it were a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound altogether their honeymoon that is to say the month after their wedding from which through tradition levin had expected so much was not merely not a time of sweetness but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous shameful incidents of that morbid period when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind when both were rarely quite themselves 
 it was only in the third month of their married life after their return from moscow where they had been staying for a month that their life began to go more smoothly

 they had just come back from moscow and were glad to be alone he was sitting at the writing table in his study writing she wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life and put on again today a dress particularly remembered and loved by him was sitting on the sofa the same leather sofa which had always stood in the study in and days she was sewing at broderie anglaise he thought and wrote never losing the happy consciousness of her presence his work both on the land and on the book in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down had not been abandoned but just as formerly his work and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness he went on with his work but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly formerly this work had been for him an escape from life formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy now this work was necessary for him so that life might not be too uniformly bright taking up his manuscript reading through what he had written he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory he was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disadvantageous condition of agriculture in russia he maintained that the poverty of russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and from misdirected reforms but that what had contributed of late years to this result was a civilization from without abnormally grafted upon russia especially facilities of communication such as railways leading to centralization in towns the development of luxury and the consequent development of manufactures credit and its accompaniment of speculation all to the detriment of agriculture it seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture when it had come under regular or at least definite conditions that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it and that in our unsettled condition of the land railways called into being by political and not by economic needs were premature and instead of promoting agriculture as was expected of them they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit and so arresting its progress and that just as the and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development so in the general development of wealth in russia credit facilities of communication manufacturing activity indubitably necessary in europe where they had arisen in their proper time had with us only done harm by throwing into the background the chief question next in turn of the organization of agriculture 
 while he was at his writing she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young prince charsky who had with great want of tact flirted with her the day before they left moscow jealous she thought my god how sweet and silly he is jealous of me if he only knew that all others are no more to me than piotr the cook she thought looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself though a pity to take him from his work but he has plenty of time i must look at his face will he feel looking at him i wish turn round will him to and she opened her eyes wide as though to intensify the influence of her gaze 
 yes they draw away all the sap and give a false resplendence he muttered stopped writing and feeling that she was looking at him and smiling he looked round 
 well he queried smiling and getting up 
 he looked round she thought 
 nothing i wanted you to look round she said watching him and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not 
 how happy we are alone together i am that is he said going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness 
 just as happy never go anywhere especially not to moscow 
 and what were you thinking about 
 i i was thinking no no go on writing break off she said pursing up her lips and i must cut out these little holes now do you see 
 she took up her scissors and began cutting them out 
 no tell me what was it he said sitting down beside her and watching the circular motion of the tiny scissors 
 oh what was i thinking about i was thinking about moscow about the nape of your neck 
 why should i of all people have such happiness unnatural too good he said kissing her hand 
 i feel quite the opposite the better things are the more natural it seems to me 
 and got a little curl loose he said carefully turning her head round a little curl oh yes no no we are busy at our work

 but it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else and especially the person nearest of all to one for the basis of dissatisfaction and it vaguely came into mind that she herself was not to blame she could not be to blame for anything but what was to blame was her education too superficial and frivolous that fool charsky i know she wanted to stop him but know how to yes apart from her interest in the house that she has apart from dress and broderie anglaise she has no serious interests no interest in my work in the estate in the peasants nor in music though rather good at it nor in reading she does nothing and is perfectly satisfied levin in his heart censured this and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house and would bear and nurse and bring up children he knew not that she was instinctively aware of this and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love which she was enjoying now while gaily building her nest for the future

 when levin went upstairs his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar and the new tea service and having settled old agathya mikhailovna at a little table with a full cup of tea was reading a letter from dolly with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence 
 you see your settled me here told me to sit a bit with her said agathya mikhailovna smiling amicably at kitty 
 in these words of agathya mikhailovna levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty he saw that in spite of agathya feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her 
 here i opened your letter too said kitty handing him an illiterate letter from that woman i think your she said i did not read it through this is from my people and from dolly fancy dolly took tania and grisha to a ball at the sarmatskys tania was a french marquise 
 but levin did not hear her flushing he took the letter from marya nikolaevna his former mistress and began to read it this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna in the first letter marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her packing for no fault of hers and with touching simplicity added that though she was in want again she asked for nothing and wished for nothing but was only tormented by the thought that nikolai dmitrievich would come to grief without her owing to the weak state of his health and begged his brother to look after him now she wrote quite differently she had found nikolai dmitrievich had again made it up with him in moscow and had moved with him to a provincial town where he had received a post in the government service but she wrote he had quarreled with the head official and was on his way back to moscow only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again always of you he has talked and besides he has no more money left 
 read this dolly writes about you kitty was beginning with a smile but she stopped suddenly noticing the changed expression on her face what is it the matter 
 she writes to me that nikolai my brother is at door i shall go to him 
 face changed at once thoughts of tania as a marquise of dolly all had vanished 
 when are you going she said 
 tomorrow 
 and i will go with you may i she said 
 kitty what are you thinking of he said reproachfully 
 what am i thinking of offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation 
 why i go i be in your way i 
 going because my brother is dying said levin why should you 
 why for the same reason as you 
 and at a moment of such gravity for me she only thinks of her being dull by herself thought levin and this subterfuge in a matter of such gravity infuriated him 
 out of the question he said sternly 
 agathya mikhailovna seeing that it was coming to a quarrel gently put down her cup and withdrew kitty did not even notice her the tone in which her husband had said the last words offended her especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said 
 i tell you that if you go i shall come with you i shall certainly come she said hastily and wrathfully why out of the question why do you say out of the question 
 because be going god knows where by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels you would be a hindrance to me said levin trying to be cool 
 not at all i want anything where you can go i can 
 well for one thing then because this there whom you meet 
 i know and care to know there and what i know that my brother is dying and my husband is going to him and i go with my husband so that 
 kitty get angry but just think a little this is a matter of such importance that i bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness of dislike to being left alone come be dull alone so go and stay at moscow a little 
 there you always ascribe base vile motives to me she said with tears of wrath and wounded pride i mean anything it weakness it anything i feel that my duty to be with my husband when in trouble but you try on purpose to hurt me you try on purpose not to understand 
 no this is awful to be such a slave cried levin getting up and unable to restrain his vexation any longer but at the same second he felt that he was beating himself 
 then why did you marry you could have been free why did you if you regret it she said getting up and running away into the drawing room 
 when he went to her she was sobbing 
 he began to speak trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her but she did not heed him and would not agree to anything he bent down to her and took her hand which resisted him he kissed her hand kissed her hair kissed her hand again still she was silent but when he took her face in both his hands and said kitty she suddenly collected herself still shed some tears and they were reconciled 
 it was decided that they should go together the next day levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use agreed that marya being with his brother did not make her going improper but he set off dissatisfied at the bottom of his heart both with her and with himself he was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary and how strange it was for him to think that he so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as the possibility of her loving him now was unhappy because she loved him too much and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with the mere idea of his wife his kitty being in the same room with a common wench set him shuddering with horror and loathing

 chapter 
 
 the hotel of the provincial town where nikolai levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements with the best intentions of cleanliness comfort and even elegance but owing to the public that patronizes them are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement and made by the very pretension worse than the honestly filthy hotels this hotel had already reached that stage and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry supposed to stand for a hall porter and the perforated somber and disagreeable staircase and the free and easy waiter in a filthy dress coat and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table and filth dust and disorder everywhere and at the same time the sort of modern railway uneasiness of this hotel aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them 
 as is invariably the case after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms it appeared that there was not one decent room for them one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads another by a lawyer from moscow a third by princess astafieva just arrived from the country there remained only one filthy room next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass that at the moment of arrival when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on he should have to be seeing after her instead of rushing straight to his brother levin conducted her to the room assigned them 
 go do go she said looking at him with timid and guilty eyes 
 he went out of the door without a word and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him she was just the same as when he had seen her in moscow the same woolen gown and bare arms and neck and the same stupid face only a little plumper 
 well how is he how is he 
 very bad he get up he has been expecting you all this while he are you with your wife 
 levin did not for the first moment understand what confused her but she immediately enlightened him 
 go away go down to the kitchen she brought out nikolai dmitrievich will be delighted he heard about it and knows her and remembers her abroad 
 levin realized that she meant his wife and did not know what answer to make 
 come along come along to him he said 
 but as soon as he moved the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out levin crimsoned both from shame and anger at his wife who had put herself and him in such a difficult position but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears and clutching the ends of her shawl in both hands twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do 
 for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this incomprehensible to her awful woman but it lasted only a single instant 
 well how is he she turned to her husband and then to her 
 but one go on talking in the passage like this levin said looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor as though about his affairs 
 well then come in said kitty turning to marya nikolaevna who had recovered herself but noticing her face of dismay or go on go and then come for me she said and went back into the room levin went to his room 
 he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his room he had expected to find him in the same state of which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive and which had struck him so much during his visit in the autumn he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked greater weakness greater emaciation but still almost the same condition of things he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then only in a greater degree and he had prepared himself for this but he found something utterly different 
 in a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle with conversation audible from the next room through the thin partition in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities on a bedstead moved away from the wall there lay covered with a quilt a body one arm of this body was above the quilt and the wrist huge as a rake handle was attached inconceivably it seemed to the thin long bobbin smooth from the beginning to the middle the head lay sideways on the pillow levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and the tensed seemingly transparent forehead 
 it cannot be that that fearful body was my brother nikolai thought levin but he went closer saw the face and doubt became impossible in spite of the terrible change in the face levin had only to glance at those eager eyes at his approach only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache to realize the terrible truth that this dead body was his living brother 
 the glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at the brother as he drew near and immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him and felt remorse at his own happiness 
 when konstantin took him by the hand nikolai smiled the smile was faint scarcely perceptible and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged 
 you did not expect to find me like this he articulated with effort 
 yes no said levin hesitating over his words how was it you let me know before that is at the time of my wedding i made inquiries in all directions 
 he had to talk so as not to be silent and he did not know what to say especially as his brother made no reply and simply stared without dropping his eyes and apparently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word levin told his brother that his wife had come with him nikolai expressed pleasure but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition a silence followed suddenly nikolai stirred and began to say something levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face but nikolai began speaking of his health he found fault with the doctor regretting he had not a celebrated moscow doctor levin saw that he still had hopes 
 seizing the first moment of silence levin got up anxious to escape if only for an instant from his agonizing emotion and said that he would go and fetch his wife 
 very well and tell masha to tidy up here dirty and stinking here i expect masha clear up the room the sick man said with effort and when cleared up you go away he added looking inquiringly at his brother 
 levin made no answer going out into the corridor he stopped short he had said he would fetch his wife but now taking stock of the emotion he was feeling he decided that on the contrary he would try to persuade her not to go in to the sick man why should she suffer as i am suffering he thought 
 well how is he kitty asked with a frightened face 
 oh awful awful what did you come for said levin 
 kitty was silent for a few seconds looking timidly and ruefully at her husband then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands 
 kostia take me to him it will be easier for us to bear it together only take me take me to him please and go away she said you must understand that for me to see you and not to see him is far more painful there i might be a help to you and to him please let me she besought her husband as though the happiness of her life depended on it 
 levin was obliged to agree and regaining his composure and completely forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now he went again in to his brother with kitty 
 stepping lightly and continually glancing at her husband showing him a valorous and sympathetic face kitty went into the sickroom and turning without haste noiselessly closed the door with inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick bedside and going up so that he would not have to turn his head she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand pressed it and began speaking with that soft eagerness sympathetic and inoffensive which is peculiar merely to women 
 we have met though we were not acquainted at soden she said you never thought i was to be your sister 
 you would not have recognized me he said with a smile which had become radiant at her entrance 
 yes i should what a good thing you let us know not a day has passed that kostia has not mentioned you and been anxious 
 but the sick interest did not last long 
 before she had finished speaking there had come back into his face the stern reproachful expression of the dying envy of the living 
 i am afraid you are not quite comfortable here she said turning away from his fixed stare and looking about the room we must ask about another room she said to her husband so that we might be nearer

 chapter 
 
 the hotel of the provincial town where nikolai levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements with the best intentions of cleanliness comfort and even elegance but owing to the public that patronizes them are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement and made by the very pretension worse than the honestly filthy hotels this hotel had already reached that stage and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry supposed to stand for a hall porter and the perforated somber and disagreeable staircase and the free and easy waiter in a filthy dress coat and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table and filth dust and disorder everywhere and at the same time the sort of modern railway uneasiness of this hotel aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them 
 as is invariably the case after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms it appeared that there was not one decent room for them one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads another by a lawyer from moscow a third by princess astafieva just arrived from the country there remained only one filthy room next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass that at the moment of arrival when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on he should have to be seeing after her instead of rushing straight to his brother levin conducted her to the room assigned them 
 go do go she said looking at him with timid and guilty eyes 
 he went out of the door without a word and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him she was just the same as when he had seen her in moscow the same woolen gown and bare arms and neck and the same stupid face only a little plumper 
 well how is he how is he 
 very bad he get up he has been expecting you all this while he are you with your wife 
 levin did not for the first moment understand what confused her but she immediately enlightened him 
 go away go down to the kitchen she brought out nikolai dmitrievich will be delighted he heard about it and knows her and remembers her abroad 
 levin realized that she meant his wife and did not know what answer to make 
 come along come along to him he said 
 but as soon as he moved the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out levin crimsoned both from shame and anger at his wife who had put herself and him in such a difficult position but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears and clutching the ends of her shawl in both hands twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do 
 for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this incomprehensible to her awful woman but it lasted only a single instant 
 well how is he she turned to her husband and then to her 
 but one go on talking in the passage like this levin said looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor as though about his affairs 
 well then come in said kitty turning to marya nikolaevna who had recovered herself but noticing her face of dismay or go on go and then come for me she said and went back into the room levin went to his room 
 he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his room he had expected to find him in the same state of which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive and which had struck him so much during his visit in the autumn he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked greater weakness greater emaciation but still almost the same condition of things he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then only in a greater degree and he had prepared himself for this but he found something utterly different

 chapter 
 
 levin could not look calmly at his brother he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence when he went in to the sick man his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his position he smelt the awful odor saw the dirt disorder and miserable condition and heard the groans and felt that nothing could be done to help it never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick situation to consider how that body was lying under the quilt how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up and whether they could not be made more comfortable whether anything could not be done to make things if not better at least not so bad it made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details he was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his life or to relieve his suffering but a consciousness of regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man and exasperated him and this made it still more painful for levin to be in the sickroom was agony to him not to be there was still worse and he was continually on various pretexts going out of the room and coming in again because he was unable to remain alone 
 but kitty thought and felt and acted quite differently on seeing the sick man she pitied him and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband but a desire to act to find out all the details of his state and to remedy them and since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him she had no doubt either that it was possible and immediately set to work the very details the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror immediately engaged her attention she sent for the doctor sent to the set the maid who had come with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub she herself washed up something washed out something else laid something under the quilt something was by her direction brought into the sickroom something else was carried out she herself went several times to her room regardless of the men she met in the corridor got out and brought in sheets pillowcases towels and shirts 
 the waiter who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons and could not avoid carrying out her orders as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her levin did not approve of all this he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient above all he was afraid the patient would be angry at it but the sick man though he seemed to be indifferent about it was not angry but only abashed and on the whole seemed interested in what she was doing with him coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him levin on opening the door came upon the sick man at the instant when by direction they were changing his linen the long white ridge of his spine with the huge prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae was bare and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the nightshirt and could not get the long limp arm into it kitty hurriedly closing the door after levin did not look in that direction but the sick man groaned and she moved rapidly toward him 
 come a little quicker she said 
 oh you come said the sick man angrily do it myself 
 what did you say queried marya nikolaevna 
 but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her 
 not looking not looking she said putting the arm in marya nikolaevna you come this side you do it she added 
 please run over for me a little bottle in my small bag she said turning to her husband you know in the side pocket bring it please and meanwhile finish clearing up here 
 returning with the bottle levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar which kitty with pouting lips and rosy cheeks was squirting through a small tube there was no dust visible anywhere a rug was laid by the bedside on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged and the linen needed was folded up there and broderie anglaise on the other table by the bed there were candles and drink and powders the sick man himself washed and combed lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows in a clean nightshirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck and with a new expression of hope was looking fixedly at kitty 
 the doctor brought by levin and found by him at the club was not the one who had been attending nikolai levin and whom he disliked the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient shook his head prescribed medicine and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be adhered to he advised eggs raw or hardly cooked and seltzer water with new milk at a certain temperature when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother of which levin could distinguish only the last words your katia by the expression with which he gazed at her levin saw that he was praising her he beckoned to him katia as he called her 
 much better already he said why with you i should have got well long ago how fine everything is he took her hand and drew it toward his lips but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind let it go and only stroked it kitty took his hand in both of hers and squeezed it 
 now turn me over on the left side and go to bed he said 
 no one could make out what he said but kitty she alone understood she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed 
 on the other side she said to her husband he always sleeps on that side turn him over so disagreeable calling the servants not strong enough can you she said to marya nikolaevna 
 afraid answered marya nikolaevna 
 terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body to take hold under the quilt of that of which he preferred to know nothing under his influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs while he was turning him over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow beat it up and settled in it the sick head smoothing back his hair which was sticking again to his moist brow 
 the sick man kept his hand in his own levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere levin yielded with a sinking heart yes he drew it to his mouth and kissed it levin shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word went out of the room

 chapter 
 
 thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening 
 levin thought of the text not because he considered himself wise and prudent he did not consider himself wise and prudent but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agathya mikhailovna and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death he thought with all the force of his intellect he knew too that the brains of many great men whose thoughts he had read had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agathya mikhailovna knew about it different as those two women were agathya mikhailovna and katia as his brother nikolai had called her and as levin particularly liked to call her now they were quite alike in this both knew without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life was and what was death and though neither of them could have answered and would not even have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin both had no doubt of the significance of this event and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it which they shared with millions of people the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying and were not frightened by them levin and other men like him though they could have said a great deal about death obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying if levin had been alone now with his brother nikolai he would have looked at him with terror and with still greater terror waited and would not have known what else to do 
 more than that he did not know what to say how to look how to move to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking impossible to talk of death and depressing subjects also impossible to be silent was also impossible if i look at him he will think i am studying him i am afraid of him if i look at him think thinking of other things if i walk on tiptoe he will be vexed to tread firmly ashamed kitty evidently did not think of herself and had no time to think about herself she was thinking about him because she knew something and all went well she even told him about herself and about her wedding and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him and talked of cases of recovery and all went well therefore she must know the proof that her behavior and agathya was not instinctive animal irrational lay in that apart from the physical treatment the relief of suffering both agathya mikhailovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions agathya mikhailovna speaking of a man recently dead had said well thank god he took the sacrament and received extreme unction god grant each one of us such a death katia in just the same way besides all her care about linen bedsores drink found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving extreme unction 
 on getting back from the sickroom to their own two rooms for the night levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do to say nothing of supper of preparing for bed of considering what they were going to do he could not even talk to his wife he was ashamed to kitty on the contrary was more active than usual she was even livelier than usual she ordered supper to be brought herself unpacked their things and herself helped to make the beds and did not even forget to sprinkle them with persian insecticide she showed that alertness that swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle in conflict in the dangerous and decisive moments of life those moments when a man shows once and for all his value and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments 
 everything went rapidly in her hands and before it was twelve all their things were arranged tidily and orderly in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home like her rooms the beds were made brushes combs looking glasses were put out table napkins were spread 
 levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat to sleep to talk even now and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly she arranged the brushes but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it 
 they could neither of them eat however and for a long while they could not sleep and did not even go to bed 
 i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow she said sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass combing her soft fragrant hair with a comb i have never seen it but i know mamma has told me there are prayers said for recovery 
 do you suppose he can possibly recover said levin watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front 
 i asked the doctor he said he live more than three days but can they be sure very glad anyway that i persuaded him she said looking askance at her husband through her hair anything is possible she added with that peculiar rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion 
 since their conversation about religion during their engagement neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church saying her prayers and so on always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so in spite of his assertion to the contrary she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she and indeed a far better one and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks just as he would say about her broderie anglaise that good people patch holes but that she cut them out on purpose and so on 
 yes you see this woman marya nikolaevna did not know how to manage all this said levin and i must own very very glad you came you are such purity that he took her hand and did not kiss it to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper he merely squeezed it with a penitent air looking at her brightening eyes 
 it would have been miserable for you to be alone she said and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there no she went on she did not know how luckily i learned lot at soden 
 surely there are no people there so ill 
 worse 
 so awful to me is that i but see him as he was when he was young you would not believe how charming he was as a youth but i did not understand him then 
 i can quite quite believe it how i feel that we might have been friends she said and distressed at what she had said she looked round at her husband and tears came into her eyes 
 yes might have been he said mournfully just one of those people of whom they say that they are not for this world 
 but we have many days before us we must go to bed said kitty glancing at her tiny watch

 more than that he did not know what to say how to look how to move to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking impossible to talk of death and depressing subjects also impossible to be silent was also impossible if i look at him he will think i am studying him i am afraid of him if i look at him think thinking of other things if i walk on tiptoe he will be vexed to tread firmly ashamed kitty evidently did not think of herself and had no time to think about herself she was thinking about him because she knew something and all went well she even told him about herself and about her wedding and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him and talked of cases of recovery and all went well therefore she must know the proof that her behavior and agathya was not instinctive animal irrational lay in that apart from the physical treatment the relief of suffering both agathya mikhailovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions agathya mikhailovna speaking of a man recently dead had said well thank god he took the sacrament and received extreme unction god grant each one of us such a death katia in just the same way besides all her care about linen bedsores drink found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving extreme unction 
 on getting back from the sickroom to their own two rooms for the night levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do to say nothing of supper of preparing for bed of considering what they were going to do he could not even talk to his wife he was ashamed to kitty on the contrary was more active than usual she was even livelier than usual she ordered supper to be brought herself unpacked their things and herself helped to make the beds and did not even forget to sprinkle them with persian insecticide she showed that alertness that swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle in conflict in the dangerous and decisive moments of life those moments when a man shows once and for all his value and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments 
 everything went rapidly in her hands and before it was twelve all their things were arranged tidily and orderly in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home like her rooms the beds were made brushes combs looking glasses were put out table napkins were spread 
 levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat to sleep to talk even now and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly she arranged the brushes but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it 
 they could neither of them eat however and for a long while they could not sleep and did not even go to bed 
 i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow she said sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass combing her soft fragrant hair with a comb i have never seen it but i know mamma has told me there are prayers said for recovery 
 do you suppose he can possibly recover said levin watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front 
 i asked the doctor he said he live more than three days but can they be sure very glad anyway that i persuaded him she said looking askance at her husband through her hair anything is possible she added with that peculiar rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion 
 since their conversation about religion during their engagement neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church saying her prayers and so on always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so in spite of his assertion to the contrary she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she and indeed a far better one and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks just as he would say about her broderie anglaise that good people patch holes but that she cut them out on purpose and so on 
 yes you see this woman marya nikolaevna did not know how to manage all this said levin and i must own very very glad you came you are such purity that he took her hand and did not kiss it to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper he merely squeezed it with a penitent air looking at her brightening eyes 
 it would have been miserable for you to be alone she said and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there no she went on she did not know how luckily i learned lot at soden 
 surely there are no people there so ill 
 worse 
 so awful to me is that i but see him as he was when he was young you would not believe how charming he was as a youth but i did not understand him then 
 i can quite quite believe it how i feel that we might have been friends she said and distressed at what she had said she looked round at her husband and tears came into her eyes 
 yes might have been he said mournfully just one of those people of whom they say that they are not for this world 
 but we have many days before us we must go to bed said kitty glancing at her tiny watch

 death 
 the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction during the ceremony nikolai levin prayed fervently his great eyes fastened on the holy icon that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to levin to see it levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly the parting from the life he so loved levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one brought about by way of the same working of his intellect but simply a temporary interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of levin knew all this and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist lifted with difficulty making the sign of the cross on the tense brow and the prominent shoulders and hollow gasping chest which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for during the sacrament levin offered prayers and did what he an unbeliever had done a thousand times he said addressing god if thou dost exist make this man recover of course this same thing has been repeated many times and thou wilt save him and me 
 after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better he did not cough once in the course of an hour smiled kissed hand thanking her with tears and said he was comfortable free from pain and that he felt strong and had an appetite he even raised himself when his soup was brought and asked for a cutlet as well hopelessly ill as he was obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement happy though fearful of being mistaken 
 is he better yes much wonderful nothing wonderful in it anyway better they said in a whisper smiling to one another 
 this was not of long duration the sick man fell into a quiet sleep but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough and all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself the reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself leaving no doubt no memory even of past hopes 
 without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before as though ashamed even to recall it he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper levin gave him the bottle and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother demanding from him the confirmation of the words that inhaling iodine worked wonders 
 katia here he gasped looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the words no then i can say it it was for her sake i went through that farce so sweet but you and i deceive ourselves this is what i believe in he said and squeezing the bottle in his bony hand he began breathing over it 
 at eight in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly she was pale and her lips were quivering he is dying she whispered afraid he will die right away 
 both of them ran to him he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed his long back bent and his head hanging low 
 how do you feel levin asked in a whisper after a silence 
 i feel setting off nikolai said with difficulty but with extreme distinctness deliberately squeezing the words out of himself he did not raise his head but simply turned his eyes upward without their reaching his face katia go away he added 
 levin jumped up and with a peremptory whisper made her go out 
 setting off he said again 
 why do you think so said levin so as to say something 
 because setting off he repeated as though he had a liking for the phrase the end 
 marya nikolaevna went up to him 
 you had better lie down be easier she said 
 i shall lie down soon enough he pronounced slowly when dead he said sarcastically wrathfully well you can put me down if you like 
 levin laid his brother on his back sat down beside him and gazed at his face holding his breath the dying man lay with closed eyes but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead as with one thinking deeply and intensely levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now but in spite of all his mental efforts to keep him company he saw by the expression of that calm stern face and by the playing muscle above his brow that for the dying man there was growing clearer and clearer all that was still as dark as ever for levin 
 yes yes so the dying man articulated slowly at intervals wait a little he was silent again right he pronounced all at once reassuringly as though all were solved for him o lord he murmured and sighed deeply 
 marya nikolaevna felt his feet getting cold she whispered 
 for a long while a very long while it seemed to levin the sick man lay motionless but he was still alive and from time to time he sighed levin by now was exhausted from mental strain he felt that with no mental effort could he understand what it was that was right he felt that he could not follow the dying thinking he could not even think of the problem of death itself but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next closing the dead eyes dressing him ordering the coffin and strange to say he felt utterly cold and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss less still of pity for his brother if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment it was rather envy for the knowledge the dying man had now which he could not have 
 a long time more he sat over him so continually expecting the end but the end did not come the door opened and kitty appeared levin got up to stop her but at the moment he was getting up he caught the sound of the dying man stirring 
 go away said nikolai and held out his hand levin gave him his and angrily waved to his wife to go away 
 with the dying hand in his hand he sat for half an hour an hour another hour he did not think of death at all now he wondered what kitty was doing who lived in the next room whether the doctor lived in a house of his own he longed for food and for sleep he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet the feet were cold but the sick man was still breathing levin tried once more to move away on tiptoe but the sick man stirred again and said go 
 the dawn came the sick condition was unchanged levin stealthily withdrew his hand and without looking at the dying man went off to his own room and went to sleep when he woke up instead of news of his death which he expected he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition he had begun sitting up again coughing had begun eating again talking again and again had ceased to talk of death again had begun to express hope of his recovery and had become more irritable and gloomier than ever no one neither his brother nor kitty could soothe him he was angry with everyone and said nasty things to everyone reproached everyone for his sufferings and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow to all inquiries made of him as to how he felt he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness suffering horribly intolerably the sick man was suffering more and more especially from bedsores which it was impossible now to remedy and grew more and more angry with everyone about him blaming them for everything and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him to soothe him but it was all in vain and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally though she would not admit it the sense of death which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother was broken up everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon that he was already everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible and everyone concealing this gave him medicines tried to find remedies and doctors and deceived him and themselves and one another all this was falsehood disgusting irreverent deceit and owing to the bent of his character and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit 
 levin who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers at least in face of death had written to his brother sergei ivanovich and having received an answer from him he read this letter to the sick man sergei ivanovich wrote that he could not come himself and in touching terms he begged his forgiveness 
 the sick man said nothing 
 what am i to write to him said levin i hope you are not angry with him 
 no not in the least nikolai answered vexed at the question tell him to send me a doctor 
 three more days of agony followed the sick man was still in the same condition the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now who saw him by the waiters and the hotelkeeper and all the people staying in the hotel and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty the sick man alone did not express this feeling but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors and went on taking medicine and talking of life only at rare moments when the opium gave him an relief from his pain he would sometimes utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others oh if it were only the end or when will it be over 
 his sufferings steadily growing more intense did their work and prepared him for death there was no position in which he was not in pain there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it not a limb not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony even the memories the impressions the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself the sight of other people their remarks his own reminiscences everything was for him a source of agony those about him felt this and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely to talk to express their wishes before him all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it 
 there was evidently coming over him that revulsion which would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires as happiness hitherto each individual desire aroused by suffering or privation such as hunger fatigue thirst had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure but now no physical craving or suffering received relief and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering and so all desires were merged in one the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source the body but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance and so he did not speak of it and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied turn me over on the other side he would say and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before give me some broth take away the broth talk of something why are you silent and directly they began to talk he would close his eyes and would show weariness indifference and loathing 
 on the tenth day from their arrival in the town kitty was unwell she suffered from headache and sickness and she could not get up all the morning 
 the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement and prescribed rest 
 after dinner however kitty got up and went as with her work to the sick man he looked at her sternly when she came in and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell that day he was continually blowing his nose and groaning piteously 
 how do you feel she asked him 
 worse he articulated with difficulty in pain 
 in pain where 
 everywhere 
 it will be over today you will see said marya nikolaevna though it was said in a whisper the sick man whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen must have heard levin said hush to her and looked round at the sick man nikolai had heard but these words produced no effect on him his eyes had still the same intense reproachful look 
 why do you think so levin asked her when she had followed him into the corridor 
 he has begun picking at himself said marya nikolaevna 
 how do you mean 
 like this she said tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt levin noticed indeed that all that day the patient pulled at himself as it were trying to snatch something away 
 marya prediction came true toward night the sick man was not able to lift his hands and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes even when his brother or kitty bent over him so that he could see them he looked just the same kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying 
 while the priest was reading it the dying man did not show any sign of life his eyes were closed levin kitty and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched sighed and opened his eyes the priest on finishing the prayer put the cross to the cold forehead then slowly returned it to the stand and after standing in silence for two minutes more he touched the huge bloodless hand that was turning cold 
 he is gone said the priest and would have moved away but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds 
 not quite soon 
 and a minute later the face brightened a smile came out under the mustaches and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse 
 the sight of his brother and the nearness of death revived in levin that sense of horror in the face of the insolvable enigma together with the nearness and inevitability of death that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him this feeling was now even stronger than before even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever but now thanks to his presence that feeling did not reduce him to despair in spite of death he felt the need of life and love he felt that love saved him from despair and that his love under the menace of despair had become still stronger and purer 
 the one mystery of death still unsolved had scarcely passed before his eyes when another mystery had arisen as insoluble urging him to love and to life 
 the doctor confirmed his former suppositions in regard to kitty her indisposition consisted of pregnancy

 chapter 
 
 from the moment when alexei alexandrovich understood from his interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevich that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace without burdening her with his presence and that his wife herself desired this he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision by himself he did not know himself what he wanted now and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs he met everything with unqualified assent it was only when anna had left his house and the english governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position and was appalled by it 
 most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with the present it was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him the transition from that past to a knowledge of his unfaithfulness he had already lived through miserably that state had been painful but he could understand it if his wife had then on declaring to him her unfaithfulness left him he would have been wounded unhappy but he would not have been in the hopeless position incomprehensible to himself in which he felt himself now he could not now reconcile his immediate past his tenderness his love for his sick wife and for the other child with what was now the case with the fact that seemingly in return for all this he now found himself alone put to shame a laughingstock needed by no one and despised by everyone 
 for the first two days after his departure alexei alexandrovich received petitioners and his head clerk drove to the committee and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual without giving himself a reason for what he was doing he strained every nerve of his being for those two days simply to preserve an appearance of composure and even of indifference answering inquiries about the disposition of anna rooms and belongings he had exercised immense to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events and he attained his aim no one could have detected in him any signs of despair but on the second day after her departure when kornei gave him a bill from a fashionable shop which anna had forgotten to pay and announced that the shopman was waiting alexei alexandrovich told him to show the man up 
 excuse me your excellency for venturing to trouble you but if you direct us to apply to her excellency would you graciously oblige us with her address 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered as it seemed to the shopman and all at once turning round he sat down to the table burying his head in his hands he sat for a long while in that position made several attempts to speak and stopped short 
 kornei perceiving his emotion asked the shopman to call another time left alone alexei alexandrovich realized that he had not the strength to keep up the role of firmness and composure any longer he gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back and for no one to be admitted and he did not go down to dinner 
 he felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation which he had distinctly seen in the faces of the shopman and of kornei and of everyone without exception whom he had met during these two days he felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men because that hatred did not come from his being bad in that case he could have tried to be better but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy he knew that for this for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief they would be merciless to him he felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a mangled dog yelping with pain he knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them and instinctively he tried to do this for two days but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle 
 his despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow in all peterburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling who would feel for him not as a high official not as a member of society but simply as a suffering man indeed he had not such a one in the whole world

 alexei alexandrovich had forgotten the countess lidia ivanovna but she had not forgotten him at the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him and without waiting to be announced walked straight into his study she found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands 
 forc la consigne she said walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exertion i have heard all alexei alexandrovich dear friend she went on warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his 
 alexei alexandrovich frowning got up and disengaging his hand moved a chair up for her 
 you sit down countess seeing no one because unwell countess he said and his lips twitched 
 dear friend repeated countess lidia ivanovna never taking her eyes off his and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners describing a triangle on her forehead her ugly yellow face becoming still uglier but alexei alexandrovich felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry and he too was softened he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it 
 dear friend she said in a voice breaking with emotion you ought not to give way to grief your sorrow is a great one but you ought to find consolation 
 i am crushed i am annihilated i am no longer a man said alexei alexandrovich letting go her hand but still gazing into her brimming eyes my position is so awful because i can find nowhere i cannot find within me strength to support me 
 you will find support seek it not in me though i beseech you to believe in my friendship she said with a sigh our support is love that love that he has vouchsafed us his burden is light she said with the look of ecstasy alexei alexandrovich knew so well he will be your support and your succor 
 although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in peterburg and which seemed to alexei alexandrovich disproportionate still it was pleasant to him to hear this now 
 i am weak i am crushed i foresaw nothing and now i understand nothing 
 dear friend repeated lidia ivanovna 
 not the loss of what i no longer have not that pursued alexei alexandrovich i do not grieve for that but i cannot help feeling ashamed before other people for the position i am placed in it is wrong but i help it i help it 
 it was not you who performed that noble act of forgiveness at which i was moved to ecstasy and everyone else too but he working within your heart said countess lidia ivanovna raising her eyes rapturously and so you cannot be ashamed of your act 
 alexei alexandrovich knit his brows and crooking his hands he cracked his fingers 
 one must know all the details he said in his high voice a strength has its limits countess and i have reached my limits the whole day i have had to be making arrangements arrangements about household matters arising he emphasized the word arising from my new solitary position the servants the governess the accounts these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart and i have not the strength to bear it at dinner yesterday i was almost getting up from the dinner table i could not bear the way my son looked at me he did not ask me the meaning of it all but he wanted to ask and i could not bear the look in his eyes he was afraid to look at me but that is not all alexei alexandrovich would have referred to the bill that had been brought him but his voice shook and he stopped that bill on blue paper for a hat and ribbons he could not recall without a rush of 
 i understand dear friend said lidia ivanovna i understand it all succor and comfort you will find not in me though i have come only to aid you if i can if i could take from off you all these petty humiliating cares i understand that a word a superintendence is needed you will intrust it to me 
 silently and gratefully alexei alexandrovich squeezed her hand 
 together we will take care of seriozha practical affairs are not my strong point but i will set to work i will be your housekeeper thank me i do it not from myself 
 i cannot help thanking you 
 but dear friend do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke being ashamed of what is the highest glory he who humbles himself shall be exalted and you cannot thank me you must thank him and pray to him for succor in him alone we find peace consolation salvation and love she said and turning her eyes heavenward she began praying as alexei alexandrovich gathered from her silence 
 alexei alexandrovich listened to her now and those expressions which had seemed to him if not distasteful at least exaggerated now seemed to him natural and consolatory alexei alexandrovich had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor he was a believer who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis was in principle disagreeable to him he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine and with countess lidia ivanovna who had been carried away by it he had never argued but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure and did not inwardly oppose them 
 i am very very grateful to you both for your deeds and for your words he said when she had finished praying 
 countess lidia ivanovna once more squeezed both of her hands 
 now i will enter upon my duties she said with a smile after a pause as she wiped away the traces of tears i am going to seriozha only in the last extremity shall i apply to you and she got up and went out 
 countess lidia ivanovna went into part of the house and dropping tears on the scared cheeks she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead 
 countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexei household but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out and they were modified by kornei alexei valet who though no one was aware of the fact now managed household and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while the latter was dressing all it was necessary for him to know but lidia help was none the less real she gave alexei alexandrovich moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him and still more as it was soothing to her to believe by having almost turned him to christianity that is from an indifferent and apathetic believer she had turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine which had been gaining ground of late in peterburg it was easy for alexei alexandrovich to believe in this teaching alexei alexandrovich like lidia ivanovna indeed and others who shared their views was completely devoid of profundity of imagination that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the ideas evoked by the imagination become so actual that they must needs be in harmony with other ideas and with reality itself he saw nothing impossible and absurd in the idea that death though existing for unbelievers did not exist for him and that as he was possessed of the most perfect faith of the measure of which he was himself the judge there was therefore no sin in his soul and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth 
 it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexei alexandrovich and he knew that when without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart and that in signing official papers he was doing his will but for alexei alexandrovich it was a necessity to think in that way it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint however imaginary from which looked down upon by all he could look down on others that he clung as to his one salvation to his delusion of salvation

 the countess lidia ivanovna had as a very young and enthusiastic girl been married to a wealthy man of high rank a very jovial and extremely dissipated rake one month after marriage her husband abandoned her and her enthusiastic protestations of affection he met with an irony and even hostility which people knowing the good heart and seeing no defects in the enthusiastic lidia were at a loss to explain though they were divorced and lived apart yet whenever the husband met the wife he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony the cause of which was incomprehensible 
 countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone she was in love with several people at once both men and women she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family she had been in love with one archbishop one vicar and one parish priest she had been in love with one journalist three slavophils with komissarov with one minister one doctor one english missionary and karenin all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society but from the time that after trouble she had taken him under special protection from the time that she had set to work in household looking after his welfare she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing and that she was now genuinely in love and with no one but karenin the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings analyzing her feeling and comparing it with former passions she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the czar that she would not have been in love with if there had been no slavonic question but that she loved karenin for himself for his lofty uncomprehended soul for the sweet to her high notes of his voice for his drawling intonation his weary eyes his character and his soft white hands with their swollen veins she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him she tried to please him not by her words only but in her whole person for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before she caught herself in reveries on what might have been if she had not been married and he had been free she blushed with emotion when he came into the room she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her 
 for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement she had learned that anna and vronsky were in peterburg alexei alexandrovich must be saved from seeing her he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him and that he might meet her any minute 
 lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those shocking people as she called anna and vronsky intended doing and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he might not come across them the young adjutant a friend of vronsky through whom she obtained her information and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down when the next morning a note was brought her the handwriting of which she recognized with horror it was the handwriting of anna karenina the envelope was of paper as thick as bast on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram and the letter smelt of agreeable scent 
 who brought it 
 a commissionaire from the hotel 
 it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter her excitement brought on an attack of asthma to which she was subject when she had recovered her composure she read the following letter in french 
 madame la comtesse the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the i feel unpardonable boldness to write to you i am miserable at being separated from my son i entreat permission to see him once before my departure forgive me for recalling myself to your memory i apply to you and not to alexei alexandrovich simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me knowing your friendship for him i know you will understand me could you send seriozha to me or should i come to the house at some fixed hour or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home i do not anticipate a refusal knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests you cannot conceive the craving i have to see him and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me 
 
 anna 
 everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna its contents and the allusion to magnanimity and especially its free and easy as she considered tone 
 say that there is no answer said countess lidia ivanovna and immediately opening her blotting book she wrote to alexei alexandrovich that she hoped to see him at one at the levee 
 i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject there we will arrange where to meet best of all at my house where i will order tea as you like it urgent he lays the cross but he gives the strength to bear it she added so as to give him some slight preparation 
 countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexei alexandrovich she enjoyed that form of communication which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews

 countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone she was in love with several people at once both men and women she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family she had been in love with one archbishop one vicar and one parish priest she had been in love with one journalist three slavophils with komissarov with one minister one doctor one english missionary and karenin all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society but from the time that after trouble she had taken him under special protection from the time that she had set to work in household looking after his welfare she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing and that she was now genuinely in love and with no one but karenin the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings analyzing her feeling and comparing it with former passions she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the czar that she would not have been in love with if there had been no slavonic question but that she loved karenin for himself for his lofty uncomprehended soul for the sweet to her high notes of his voice for his drawling intonation his weary eyes his character and his soft white hands with their swollen veins she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him she tried to please him not by her words only but in her whole person for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before she caught herself in reveries on what might have been if she had not been married and he had been free she blushed with emotion when he came into the room she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her 
 for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement she had learned that anna and vronsky were in peterburg alexei alexandrovich must be saved from seeing her he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him and that he might meet her any minute 
 lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those shocking people as she called anna and vronsky intended doing and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he might not come across them the young adjutant a friend of vronsky through whom she obtained her information and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down when the next morning a note was brought her the handwriting of which she recognized with horror it was the handwriting of anna karenina the envelope was of paper as thick as bast on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram and the letter smelt of agreeable scent 
 who brought it 
 a commissionaire from the hotel 
 it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter her excitement brought on an attack of asthma to which she was subject when she had recovered her composure she read the following letter in french 
 madame la comtesse the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the i feel unpardonable boldness to write to you i am miserable at being separated from my son i entreat permission to see him once before my departure forgive me for recalling myself to your memory i apply to you and not to alexei alexandrovich simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me knowing your friendship for him i know you will understand me could you send seriozha to me or should i come to the house at some fixed hour or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home i do not anticipate a refusal knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests you cannot conceive the craving i have to see him and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me 
 
 anna 
 everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna its contents and the allusion to magnanimity and especially its free and easy as she considered tone 
 say that there is no answer said countess lidia ivanovna and immediately opening her blotting book she wrote to alexei alexandrovich that she hoped to see him at one at the levee 
 i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject there we will arrange where to meet best of all at my house where i will order tea as you like it urgent he lays the cross but he gives the strength to bear it she added so as to give him some slight preparation 
 countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexei alexandrovich she enjoyed that form of communication which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews

 chapter 
 
 the levee was drawing to a close people met as they were going away and gossiped of the latest news of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries 
 if only countess marya borissovna were minister of war and princess vatkovsky were commander in chief said a little old man in a uniform addressing a tall handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments 
 and if i were one of the adjutants said the maid of honor smiling 
 you have an appointment already over the ecclesiastical department and your karenin 
 good day prince said the little old man to a man who came up to him 
 what were you saying of karenin said the prince 
 he and putiatov have received the order of alexandre nevsky 
 i thought he had it already 
 no just look at him said the little old man pointing with his embroidered hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council pleased and happy as brass he added stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions 
 no looking older said the gentleman of the bedchamber 
 from overwork always drawing up projects nowadays he let a poor devil go nowadays till explained it all to him under heads 
 looking older did you say il fait des passions i believe countess lidia jealous now of his wife 
 oh come now please say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna 
 why is there any harm in her being in love with karenin 
 but is it true madame here 
 well not here in the palace but in peterburg i met her yesterday with alexei vronsky bras dessus bras dessous on the morskaia 
 un homme qui pas the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning but he stopped to make room bowing for a member of the imperial family to pass 
 thus people talked incessantly of alexei alexandrovich finding fault with him and laughing at him while he blocking up the way of the member of the imperial council he had captured was explaining to him point by point his new financial project never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape 
 almost at the same time that his wife left alexei alexandrovich there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop this full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it but alexei alexandrovich himself was not yet aware that his career was over whether it was due to his feud with stremov or his misfortune with his wife or simply that alexei alexandrovich had reached his predestined limits it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end he still filled a position of consequence he sat on many commissions and committees but he was a man whose day was over and from whom nothing was expected whatever he said whatever he proposed was heard as though it were something long familiar and the very thing that was not needed but alexei alexandrovich was not aware of this and on the contrary being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction shortly after his separation from his wife he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future 
 alexei alexandrovich did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world he was not merely free from anxiety on this head he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity 
 he that is married careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord says the apostle paul and alexei alexandrovich who was now guided in every action by scripture often recalled this text it seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife he had in these very projects of reform been serving the lord more zealously than ever 
 the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council trying to get away from him did not trouble alexei alexandrovich he gave up his exposition only when the member of the council seizing his chance when one of the imperial family was passing slipped away from him 
 left alone alexei alexandrovich looked down collecting his thoughts then looked casually about him and walked toward the door where he hoped to meet countess lidia ivanovna 
 and how strong they all are how sound physically thought alexei alexandrovich looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his perfumed whiskers and at the red neck of the prince pinched by his tight uniform he had to pass them on his way truly is it said that all the world is evil he thought with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber 
 moving forward deliberately alexei alexandrovich bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him and looking toward the door his eyes sought countess lidia ivanovna 
 ah alexei alexandrovich said the little old man with a malicious light in his eyes at the moment when karenin had come up to them and was nodding with a frigid gesture i congratulated you yet said the old man pointing to his newly received ribbon 
 thank you answered alexei alexandrovich what an exquisite day today he added laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word exquisite 
 that they laughed at him he was well aware but he did not expect anything but hostility from them he was used to that by now 
 catching sight of the yellow shoulders of lidia ivanovna jutting out above her corset and her fine pensive eyes summoning him to her alexei alexandrovich smiled revealing untarnished white teeth and went toward her 
 lidia dress had cost her great pains as indeed all her dresses had done of late her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of what she had pursued thirty years before then her desire had been to adorn herself with something and the more adorned the better now on the contrary she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling and as far as alexei alexandrovich was concerned she succeeded and was in his eyes attractive for him she was the one island not only of good will to him but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him 
 passing through rows of ironical eyes he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun 
 i congratulate you she said to him her eyes on his ribbon 
 suppressing a smile of pleasure he shrugged his shoulders closing his eyes as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him countess lidia ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction though he never admitted it 
 how is our angel said countess lidia ivanovna meaning seriozha 
 i say i was quite pleased with him said alexei alexandrovich raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes and sitnikov is not satisfied with him sitnikov was the tutor to whom secular education had been intrusted as i have mentioned to you a sort of coldness in him toward the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child alexei alexandrovich began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him outside the service the education of his son 
 when alexei alexandrovich with lidia help had been brought back anew to life and activity he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands having never before taken any interest in educational questions alexei alexandrovich devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject after reading several books on anthropology education and didactics alexei alexandrovich drew up a plan of education and engaging the best tutor in peterburg to superintend it he set to work and the subject continually absorbed him 
 yes but the heart i see in him his heart and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong said lidia ivanovna with enthusiasm 
 yes perhaps as for me i do my duty all i can do 
 coming to me said countess lidia ivanovna after a pause we have to speak of a subject painful for you i would give anything to have spared you certain memories but others are not of the same mind i have received a letter from her she is here in peterburg 
 alexei alexandrovich shuddered at the allusion to his wife but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter 
 i was expecting it he said 
 countess lidia ivanovna looked at him ecstatically and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes

 when alexei alexandrovich came into the countess lidia snug little boudoir decorated with old china and hung with portraits the lady herself had not yet made her appearance 
 she was changing her dress 
 a cloth was laid on a round table and on it stood a china tea service and a silver teakettle and spirit lamp alexei alexandrovich looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room and sitting down to the table he opened a new testament lying upon it the rustle of the silk skirt drew his attention off 
 well now we can sit quietly said countess lidia ivanovna slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa and talk over our tea 
 after some words of preparation countess lidia ivanovna breathing hard and flushing crimson gave into alexei hands the letter she had received 
 after reading the letter he sat a long while in silence 
 i think i have the right to refuse her he said timidly lifting his eyes 
 dear friend you never see evil in anyone 
 on the contrary i see that all is evil but whether it is just 
 his face showed irresolution and a seeking for counsel support and guidance in a matter he did not understand 
 no countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him there are limits to everything i can understand immorality she said not quite truthfully since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality but i understand cruelty to whom to you how can she stay in the town where you are no the longer one lives the more one learns and learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness 
 who is to cast a stone said alexei alexandrovich unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play i have forgiven all and so i cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her by her love for her son 
 but is that love my friend is it sincere admitting that you have forgiven that you forgive have we the right to work on the soul of that angel he looks on her as dead he prays for her and beseeches god to have mercy on her sins and it is better so but now what will he think 
 i had not thought of that said alexei alexandrovich evidently agreeing 
 countess lidia ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent she was praying 
 if you ask my advice she said having finished her prayer and uncovered her face i do not advise you to do this do you suppose i see how you are suffering how this has torn open your wounds but supposing that as always you think of yourself what can it lead to to fresh suffering for you to torture for the child if there were a trace of humanity left in her she ought not to wish it herself no i have no hesitation in saying i advise against it and if you will intrust it to me i will write to her 
 and alexei alexandrovich consented and countess lidia ivanovna sent the following letter in french 
 dear madame to be reminded of you might result in your asking questions which could not be answered without implanting in the soul a spirit of censure toward what should be for him sacred and therefore i beg you to interpret your refusal in the spirit of christian love i pray to almighty god to have mercy on you 
 
 countess lidia 
 this letter attained the secret object which countess lidia ivanovna had concealed from herself it wounded anna to the quick 
 for his part alexei alexandrovich on returning home from lidia could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late 
 the thought of his wife who had so greatly sinned against him and toward whom he had been so saintly as countess lidia ivanovna had so justly told him ought not to have troubled him but he was not easy he could not understand the book he was reading he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her of the mistake which as it now seemed he had made in regard to her the memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races especially his having insisted only on the observance of external decorum and not having sent a challenge tortured him like a remorse he was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her and most of all his forgiveness which nobody wanted and his care of the other child seared his heart with shame and remorse 
 and just the same feeling of shame and remorse he felt now as he reviewed all his past with her recalling the awkward words in which after long wavering he proposed to her 
 but how have i been to blame he said to himself and this question always excited another question in him whether they felt differently did their loving and marrying differently these vronskys and oblonskys these gentlemen of the bedchamber with their fine calves and there passed before his mind a whole series of these succulent vigorous men who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself he tried to dispel these thoughts he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life but for the life of eternity and that there was peace and love in his heart but the fact that he had in this transient trivial life made as it seemed to him a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence but this temptation did not last long and soon there was reestablished once more in alexei soul the peace and the loftiness by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember

 chapter 
 
 well kapitonich said seriozha coming back rosy and from his walk the day before his birthday and giving his russian plaited overcoat to the tall old hall porter who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure well has the bandaged official been here today did papa see him 
 he saw him the minute the head clerk came out i announced him said the hall porter with a wink here take it off 
 seriozha said his slavonic tutor stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms take it off yourself but seriozha though he heard the feeble voice did not pay attention to it he stood keeping hold of the hall shoulder knot and gazing into his face 
 well and did papa do what he wanted for him 
 the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively 
 the bandaged official who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexei alexandrovich interested both seriozha and the hall porter seriozha had come upon him in the hall and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face 
 since then seriozha having met him a second time in the hall took great interest in him 
 well was he very glad he asked 
 glad i should think so almost dancing as he walked away 
 and has anything been left for me asked seriozha after a pause 
 come sir said the hall porter then with a shake of his head he whispered something from the countess 
 seriozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday 
 you say where 
 kornei took it to your papa a fine plaything it must be too 
 how big like this 
 rather small but a fine thing 
 a book 
 else run along run along vassilii lukich is calling you said the porter hearing the steps approaching and carefully taking away from his shoulder knot the little hand in the glove off he indicated with his head lukich the tutor 
 vassilii lukich coming in one tiny minute answered seriozha with gay and loving smile which always won over the careful vassilii lukich 
 seriozha was too happy everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard from lidia niece during his walk in the public gardens this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the joy of the bandaged official and his own joy at toys having come for him it seemed to seriozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy 
 you know received the order of alexandre nevsky today 
 to be sure i do people have already been here to congratulate him 
 and is he glad 
 glad at the gracious favor i should think so a proof deserved it said the porter sternly and seriously

 on coming into the room seriozha instead of sitting down to his lessons told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a toy railway what do you think he inquired 
 but vassilii lukich was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher who was coming at two 
 no do just tell me vassilii lukich he asked suddenly when he was seated at their worktable with the book in his hands what is greater than the alexandre nevsky you know received the alexandre nevsky 
 vassilii lukich replied that the vladimir was greater than the alexandre nevsky 
 and higher still 
 well highest of all is the andrei pervozvanny 
 and higher than the andrei 
 i know 
 what you know and seriozha leaning on his elbows sank into deep meditation 
 his meditations were of the most complex and diverse character he imagined his having been suddenly presented with both the vladimir and the andrei today and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson and dreamed how when he was grown up he would himself receive all the orders and what might be invented higher than the andrei directly any higher order were invented he would win it they would make a higher one still and he would immediately win that too 
 the time passed in such meditations and when the teacher came the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready and the teacher was not only displeased but hurt this touched seriozha he felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson however much he tried he was utterly unable to do it as long as the teacher was explaining to him he believed him and seemed to comprehend but as soon as he was left alone he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher and he was anxious to comfort him 
 he chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book 
 mikhail ivanich when is your birthday he asked all of a sudden 
 much better be thinking about your work birthdays are of no importance to a rational being a day like any other on which one has to do work 
 seriozha looked intently at the teacher at his scanty beard at his spectacles which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him he knew that the teacher did not think what he had said he felt it from the tone in which it was said but why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff why does he keep me off why he love me he asked himself mournfully and could not think of an answer

 well kapitonich said seriozha coming back rosy and from his walk the day before his birthday and giving his russian plaited overcoat to the tall old hall porter who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure well has the bandaged official been here today did papa see him 
 he saw him the minute the head clerk came out i announced him said the hall porter with a wink here take it off 
 seriozha said his slavonic tutor stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms take it off yourself but seriozha though he heard the feeble voice did not pay attention to it he stood keeping hold of the hall shoulder knot and gazing into his face 
 well and did papa do what he wanted for him 
 the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively 
 the bandaged official who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexei alexandrovich interested both seriozha and the hall porter seriozha had come upon him in the hall and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face 
 since then seriozha having met him a second time in the hall took great interest in him 
 well was he very glad he asked 
 glad i should think so almost dancing as he walked away 
 and has anything been left for me asked seriozha after a pause 
 come sir said the hall porter then with a shake of his head he whispered something from the countess 
 seriozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday 
 you say where 
 kornei took it to your papa a fine plaything it must be too 
 how big like this 
 rather small but a fine thing 
 a book 
 else run along run along vassilii lukich is calling you said the porter hearing the steps approaching and carefully taking away from his shoulder knot the little hand in the glove off he indicated with his head lukich the tutor 
 vassilii lukich coming in one tiny minute answered seriozha with gay and loving smile which always won over the careful vassilii lukich 
 seriozha was too happy everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard from lidia niece during his walk in the public gardens this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the joy of the bandaged official and his own joy at toys having come for him it seemed to seriozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy 
 you know received the order of alexandre nevsky today 
 to be sure i do people have already been here to congratulate him 
 and is he glad 
 glad at the gracious favor i should think so a proof deserved it said the porter sternly and seriously 
 seriozha fell to musing gazing up at the face of the porter which he had thoroughly studied in every detail especially at his chin which hung down between the gray whiskers never seen by anyone but seriozha who saw him only from below 
 well and has your daughter been to see you lately 
 the daughter was a ballet dancer 
 when is she to come on weekdays their lessons to learn too and your lesson sir run along

 after the lesson with the teacher of grammar came his lesson while waiting for his father seriozha sat at the table playing with a penknife and fell to musing among favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks he did not believe in death generally and in her death in particular in spite of what lidia ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed and it was just because of that and after he had been told she was dead that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk every woman of full graceful figure with dark hair was his mother at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness stirred within him that his breath failed him and tears came into his eyes and he was on tiptoe with expectation that she would come up to him would lift her veil all her face would be visible she would smile she would hug him he would sniff her fragrance feel the softness of her arms and cry with happiness just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him and he laughed and bit her white fingers later when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead and his father and lidia ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked which he could not possibly believe because he loved her he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way that day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil whom he had watched with a throbbing heart believing it to be her as she came toward them along the path the lady had not come up to them but had disappeared somewhere that day more intensely than ever seriozha felt a rush of love for her and now waiting for his father he forgot everything and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and thinking of her 
 here is your papa vassilii lukich diverted him 
 seriozha jumped up and went up to his father and kissing his hand looked at him intently trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the alexandre nevsky 
 did you have a good walk said alexei alexandrovich sitting down in his easy chair pulling the volume of the old testament to him and opening it although alexei alexandrovich had more than once told seriozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly he often referred to the bible himself during the lesson and seriozha observed this 
 yes it was very good indeed papa said seriozha sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it which was forbidden i saw nadinka nadinka was a niece of lidia who was being brought up in her house she told me been given a new star are you glad papa 
 first of all rock your chair please said alexei alexandrovich and secondly not the reward precious but the work itself and i could have wished you had understood that if you now are going to work to study in order to win a reward then the work will seem hard to you but when you work alexei alexandrovich as he spoke thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers loving your work you will find your reward for it 
 eyes hitherto shining with gaiety and tenderness grew dull and dropped before his gaze this was the same tone his father always took with him and seriozha had learned by now to fall in with it his father always talked to him so seriozha felt as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination one of those boys who exist in books utterly unlike himself and seriozha always tried before his father to pretend being this storybook boy 
 you understand that i hope said his father 
 yes papa answered seriozha acting the part of the imaginary boy 
 the lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the evangel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament the verses from the evangel seriozha knew fairly well but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding bony knobbiness of his forehead that he lost the thread and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another it was evident to alexei alexandrovich that he did not understand what he was saying and this irritated him 
 he frowned and began explaining what seriozha had heard many times before and never could remember because he understood it too well just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action seriozha looked with scared eyes at his father and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said as he sometimes did and this thought so alarmed seriozha that he now understood nothing but his father did not make him repeat it and passed on to the lesson out of the old testament seriozha recounted the events themselves well enough but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured he knew nothing though he had already been punished over this lesson the passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair was where he had to tell of the patriarchs before the flood he did not know one of them except enoch who had been taken up alive to heaven last time he had remembered their names but now he had forgotten them utterly chiefly because enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the old testament and translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his watch chain and a button on his waistcoat 
 in death of which they talked to him so often seriozha disbelieved entirely he did not believe that those he loved could die above all that he himself would die that was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible but he had been told all men die he had asked people indeed whom he trusted and they too had confirmed it his old nurse too said the same though reluctantly but enoch had not died and so it followed that everyone did not die and why cannot anyone else so serve god and be taken alive to heaven thought seriozha bad people that is those seriozha did not like might die but the good might all be like enoch 
 well what are the names of the patriarchs 
 enoch enos 
 but you have said that already this is bad seriozha very bad if you try to learn what is most necessary of all for a christian said his father getting up whatever can interest you i am displeased with you and piotr ignatich this was the chief pedagogue is displeased with you i shall have to punish you 
 his father and his teacher were both displeased with seriozha and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy on the contrary he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seriozha in his opinion he did not want to learn what he was taught in reality he could not learn that he could not because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him that those claims his father and his teacher made upon him those claims were in opposition and he was in direct conflict with his governors 
 he was nine years old he was a child but he knew his own soul it was precious to him he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye and without the key of love he let no one into his soul his teachers complained that he would not learn while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge and he learned from kapitonich from his nurse from nadinka from vassilii lukich but not from his teachers the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long oozed at another place and its waters did their work there 
 his father punished seriozha by not letting him go to see nadinka lidia niece but this punishment turned out happily for seriozha vassilii lukich was in a good humor and showed him how to make windmills the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the wings or tying himself on and whirling round of his mother seriozha did not think all the evening but when he had gone to bed he suddenly remembered her and prayed in his own words that tomorrow his mother in time for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him 
 vassilii lukich do you know what i prayed for tonight extra beside the regular things 
 that you might learn your lessons better 
 no 
 toys 
 no never guess a splendid thing but a secret when it comes to pass tell you you guess 
 no i guess you tell me said vassilii lukich with a smile which was rare with him come lie down putting out the candle 
 without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for there i was almost telling the secret said seriozha laughing gaily 
 when the candle was taken away seriozha heard his mother and felt her presence she stood over him and her loving gaze caressed him but then came windmills a penknife everything became confused and he fell asleep

 chapter 
 
 on arriving in peterburg vronsky and anna stayed at one of the best hotels vronsky apart in a lower story anna above with her child its nurse and her maid in a large suite of four rooms 
 on the day of his arrival vronsky went to his there he found his mother who had come from moscow on business his mother and greeted him as usual they asked him about his stay abroad and talked of their common acquaintances but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna his brother came next morning to see vronsky and of his own accord asked him about her and alexei vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage that he hoped to arrange a divorce and then to marry her and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so 
 if the world disapproves i care said vronsky but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me they will have to be on the same terms with my wife 
 the elder brother who had always a respect for his younger judgment could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question for his part he had nothing against it and with alexei he went up to see anna 
 before his brother as before everyone vronsky addressed anna with a certain formality treating her as he might a very intimate friend but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations and they talked about going to estate 
 in spite of all his social experience vronsky was in consequence of the new position in which he was placed laboring under a strange misapprehension one would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and anna but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in days and that now with the rapidity of modern progress he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress the views of society had changed and that the question of their reception by society was far from decided of course he thought she would not be received at court but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light 
 one may sit for several hours at a stretch with legs crossed in the same position if one knows that nothing to prevent changing position but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs then cramps come on the legs begin to twitch and to strain toward the spot to which one would like to draw them this was what vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them but he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally it was closed for anna just as in the game of cat and mouse the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for anna 
 one of the first ladies of peterburg society whom vronsky saw was his cousin betsy 
 at last she greeted him joyfully and anna how glad i am where are you stopping i can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor peterburg horrid i can fancy your honeymoon in rome how about the divorce is that all over 
 vronsky noticed that enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place 
 people will cast a stone at me i know she said but i shall come and see anna yes i shall certainly come you be here long i suppose 
 and she did certainly come to see anna the same day but her tone was not at all the same as in former days she unmistakably prided herself on her courage and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship she only stayed ten minutes talking of society news and on leaving she said 
 never told me when the divorce is to be supposing ready to fling my cap over the mill other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until married and so simple nowadays ca se fait so going on friday sorry we see each other again 
 from tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world but he made another effort in his own family his mother he did not reckon upon he knew that his mother who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her career but he had more hope of varia his wife he fancied she would not cast a stone and would go simply and directly to see anna and would receive her in her own house 
 the day after his arrival vronsky went to her and finding her alone expressed his wishes directly 
 you know alexei she said after hearing him how fond i am of you and how ready i am to do anything for you but i have not spoken because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna she said articulating the name anna arkadyevna with particular care suppose please that i judge her never perhaps in her place i should have done the same i and enter into that she said glancing timidly at his gloomy face but one must call things by their names you want me to go and see her to ask her here and to rehabilitate her in society but do understand that i cannot do so i have daughters growing up and i must live in the world for my sake well ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that i ask her here or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently that would offend her i raise her 
 oh i regard her as having fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily and he got up in silence understanding that his decision was not to be shaken 
 alexei be angry with me please understand that not to blame began varia looking at him with a timid smile 
 not angry with you he said still as gloomily but this is doubly painful to me sorry too that this means breaking up our friendship if not breaking up at least weakening it you will understand that for me too it cannot be otherwise 
 and with that he left her 
 vronsky knew that further efforts were useless and that he had to spend these few days in peterburg as though in a strange town avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him one of the most unpleasant features of his position in peterburg was that alexei alexandrovich and his name seemed to meet him everywhere he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexei alexandrovich he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him so at least it seemed to vronsky just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually as though on purpose grazing his sore finger against everything 
 their stay in peterburg was the more painful to vronsky because he perceived all the time a sort of new mood he could not understand in anna at one time she would seem in love with him and the next she would become cold irritable and impenetrable she was worrying over something and keeping something back from him and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence and which for her with her delicate intuition must have been still more unbearable

 and she did certainly come to see anna the same day but her tone was not at all the same as in former days she unmistakably prided herself on her courage and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship she only stayed ten minutes talking of society news and on leaving she said 
 never told me when the divorce is to be supposing ready to fling my cap over the mill other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until married and so simple nowadays ca se fait so going on friday sorry we see each other again 
 from tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world but he made another effort in his own family his mother he did not reckon upon he knew that his mother who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her career but he had more hope of varia his wife he fancied she would not cast a stone and would go simply and directly to see anna and would receive her in her own house 
 the day after his arrival vronsky went to her and finding her alone expressed his wishes directly 
 you know alexei she said after hearing him how fond i am of you and how ready i am to do anything for you but i have not spoken because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna she said articulating the name anna arkadyevna with particular care suppose please that i judge her never perhaps in her place i should have done the same i and enter into that she said glancing timidly at his gloomy face but one must call things by their names you want me to go and see her to ask her here and to rehabilitate her in society but do understand that i cannot do so i have daughters growing up and i must live in the world for my sake well ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that i ask her here or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently that would offend her i raise her 
 oh i regard her as having fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily and he got up in silence understanding that his decision was not to be shaken 
 alexei be angry with me please understand that not to blame began varia looking at him with a timid smile 
 not angry with you he said still as gloomily but this is doubly painful to me sorry too that this means breaking up our friendship if not breaking up at least weakening it you will understand that for me too it cannot be otherwise 
 and with that he left her 
 vronsky knew that further efforts were useless and that he had to spend these few days in peterburg as though in a strange town avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him one of the most unpleasant features of his position in peterburg was that alexei alexandrovich and his name seemed to meet him everywhere he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexei alexandrovich he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him so at least it seemed to vronsky just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually as though on purpose grazing his sore finger against everything 
 their stay in peterburg was the more painful to vronsky because he perceived all the time a sort of new mood he could not understand in anna at one time she would seem in love with him and the next she would become cold irritable and impenetrable she was worrying over something and keeping something back from him and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence and which for her with her delicate intuition must have been still more unbearable

 one of objects in coming back to russia had been to see her son from the day she left italy the thought of seeing him had never ceased to agitate her and as she got nearer to peterburg the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination she did not even put to herself the problem of how to arrange it it seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him but on her arrival in peterburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter 
 she had now been two days in peterburg the thought of her son never left her for a single instant but she had not yet seen him to go straight to the house where she might meet alexei alexandrovich that she felt she had no right to do she might be refused admittance and insulted to write and so enter into relations with her husband the thought of doing that made her miserable she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband to get a glimpse of her son out walking finding out where and when he went out was not enough for her she had so looked forward to this meeting she had so much she must say to him she so longed to embrace him to kiss him old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do but the nurse was not now living in alexei house in this uncertainty and in efforts to find the nurse two days had slipped by 
 hearing of the close intimacy between alexei alexandrovich and countess lidia ivanovna anna decided on the third day to write her a letter which cost her great pains and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her magnanimity she knew that if the letter were shown to her husband he would keep up his role of magnanimity and would not refuse her request 
 the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer that there was no answer she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when sending for commissionaire she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited and how afterward he had been told there was no answer anna felt humiliated insulted but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right her suffering was the more poignant since she had to bear it in solitude she could not and would not share it with vronsky she knew that to him although he was the primary cause of her distress the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence she knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him and she dreaded that more than anything in the world and so she hid from him everything that related to her son 
 spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son and had reached a decision to write to her husband she was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from lidia ivanovna the silence had subdued and depressed her but the letter all that she read between the lines in it so exasperated her this malice was so revolting beside her passionate legitimate tenderness for her son that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself 
 this coldness is simulation of feeling she said to herself they must needs insult me and torture the child and i am to submit to it not on any consideration she is worse than i am i lie anyway and she decided on the spot that next day birthday she would go straight to her house bribe the servants deceive the people but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child 
 she went to a toyshop bought toys and thought over a plan of action she would go early in the morning at eight when alexei alexandrovich would be certain not to be up she would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman so that they should let her in and without raising her veil she would say that she had come from godfather to congratulate him and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside she had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son often she dreamed of it she could never think of anything 
 the next day at eight in the morning anna got out of a hired coach and rang at the front entrance of her former home 
 run and see wanted some lady said kapitonich who not yet dressed in his overcoat and galoshes had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door his assistant a lad anna did not know had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in and pulling a note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand 
 seriozha sergei alexeich she said and was going on scrutinizing the note the assistant stopped her at the second glass door 
 whom do you want he asked 
 she did not hear his words and made no answer 
 noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady kapitonich went out to her opened the second door for her and asked her what she was pleased to want 
 from prince skorodumov for sergei alexeich she said 
 not up yet said the porter looking at her attentively 
 anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart and for a moment she forgot what she was here for 
 would you kindly wait said kapitonich taking off her fur cloak 
 as he took off the cloak kapitonich glanced at her face recognized her and made her a low bow in silence 
 please walk in your excellency he said to her 
 she tried to say something but her voice refused to utter any sound with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light swift steps up the stairs bent double and his galoshes catching in the steps kapitonich ran after her trying to overtake her 
 the there maybe not dressed let him know 
 anna still mounted the familiar staircase not understanding what the old man was saying 
 this way to the left if you please excuse its not being tidy in the former smoking room now the hall porter said panting excuse me wait a little your excellency just see he said and overtaking her he opened the high door and disappeared behind it anna stood still waiting only just awake said the hall porter coming out 
 and at the very instant the porter said this anna caught the sound of a childish yawn from the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes 
 let me in go away she said and went in through the high doorway on the right of the door stood a bed and sitting up in the bed was the boy his little body bent forward his nightshirt unbuttoned he was stretching and still yawning the instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again 
 seriozha she whispered walking noiselessly up to him 
 when she was parted from him and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him she had pictured him as he was at four years old when she had loved him most of all now he was not even the same as when she had left him he was farther than ever from the baby more grown and thinner how thin his face was how short his hair was what long hands how he had changed since she left him but it was he with his head his lips his soft neck and broad little shoulders 
 seriozha she repeated in the very ear 
 he raised himself again on his elbow turned his tousled head from side to side as though looking for something and opened his eyes quietly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him then all at once he smiled a blissful smile and shutting his eyes again rolled not backward but toward her into her arms 
 seriozha my darling boy she said breathing hard and putting her arms around his plump little body 
 mother he said wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him 
 smiling sleepily still with closed eyes he flung his fat little arms round her shoulders rolled toward her with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders 
 i knew he said opening his eyes my birthday today i knew come get up directly 
 and saying that he dropped asleep 
 anna looked at him hungrily she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence she knew and did not know the bare legs so long now that were thrust out below the quilt she knew those curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him she touched all this and could say nothing tears choked her 
 what are you crying for mother he said waking up completely mother what are you crying for he cried in a tearful voice 
 i i cry crying for joy so long since seen you i i she said gulping down her tears and turning away come time for you to dress now she added after a pause and never letting go his hands she sat down by his bedside on the chair where his clothes were put ready for him 
 how do you dress without me how she made an attempt to talk simply and cheerfully but she could not and again she turned away 
 i have a cold bath papa order it and not seen vassilii lukich come in soon why sitting on my clothes 
 and seriozha went off into a peal of laughter she looked at him and smiled 
 mother darling sweet one he shouted flinging himself on her again and hugging her it was as if only now on seeing her smile he fully grasped what had happened i want that on he said taking off her hat and as it were seeing her afresh without her hat he fell to kissing her again 
 but what did you think about me you think i was dead 
 i never believed it 
 you believe it my sweet 
 i knew i knew he repeated his favorite phrase and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it

 the mother held him away from her to see whether he was thinking what he said to her and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father but as it were asking her what he ought to think about his father 
 seriozha my darling she said love him better and kinder than i am and i have done him wrong when you grow up you will judge

 although she had just said he was better and kinder than she in the rapid glance she flung at him taking in his whole figure in all its details feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy for her son took possession of her with a swift gesture she put down her veil and quickening her pace almost ran out of the room

 intensely as anna had longed to see her son and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply on getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there yes all over and i am again alone she said to herself and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows she tried to think 
 the french maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress she gazed at her wonderingly and said later on a footman offered her coffee later on she said 
 the italian nurse after taking the baby out in her best came in with her and brought her to anna the plump little baby on seeing her mother as she always did held out her chubby little hands and with a smile on her toothless mouth began like a fish with a float bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered pinafore making them rustle it was impossible not to smile not to kiss the baby impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch crowing and prancing all over impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss and all this anna did and took her in her arms and made her dance and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for seriozha everything in this baby was charming but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart on her first child though the child of an unloved father had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child besides in the little girl everything was still in the future while seriozha was by now almost a personality and a personality dearly loved in him there was a conflict of thoughts and of feelings he understood her he loved her he judged her she thought recalling his words and his eyes and she was forever not physically only but spiritually divided from him and it was impossible to set this right 
 she gave the baby back to the nurse let her go and opened the locket in which there was portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl she got up and taking off her hat took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages she wanted to compare them and began taking them out of the album she took them all out except one the latest and best photograph in it he was in a white smock sitting astride a chair with frowning eyes and smiling lips it was his best most singular expression with her little supple hands her white delicate fingers that moved with a peculiar intensity today she pulled at a corner of the photograph but the photograph had caught somewhere and she could not get it out there was no paper knife on the table and pulling out the photograph that was next to her it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair she used it to push out her photograph oh here he is she said glancing at the portrait of vronsky and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery she had not once thought of him all the morning but now coming all at once upon that manly noble face so familiar and so dear to her she felt a sudden rush of love for him 
 but where is he how is it he leaves me alone in my misery she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son she sent to ask him to come to her immediately with a throbbing heart she awaited him rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all and the expressions of love with which he would console her the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him but that he would come immediately and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince iashvin who had just arrived in peterburg not coming alone and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me she thought not coming so that i could tell him everything but coming with iashvin and all at once a strange idea came to her what if he had ceased to love her 
 and going over the events of the last few days it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms at peterburg and that even now he was not coming to her alone as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face 
 but he ought to tell me so i must know that it is so if i knew it then know what i should do she said to herself utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her she thought he had ceased to love her she felt close upon despair and consequently she felt exceptionally alert she rang for her maid and went to her dressing room as she dressed she took more care over her appearance than she had done all these days as though he might if he had grown cold to her fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her 
 she heard the bell ring before she was ready 
 when she went into the drawing room it was not he but iashvin who met her eyes vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son which she had forgotten on the table and he made no haste to look round at her 
 we have met already she said putting her little hand into the huge hand of iashvin whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face we met last year at the races give them to me she said with a rapid movement snatching from vronsky the photographs of her son and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes were the races good this year instead of them i saw the races in the corso in rome but you care for life abroad she said with a cordial smile i know you and all your tastes though i have seen so little of you 
 awfully sorry for that for my tastes are mostly bad said iashvin gnawing at his left mustache 
 having talked a little while and noticing that vronsky glanced at the clock iashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in peterburg and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap 
 not long i think she said hesitatingly glancing at vronsky 
 so then we meet again said iashvin getting up and turning to vronsky where do you have your dinner 
 come and dine with me said anna resolutely angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person the dinner here is not good but at least you will see him there is no one of his old friends in the regiment alexei cares for as he does for you 
 delighted said iashvin with a smile from which vronsky could see that he liked anna very much 
 iashvin said and went away vronsky stayed behind 
 are you going too she said to him 
 late already he answered run along catch up in a moment he called to iashvin 
 she took him by the hand and without taking her eyes off him gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him 
 wait a minute something i want to say to you and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck oh was it right my asking him to dinner 
 you did quite right he said with a serene smile that showed his close teeth and he kissed her hand 
 alexei you have not changed to me she said pressing his hand in both of hers alexei i am miserable here when are we going away 
 soon soon you believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too he said and he drew away his hand 
 well go go she said offended and she walked quickly away from him

 when vronsky returned home anna was not yet home soon after he had left some lady so they told him had come to see her and she had gone out with her that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going that she had not yet come back and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before iashvin almost snatched her photographs out of his hands made him serious he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her and he waited for her in her drawing room but anna did not return alone but brought with her her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaia this was the lady who had come in the morning and with whom anna had gone out shopping anna appeared not to notice worried and inquiring expression and began a lively account of her shopping he saw that there was something working within her in her flashing eyes when they rested for a moment on him there was an intense concentration and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy had so fascinated him but which now so disturbed and alarmed him 
 the dinner was laid for four all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevich made his appearance with a message from princess betsy princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say she had been indisposed but begged anna to come to her between six and eight vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one but anna appeared not to notice it 
 very sorry that i come just between six and nine she said with a faint smile 
 the princess will be very sorry 
 and so shall i 
 going no doubt to hear patti said tushkevich 
 patti you give me an idea i would go if it were possible to get a box 
 i can get one tushkevich offered his services 
 i should be very very grateful to you said anna but you dine with us 
 vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about what had she brought the old princess oblonskaia home for what had she made tushkevich stay to dinner for and most amazing of all why was she sending him for a box could she possibly think in her position of going to benefit where all the circle of her acquaintances would be he looked at her with serious eyes but she responded with that defiant look the meaning of which he could not comprehend at dinner anna was in aggressively high spirits she almost flirted both with tushkevich and with iashvin when they got up from dinner and tushkevich had gone to get a box at the opera iashvin went to smoke and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs anna was already dressed in a gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris and with costly white lace on her head framing her face and particularly becoming showing up her dazzling beauty 
 are you really going to the theater he said trying not to look at her 
 why do you ask with such alarm she said wounded again at his not looking at her why i go 
 she appeared not to understand the meaning of his words 
 oh of course no reason whatever he said frowning 
 just what i say she said willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone and quietly turning back her long perfumed glove 
 anna for sake what is the matter with you he said watching her exactly as once her husband had done 
 i understand what you are asking 
 you know that out of the question to go 
 why so not going alone princess varvara has gone to dress she is going with me 
 he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair 
 but do you mean to say you know he began 
 but i care to know she almost shrieked i care to do i regret what i have done no no no if it were all to do again from the beginning it would be the same for us for you and for me there is only one thing that matters whether we love each other other people we need not consider why are we living here apart and not seeing each other why i go i love you and i care for anything she said in russian glancing at him with a peculiar obscure for him gleam in her eyes if you have not changed to me why you look at me 
 he looked at her he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress always so becoming to her but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him 
 my feeling cannot change you know but i beg you i entreat you he said again in french with a note of tender supplication in his voice but with coldness in his eyes 
 she did not hear his words but she saw the coldness of his eyes and answered with irritation 
 and i beg you to explain why i should not go 
 because it might cause you he hesitated 
 i understand iashvin compromettant and princess varvara is no worse than others oh here she is

 when vronsky returned home anna was not yet home soon after he had left some lady so they told him had come to see her and she had gone out with her that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going that she had not yet come back and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before iashvin almost snatched her photographs out of his hands made him serious he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her and he waited for her in her drawing room but anna did not return alone but brought with her her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaia this was the lady who had come in the morning and with whom anna had gone out shopping anna appeared not to notice worried and inquiring expression and began a lively account of her shopping he saw that there was something working within her in her flashing eyes when they rested for a moment on him there was an intense concentration and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy had so fascinated him but which now so disturbed and alarmed him

 chapter 
 
 vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna almost a hatred for her intentional refusal to understand her own position this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger if he had told her directly what he was thinking he would have said in that dress with a princess only too well known to everyone to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman but is flinging down a challenge to society that is to say cutting yourself off from it forever 
 he could not say that to her but how can she fail to see it and what is going on within her he said to himself he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified 
 he went back scowling to his rooms and sitting down beside iashvin who with his long legs stretched out on a chair was drinking cognac and seltzer water he ordered a glass of the same for himself 
 you were talking of powerful a fine horse and i would advise you to buy him said iashvin glancing at his gloomy face his hindquarters quite but the legs and head one wish for anything better 
 i think i will take him answered vronsky 
 their conversation about horses interested him but he did not for an instant forget anna and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece 
 anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater 
 iashvin tipping another glass of cognac into the bubbling water drank it and got up buttoning his coat 
 well go he said faintly smiling under his mustache and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of gloominess and did not attach any significance to it 
 not going vronsky answered gloomily 
 well i must i promised to then if you do come to the stalls you can take stall added iashvin as he went out 
 no busy 
 a wife is a care but worse when not a wife thought iashvin as he walked out of the hotel 
 vronsky left alone got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room 
 and today the fourth series iegor and his wife are there and my mother most likely of course all there now gone in taken off her cloak and come into the glare tushkevich iashvin princess varvara he pictured them to himself what about me either that frightened or have given up to tushkevich the right to protect her from every point of view stupid stupid and why is she putting me in such a position he said with a gesture of despair 
 with that gesture he knocked against the table on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of cognac and almost upset it he tried to catch it let it slip and angrily kicked the table over and rang 
 if you care to be in my service he said to the valet who came in you had better remember your duties this be here you ought to have cleared away 
 the valet conscious of his own innocence would have defended himself but glancing at his master he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent and hurriedly threading his way in and out dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles 
 not your duty send the waiter to clear away and get my dress coat out 
 vronsky arrived at the theater at eight the performance was in full swing the little old boxkeeper recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat called him your excellency and suggested he should not take a check but should simply call fiodor in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box opener and two footmen with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase the door opened to let the box opener slip through and the phrase drawing to the end reached hearing clearly but the doors were closed again at once and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over when he entered the hall brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets the noise was still going on on the stage the singer bowing and smiling flashing with bare shoulders and with diamonds was with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm gathering up the bouquets that were clumsily flying over the footlights then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the middle who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement craning forward shouting and clapping the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering and straightened his white tie vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls and standing still began looking about him that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar habitual surroundings the stage the noise all the familiar uninteresting particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater 
 there were as always the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes the same gaily dressed women god knows who and uniforms and black coats the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery and among the crowd in the boxes and in the front rows were some forty of the real people men and women and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention and with them he entered at once into relation 
 the act was over when he went in and so he did not go straight to his box but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpukhovskoy who standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him smiling 
 vronsky had not yet seen anna he purposely avoided looking in her direction but he knew by the direction of eyes where she was he looked round discreetly but he was not seeking her expecting the worst his eyes sought for alexei alexandrovich to his relief alexei alexandrovich was not in the theater that evening 
 how little of the military man there is left in you serpukhovskoy was saying to him a diplomat an artist something of that sort one would say 
 yes it was like going back home when i put on a dress coat answered vronsky smiling and slowly taking out his opera glasses 
 well own i envy you there when i come back from abroad and put on this he touched his shoulder knot i regret my freedom 
 serpukhovskoy had long given up all hope of career but he liked him as before and was now particularly cordial to him 
 what a pity you were not in time for the first act 
 vronsky listening with half an ear moved his opera glasses from the stalls and scanned the boxes near a lady in a turban and a bald old man who seemed to blink angrily in the moving opera glasses vronsky suddenly caught sight of head proud strikingly beautiful and smiling in its frame of lace she was in the fifth box twenty paces from him she was sitting in front and slightly turning was saying something to iashvin the setting of her head on her handsome broad shoulders and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow but he felt utterly different toward her beauty now in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery and so her beauty though it attracted him even more intensely than before gave him now a sense of injury she was not looking in his direction but vronsky felt that she had seen him already 
 when vronsky turned the opera glasses again in that direction he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box anna folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet was gazing away and did not see and obviously did not wish to see what was taking place in the next box face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards scowling he sucked the left tip of his mustache further and further into his mouth and cast sidelong glances at the next box 
 in that box on the left were the kartassovs vronsky knew them and knew that anna was acquainted with them madame kartassova a thin little woman was standing up in her box and her back turned upon anna she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her her face was pale and angry and she was talking excitedly kartassov a fat bald man was continually looking round at anna while he attempted to soothe his wife when the wife had gone out the husband lingered a long while and tried to catch eye obviously anxious to bow to her but anna with unmistakable intention avoided noticing him and talked to iashvin whose cropped head was bent down to her kartassov went out without making his salutation and the box was left empty 
 vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartassovs and anna but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened he knew this both from what he had seen and most of all from the face of anna who he could see was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful anyone who did not know her and her circle who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration indignation and amazement that she should show herself in society and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks 
 knowing that something had happened but not knowing precisely what vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety and hoping to find out something he went toward his box purposely choosing the way round farthest from box he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances vronsky heard the name of karenin and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name with a meaning glance at his companions 
 ah vronsky when are you coming to the regiment we let you off without a supper our one of the most thorough said the colonel of his regiment 
 i stop awfully sorry another time said vronsky and he ran upstairs toward his box 
 the old countess mother with her curls was in his box varia with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor 
 leaving the princess sorokina with her mother varia held out her hand to her and began immediately to speak of what interested him she was more excited than he had ever seen her 
 i think mean and hateful and madame kartassova had no right to do it madame karenina she began 
 but what is it i know 
 what you heard 
 you know i should be the last person to hear of it 
 there a more spiteful creature than that madame kartassova 
 but what did she do 
 my husband told me she has insulted madame karenina her husband began talking to her across the box and madame kartassova made a scene she said something aloud they say something insulting and went away 
 count your maman is asking for you said the young princess sorokina peeping out of the door of the box 
 been expecting you all the while said his mother smiling sarcastically you were nowhere to be seen 
 her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight

 vronsky made no reply and saying a few words to princess sorokina he went away at the door he met his brother 
 ah alexei said his brother how disgusting idiot of a woman nothing else i wanted to go straight to her go together 
 vronsky did not hear him with rapid steps he went downstairs he felt that he must do something but he did not know what anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position together with pity for her suffering filled his heart he went down and made straight for box at her box stood stremov talking to her 
 there are no more tenors le moule en est brise 
 vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov

 noticing in the next act that her box was empty vronsky rousing many an indignant hush in the silent audience went out in the middle of a solo and drove home 
 anna was already at home when vronsky went up to her she was in the same dress she had worn at the theater she was sitting in the first armchair against the wall looking straight before her she looked at him and at once resumed her former position 
 anna he said

 he was sorry for her and angry notwithstanding he assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her and he did not reproach her in words but in his heart he reproached her 
 and the asseverations of his love which seemed to him so trivial that he was ashamed to utter them she drank in eagerly and gradually became calmer the next day completely reconciled they left for the country

 part five 
 chapter 
 
 vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna almost a hatred for her intentional refusal to understand her own position this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger if he had told her directly what he was thinking he would have said in that dress with a princess only too well known to everyone to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman but is flinging down a challenge to society that is to say cutting yourself off from it forever 
 he could not say that to her but how can she fail to see it and what is going on within her he said to himself he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified 
 he went back scowling to his rooms and sitting down beside iashvin who with his long legs stretched out on a chair was drinking cognac and seltzer water he ordered a glass of the same for himself 
 you were talking of powerful a fine horse and i would advise you to buy him said iashvin glancing at his gloomy face his hindquarters quite but the legs and head one wish for anything better 
 i think i will take him answered vronsky 
 their conversation about horses interested him but he did not for an instant forget anna and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece 
 anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater 
 iashvin tipping another glass of cognac into the bubbling water drank it and got up buttoning his coat 
 well go he said faintly smiling under his mustache and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of gloominess and did not attach any significance to it 
 not going vronsky answered gloomily 
 well i must i promised to then if you do come to the stalls you can take stall added iashvin as he went out 
 no busy 
 a wife is a care but worse when not a wife thought iashvin as he walked out of the hotel 
 vronsky left alone got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room 
 and today the fourth series iegor and his wife are there and my mother most likely of course all there now gone in taken off her cloak and come into the glare tushkevich iashvin princess varvara he pictured them to himself what about me either that frightened or have given up to tushkevich the right to protect her from every point of view stupid stupid and why is she putting me in such a position he said with a gesture of despair 
 with that gesture he knocked against the table on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of cognac and almost upset it he tried to catch it let it slip and angrily kicked the table over and rang 
 if you care to be in my service he said to the valet who came in you had better remember your duties this be here you ought to have cleared away 
 the valet conscious of his own innocence would have defended himself but glancing at his master he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent and hurriedly threading his way in and out dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles 
 not your duty send the waiter to clear away and get my dress coat out 
 vronsky arrived at the theater at eight the performance was in full swing the little old boxkeeper recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat called him your excellency and suggested he should not take a check but should simply call fiodor in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box opener and two footmen with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase the door opened to let the box opener slip through and the phrase drawing to the end reached hearing clearly but the doors were closed again at once and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over when he entered the hall brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets the noise was still going on on the stage the singer bowing and smiling flashing with bare shoulders and with diamonds was with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm gathering up the bouquets that were clumsily flying over the footlights then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the middle who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement craning forward shouting and clapping the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering and straightened his white tie vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls and standing still began looking about him that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar habitual surroundings the stage the noise all the familiar uninteresting particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater 
 there were as always the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes the same gaily dressed women god knows who and uniforms and black coats the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery and among the crowd in the boxes and in the front rows were some forty of the real people men and women and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention and with them he entered at once into relation 
 the act was over when he went in and so he did not go straight to his box but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpukhovskoy who standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him smiling 
 vronsky had not yet seen anna he purposely avoided looking in her direction but he knew by the direction of eyes where she was he looked round discreetly but he was not seeking her expecting the worst his eyes sought for alexei alexandrovich to his relief alexei alexandrovich was not in the theater that evening 
 how little of the military man there is left in you serpukhovskoy was saying to him a diplomat an artist something of that sort one would say 
 yes it was like going back home when i put on a dress coat answered vronsky smiling and slowly taking out his opera glasses 
 well own i envy you there when i come back from abroad and put on this he touched his shoulder knot i regret my freedom 
 serpukhovskoy had long given up all hope of career but he liked him as before and was now particularly cordial to him 
 what a pity you were not in time for the first act 
 vronsky listening with half an ear moved his opera glasses from the stalls and scanned the boxes near a lady in a turban and a bald old man who seemed to blink angrily in the moving opera glasses vronsky suddenly caught sight of head proud strikingly beautiful and smiling in its frame of lace she was in the fifth box twenty paces from him she was sitting in front and slightly turning was saying something to iashvin the setting of her head on her handsome broad shoulders and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow but he felt utterly different toward her beauty now in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery and so her beauty though it attracted him even more intensely than before gave him now a sense of injury she was not looking in his direction but vronsky felt that she had seen him already 
 when vronsky turned the opera glasses again in that direction he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box anna folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet was gazing away and did not see and obviously did not wish to see what was taking place in the next box face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards scowling he sucked the left tip of his mustache further and further into his mouth and cast sidelong glances at the next box 
 in that box on the left were the kartassovs vronsky knew them and knew that anna was acquainted with them madame kartassova a thin little woman was standing up in her box and her back turned upon anna she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her her face was pale and angry and she was talking excitedly kartassov a fat bald man was continually looking round at anna while he attempted to soothe his wife when the wife had gone out the husband lingered a long while and tried to catch eye obviously anxious to bow to her but anna with unmistakable intention avoided noticing him and talked to iashvin whose cropped head was bent down to her kartassov went out without making his salutation and the box was left empty 
 vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartassovs and anna but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened he knew this both from what he had seen and most of all from the face of anna who he could see was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful anyone who did not know her and her circle who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration indignation and amazement that she should show herself in society and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks 
 knowing that something had happened but not knowing precisely what vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety and hoping to find out something he went toward his box purposely choosing the way round farthest from box he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances vronsky heard the name of karenin and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name with a meaning glance at his companions 
 ah vronsky when are you coming to the regiment we let you off without a supper our one of the most thorough said the colonel of his regiment 
 i stop awfully sorry another time said vronsky and he ran upstairs toward his box 
 the old countess mother with her curls was in his box varia with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor 
 leaving the princess sorokina with her mother varia held out her hand to her and began immediately to speak of what interested him she was more excited than he had ever seen her 
 i think mean and hateful and madame kartassova had no right to do it madame karenina she began 
 but what is it i know 
 what you heard 
 you know i should be the last person to hear of it 
 there a more spiteful creature than that madame kartassova 
 but what did she do 
 my husband told me she has insulted madame karenina her husband began talking to her across the box and madame kartassova made a scene she said something aloud they say something insulting and went away 
 count your maman is asking for you said the young princess sorokina peeping out of the door of the box 
 been expecting you all the while said his mother smiling sarcastically you were nowhere to be seen 
 her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight 
 good evening maman i have come to you he said coldly 
 why you going to faire la cour madame karenina she went on when princess sorokina had moved away elle fait sensation on oublie la patti pour elle 
 maman i have asked you not to say anything to me of that he answered scowling 
 only saying what saying 
 vronsky made no reply and saying a few words to princess sorokina he went away at the door he met his brother 
 ah alexei said his brother how disgusting idiot of a woman nothing else i wanted to go straight to her go together 
 vronsky did not hear him with rapid steps he went downstairs he felt that he must do something but he did not know what anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position together with pity for her suffering filled his heart he went down and made straight for box at her box stood stremov talking to her 
 there are no more tenors le moule en est brise 
 vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov 
 you came in late i think and have missed the best song anna said to vronsky glancing ironically he thought at him 
 i am a poor judge of music he said looking sternly at her 
 like prince iashvin she said smiling who considers that patti sings too loud thank you she said her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill vronsky picked up and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered she got up and went into the interior of the box 
 noticing in the next act that her box was empty vronsky rousing many an indignant hush in the silent audience went out in the middle of a solo and drove home

 anna how does the question of my love come in 
 oh if you loved me as i love if you were tortured as i am she said looking at him with an expression of terror

 of studies 
 studies serve for delight for ornament and for ability their chief use for delight 
 is in privateness and retiring for ornament is in discourse and for ability is in the judgement and disposition of business for expert men can execute and perhaps judge of particulars one by one but the general counsels and the plots and marshalling of affairs come best from those that are learned 
 to spend too much time in studies is sloth to use them too much for ornament is affectation to make judgement wholly by their rules is the humour of a scholar they perfect nature and are perfected by experience for natural abilities are like natural plants that need pruning by study and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large except they be bounded in by experience 
 
 crafty men condemn studies simple men admire them and wise men use them for they teach not their own use but that is a wisdom without them and above them won by observation read not to contradict and confute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention 
 some books also may be read by deputy and extracts made of them by others but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of book else distilled books are like common distilled waters flashy things reading maketh a full man conference a ready man and writing an exact man 
 and therefore if a man write little he had need have a great memory 
 if he confer lime he had need have a present wit and if he read little he had need 
 have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not histories make men wise poets witty the mathematics subtle natural philosophy deep moral grave 
 logic and rhetoric able to contend abeuntstucsa in mores nay there is no stond 
 or impediment in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies like as diseases 
 of the body may have appropriate exercises bowling is good for the stone and reins shooting for the lungs and breast gentle walking for the stomach riding for the head and the like 
 so if a wit be wandering let him study the mathematics for in demonstrations if his wit be called away never so little he must begin again 
 if his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences let him study the schoolmen 
 for they are cymnisectores if he be not apt to beat over matters and to call up 
 one thing to prove and illustrate another let him study the lawyers cases so every 
 defect of the mind may have a special receipt

 result of the success 
 she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter the summer passed but winter came again 
 short days less work 
 winter 
 no warmth no light no noonday the evening joining on to the morning fogs twilight the window is gray it is impossible to see clearly at it 
 the sky is but a the whole day is a cavern 
 the sun has the air of a beggar 
 a frightful season winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone her creditors harrassed her 
 fantine earned too little 
 her debts had increased 
 the thenardiers who were not promptly paid wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair and whose carriage ruined her one day they wrote to her that her little cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather that she needed a woollen skirt and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this she received the letter and crushed it in her hands all day long that evening she went into a shop at the corner of the street and pulled out her comb 
 her admirable golden hair fell to her knees 
 what splendid hair exclaimed the barber 
 how much will you give me for it said she 
 ten francs 
 cut it off 
 she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardiers this petticoat made the thenardiers furious 
 it was the money that they wanted 
 they gave the petticoat to eponine 
 the poor lark continued to shiver 
 fantine thought 
 my child is no longer cold 
 i have clothed her with my hair 
 she put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head and in which she was still pretty 
 dark thoughts held possession of heart 
 when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair she began to hate every one about her 
 she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her that he was the cause of her unhappiness she came to hate him also and most of all when she passed the factory in working hours when the workpeople were at the door she affected to laugh and sing 
 an old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said a girl who will come to a bad end 
 she took a lover the first who offered a man whom she did not love out of bravado and with rage in her heart 
 he was a miserable scamp a sort of mendicant musician a lazy beggar who beat her and who abandoned her as she had taken him in disgust 
 she adored her child 
 the lower she descended the darker everything grew about her the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart she said when i get rich i will have my cosette with me and she laughed 
 her cough did not leave her and she had sweats on her back 
 one day she received from the thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms 
 cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood 
 a miliary fever they call it expensive drugs are required 
 this is ruining us and we can no longer pay for them 
 if you do not send us forty francs before the week is out the little one will be dead 
 she burst out laughing and said to her old neighbor 
 ah they are good 
 forty francs the idea 
 that makes two napoleons where do they think i am to get them 
 these peasants are stupid truly 
 nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more 
 then she descended the stairs and emerged running and leaping and still laughing 
 some one met her and said to her what makes you so gay 
 she replied 
 a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me 
 they demand forty francs of me 
 so much for you you peasants 
 as she crossed the square she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red who was holding forth 
 he was a quack dentist on his rounds who was offering to the public full sets of teeth opiates powders and elixirs 
 fantine mingled in the group and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people 
 the espied the lovely laughing girl and suddenly exclaimed 
 you have beautiful teeth you girl there who are laughing if you want to sell me your palettes i will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them 
 what are my palettes asked fantine 
 the palettes replied the dental professor are the front teeth the two upper ones 
 how horrible exclaimed fantine 
 two napoleons grumbled a toothless old woman who was present a lucky girl 
 fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her 
 reflect my beauty two napoleons they may prove of service 
 if your heart bids you come this evening to the inn of the tillac you will find me there 
 fantine returned home 
 she was furious and related the occurrence to her good neighbor marguerite 
 can you understand such a thing is he not an abominable man 
 how can they allow such people to go about the country 
 pull out my two front teeth 
 why i should be horrible my hair will grow again but my teeth 
 ah what a monster of a man i should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story 
 he told me that he should be at the tillac this evening 
 and what did he offer asked marguerite 
 two napoleons 
 that makes forty francs 
 yes said fantine that makes forty francs 
 she remained thoughtful and began her work 
 at the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the thenardiers letter once more on the staircase 
 on her return she said to marguerite who was at work beside her 
 what is a miliary fever 
 do you know 
 yes answered the old spinster it is a disease 
 does it require many drugs 
 oh terrible drugs 
 how does one get it 
 it is a malady that one gets without knowing how 
 then it attacks children 
 children in particular 
 do people die of it 
 they may said marguerite 
 fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase 
 that evening she went out and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the rue de paris where the inns are situated 
 the next morning when marguerite entered room before they always worked together and in this manner used only one candle for the found fantine seated on her bed pale and frozen 
 she had not lain down her cap had fallen on her knees 
 her candle had burned all night and was almost entirely consumed 
 marguerite halted on the threshold petrified at this tremendous wastefulness and exclaimed 
 lord the candle is all burned out 
 something has happened 
 then she looked at fantine who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair 
 fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night 
 jesus said marguerite what is the matter with you fantine 
 nothing replied fantine 
 quite the contrary 
 my child will not die of that frightful malady for lack of succor 
 i am content 
 so saying she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table 
 ah 
 jesus god cried marguerite 
 why it is a fortune where did you get those louis 
 i got them replied fantine 
 at the same time she smiled 
 the candle illuminated her countenance it was a bloody smile 
 a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips and she had a black hole in her mouth 
 the two teeth had been extracted 
 she sent the forty francs to montfermeil 
 after all it was a ruse of the thenardiers to obtain money cosette was not ill 
 fantine threw her mirror out of the window 
 she had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it next the roof one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor and knocks you on the head every instant the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny only by bending over more and more 
 she had no longer a bed a rag which she called her coverlet a mattress on the floor and a seatless chair still remained a little rosebush which she had had dried up forgotten in one corner in the other corner was a to hold water which froze in winter and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice 
 she had lost her shame she lost her coquetry 
 a final sign 
 she went out with dirty caps whether from lack of time or from indifference she no longer mended her linen 
 as the heels wore out she dragged her stockings down into her shoes 
 this was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles she patched her bodice which was old and worn out with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement 
 the people to whom she was indebted made scenes and gave her no peace she found them in the street she found them again on her staircase she passed many a night weeping and thinking 
 her eyes were very bright and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left she coughed a great deal she deeply hated father madeleine but made no complaint 
 she sewed seventeen hours a day but a contractor for the work of prisons who made the prisoners work at a discount suddenly made prices fall which reduced the daily earnings of to nine sous seventeen hours of toil and nine sous a day 
 her creditors were more pitiless than ever 
 the dealer who had taken back nearly all his furniture said to her incessantly when will you pay me you hussy 
 what did they want of her good god 
 she felt that she was being hunted and something of the wild beast developed in her about the same time thenardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once otherwise he would turn little cosette out of doors convalescent as she was from her heavy illness into the cold and the streets and that she might do what she liked with herself and die if she chose 
 a hundred francs thought fantine but in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day 
 come said she let us sell what is left 
 the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town

 book three 
 chapter i 
 
 prince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life were constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he did not for instance say to himself this man now has influence i must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need but when he came across came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful and without any premeditation prince vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make his request 
 he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of councilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him to petersburg and staying at his house with apparent yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people 
 pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his estate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different people businessmen relations and acquaintances alike were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of noble qualities he was always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness or with your excellent heart you are yourself so honorable count or were he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair plastered down like a had come into room after the funeral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him 
 do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing him a deed to sign for the princess benefit 
 prince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone a bill for thirty thousand rubles to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to him especially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him 
 it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of him but still that happy result always remained in the future 
 more than anyone else prince vasili took possession of affairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of a man oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of count bezukhov he would call pierre or go to him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance as if he were adding every time you know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble myself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose is the only thing possible 
 well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince vasili one day closing his eyes and fingering elbow speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered we start tomorrow and giving you a place in my carriage i am very glad all our important business here is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago here is something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber the diplomatic career now lies open before you 
 notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career wished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed 
 mais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet of being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my boy and my valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added you know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so i have received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you require it go into the accounts later 
 by what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from peasants which the prince had retained for himself 
 in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather the rank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for him and acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never attained 
 of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg the guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to the ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince house in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful daughter helene 
 like the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society 
 formerly in anna presence pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary stupidest remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said was charmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty 
 in the beginning of the winter of pierre received one of anna usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you will find the beautiful helene here whom it is always delightful to see 
 when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and helene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an entertaining supposition 
 anna at home was like the former one only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor visit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young recent loss by the death of count bezukhov everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which were prince vasili and the generals had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea table pierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovna who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action seeing pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying 
 wait a bit i have something in view for you this evening she glanced at helene and smiled at her my dear helene be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for ten minutes and that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you 
 the beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions 
 she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young a girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from her heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society you think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre go 
 pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to perfection of manner if he ever thought of helene it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society 
 the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined rather to show her fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pavlovna again touched sleeve saying i hope you say that it is dull in my house again and she glanced at helene 
 helene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see helene then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation helene turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to father count bezukhov and showed them her own box princess helene asked to see the portrait of the husband on the box lid 
 that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table 
 he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox passing it across back helene stooped forward to make room and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments and having once seen this he could not help being aware it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through 
 so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am helene seemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may belong to anyone to you too said her glance and at that moment pierre felt that helene not only could but must be his wife and that it could not be otherwise 
 he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen 
 pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will 
 well i will leave you in your little corner came anna voice i see you are all right there 
 and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself 
 a little later when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna said to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house 
 this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house done up 
 a good thing but move from prince it is good to have a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince vasili i know something about that i and you are still so young you need advice be angry with me for exercising an old privilege 
 she paused as women always do expecting something after they have mentioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing she continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at helene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he muttered something and colored 
 when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said yes good looking he had understood that this woman might belong to him 
 but stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought there is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that why he was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her father bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she would love him become quite different and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of prince vasili but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress but no why did this thought never occur to me before and again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together he recalled anna words and looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and others and was seized by terror lest he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the new suit 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 many many years ago lived an emperor who thought so much of 
 new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them his 
 only ambition was to be always well dressed he did not care for his 
 soldiers and the theatre did not amuse him the only thing in 
 fact he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of 
 clothes he had a coat for every hour of the day and as one would say of a king he is in his cabinet so one could say of him the 
 emperor is in his 
 
 the great city where he resided was very gay every day many 
 strangers from all parts of the globe arrived one day two swindlers 
 came to this city they made people believe that they were weavers 
 and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined 
 their colours and patterns they said were not only exceptionally 
 beautiful but the clothes made of their material possessed the 
 wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for 
 his office or unpardonably stupid 
 
 that must be wonderful cloth thought the emperor if i were to 
 be dressed in a suit made of this cloth i should be able to find out 
 which men in my empire were unfit for their places and i could 
 distinguish the clever from the stupid i must have this cloth woven 
 for me without delay and he gave a large sum of money to the 
 swindlers in advance that they should set to work without any loss 
 of time they set up two looms and pretended to be very hard at work but they did nothing whatever on the looms they asked for the 
 finest silk and the most precious all they got they did 
 away with and worked at the empty looms till late at night 
 
 i should very much like to know how they are getting on with 
 the cloth thought the emperor but he felt rather uneasy when he 
 remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it 
 personally he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear yet he 
 thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters 
 stood everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the 
 stuff possessed and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their 
 neighbours were 
 
 i shall send my honest old minister to the weavers thought 
 the emperor he can judge best how the stuff looks for he is 
 intelligent and nobody understands his office better than he 
 the good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat 
 before the empty looms heaven preserve us he thought and opened his eyes wide i cannot see anything at all but he did not say so both swindlers requested him to come near and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours pointing to the empty looms the poor old minister tried his very best but he could see nothing for there was nothing to be seen oh dear he thought can i be so stupid i should never have thought so and nobody must know it is it possible that i am not fit for my office 
 
 no no i cannot say that i was unable to see the cloth 
 
 now have you got nothing to say said one of the swindlers 
 while he pretended to be busily weaving 
 
 oh it is very pretty exceedingly beautiful replied the old 
 minister looking through his glasses what a beautiful pattern 
 what brilliant colours i shall tell the emperor that i like the cloth 
 very much 
 
 we are pleased to hear that said the two weavers and described 
 to him the colours and explained the curious pattern the old minister 
 listened attentively that he might relate to the emperor what they 
 said and so he did 
 
 now the swindlers asked for more money silk and which 
 they required for weaving they kept everything for themselves and 
 not a thread came near the loom but they continued as hitherto to 
 work at the empty looms 
 
 soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the 
 weavers to see how they were getting on and if the cloth was nearly 
 finished like the old minister he looked and looked but could see 
 nothing as there was nothing to be seen 
 
 is it not a beautiful piece of cloth asked the two swindlers 
 showing and explaining the magnificent pattern which however did 
 not exist 
 
 i am not stupid said the man it is therefore my good 
 appointment for which i am not fit it is very strange but i must not 
 let any one know it and he praised the cloth which he did not 
 see and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine 
 pattern it is very excellent he said to the emperor 
 
 everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth at 
 last the emperor wished to see it himself while it was still on the 
 loom with a number of courtiers including the two who had already 
 been there he went to the two clever swindlers who now worked as 
 hard as they could but without using any thread 
 
 is it not magnificent said the two old statesmen who had been 
 there before your majesty must admire the colours and the 
 pattern and then they pointed to the empty looms for they 
 imagined the others could see the cloth 
 
 what is this thought the emperor i do not see anything at 
 all that is terrible am i stupid am i unfit to be emperor that 
 would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me 
 really he said turning to the weavers your cloth has our 
 most gracious approval and nodding contentedly he looked at the 
 empty loom for he did not like to say that he saw nothing all his 
 attendants who were with him looked and looked and although they 
 could not see anything more than the others they said like the 
 emperor it is very beautiful and all advised him to wear the new 
 magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take 
 place it is magnificent beautiful excellent one heard them 
 say everybody seemed to be delighted and the emperor appointed the two swindlers imperial court weavers 
 
 the whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to 
 take place the swindlers pretended to work and burned more than 
 sixteen candles people should see that they were busy to finish the 
 new suit they pretended to take the cloth from the loom 
 and worked about in the air with big scissors and sewed with 
 needles without thread and said at last the new suit is 
 ready now 
 
 the emperor and all his barons then came to the hall the 
 swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their 
 hands and said these are the trousers this is the coat and 
 here is the cloak and so on they are all as light as a cobweb 
 and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body but that 
 is just the beauty of them 
 
 indeed said all the courtiers but they could not see anything 
 for there was nothing to be seen 
 
 does it please your majesty now to graciously undress said 
 the swindlers that we may assist your majesty in putting on the 
 new suit before the large 
 
 the emperor undressed and the swindlers pretended to put the 
 new suit upon him one piece after another and the emperor looked 
 at himself in the glass from every side 
 
 how well they look how well they fit said all what a 
 beautiful pattern what fine colours that is a magnificent suit of 
 clothes 
 
 the master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the 
 canopy which was to be carried in the procession were ready 
 
 i am ready said the emperor does not my suit fit me 
 marvellously then he turned once more to the that 
 people should think he admired his garments 
 
 the chamberlains who were to carry the train stretched their 
 hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train and pretended to 
 hold something in their hands they did not like people to know that 
 they could not see anything 
 
 the emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful 
 canopy and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows 
 exclaimed indeed the new suit is incomparable what a 
 long train he has how well it fits him nobody wished to let 
 others know he saw nothing for then he would have been unfit for 
 his office or too stupid never clothes were more admired 
 but he has nothing on at all said a little child at last good 
 heavens listen to the voice of an innocent child said the father 
 and one whispered to the other what the child had said but he has 
 nothing on at all cried at last the whole people that made a deep 
 impression upon the emperor for it seemed to him that they were 
 right but he thought to himself now i must bear up to the end and the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity as if they carried the train which did not exist 
 
 the end

 of faction 
 many have an opinion not wise that for a prince to govern his estate or for a great 
 person to govern his proceedings according to the respect of factions is a principal part of policy whereas contrariwise the chiefest wisdom is either in ordering those things which are general and wherein men of several factions do nevertheless agree or in dealing with correspondence to particular persons one by one 
 but i say not that the consideration of factions is to be neglected mean men in their rising must adhere but great men that have strength in themselves were better to maintain themselves indifferent and neutral 
 yet even in beginners to adhere so moderately as he be a man of the one faction which is most passable with the other commonly giveth best way the lower and weaker faction is the firmer in conjunction and it is often seen that a few that are stiff do tire out a greater number that are more moderate when one of the factions is extinguished the remaining subdivided as the faction between lucullus and the rest of the nobles of the senate which they called optimates held out a while against the faction ofpompey and caesar but when the authority was ruled down caesar and pompey soon after brake 
 the faction or party of antonius and octavianus caesar against brutus and cassius held out likewise for a time but when brutus and cassius were overthrown then soon after antonius and octavianus brake and subdivided these examples are of wars but the same holdeth in private factions and therefore those that are seconds in factions do many times when the faction subdivided prove principals but many times also they prove ciphers and cashiered for many a strength is in opposition and when that faileth he groweth out of use it is commonly seen that men once placed take in with the contrary faction to that by which they enter thinking belike that they have the first sure and now are ready for a new purchase 
 the traitor in faction lightly goeth away with it for when matters have stuck long in balancing the winning of some one man casteth them and he getteth all the thanks the even carriage between two factions proceedeth not always of moderation but of a trueness to a self with end to make use of both certainly in italy they hold it a little suspect in popes when they have often in their mouth padre oommne and take it to be a sign of one that meaneth to refer all to the greatness of his own house kings had need beware how they side themselves and make themselves as of a faction or party for leagues within the state are ever pernicious to monarchies for they raise an obligation paramount to obligation of sovereignty and make the king tanquam wws ex nobis as was to be seen in the league of france 
 when factions are carried too high and too violently it is a sign of weakness in princes and much to the prejudice both of their authority and business the motions of factions under kings ought to be like the motions as the astronomers speak of the inferior orbs which may have their proper motions but yet still are quietly carried by the higher motion of primum mobile

 christus nos liberavit 
 what is this history of fantine 
 it is society purchasing a slave 
 from whom 
 from misery 
 from hunger cold isolation destitution 
 a dolorous bargain a soul for a morsel of bread 
 misery offers society accepts 
 the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization but it does not as yet permeate it it is said that slavery has disappeared from european civilization 
 this is a mistake 
 it still exists but it weighs only upon the woman and it is called prostitution 
 it weighs upon the woman that is to say upon grace weakness beauty maternity 
 this is not one of the least of disgraces 
 at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached nothing is left to fantine of that which she had formerly been 
 she has become marble in becoming mire 
 whoever touches her feels cold she passes she endures you she ignores you she is the severe and dishonored figure 
 life and the social order have said their last word for her 
 all has happened to her that will happen to her she has felt everything borne everything experienced everything suffered everything lost everything mourned everything she is resigned with that resignation which resembles indifference as death resembles sleep 
 she no longer avoids anything let all the clouds fall upon her and all the ocean sweep over her what matters it to her 
 she is a sponge that is soaked 
 at least she believes it to be so but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever 
 alas 
 what are all these fates driven on whither are they going 
 why are they thus 
 he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow 
 he is alone 
 his name is god

 book three 
 chapter ii 
 
 in november prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had latterly spent whole days at home that is in prince house where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to her 
 this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasili to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to him but never mind that was not behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well god be with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it must be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be name day i will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair yes my affair i am her father 
 six weeks after anna at home and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had not left prince and felt with terror that in eyes he was every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasili who had rarely before given receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint expectation prince vasili in the rare moments when he was at home would take hand in passing and draw it downwards or hold out his wrinkled cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be in to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vasili when he stayed in as he said for sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark showing that it did not interest her or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile 
 she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need resolution can it be that i have none 
 he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will 
 on name day a small party of just their own people as his wife said met for supper at prince all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper princess kuragina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the more important guests an old general and his wife and anna pavlovna scherer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests and there too sat the members of the family and pierre and helene side by side prince vasili was not having any supper he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some mary viktorovna or other at the center of the table prince vasili attracted attention with a facetious smile on his face he was telling the ladies about last meeting of the imperial council at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governor general of petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich in which the emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the loyalty that the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey kuzmich from all sides reports reach me etc 
 well and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked one of the ladies 
 exactly not a breadth farther answered prince vasili laughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sides sergey kuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther he began the rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered sergey he sobbed tears and from all sides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and again sergey kuzmich from all sides and tears till at last somebody else was asked to read it 
 kuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeated laughing 
 be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent man our dear vyazmitinov 
 everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where the honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing to do with sergey kuzmich a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed to pierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said yes getting on it will all be settled today anna pavlovna threatened him on behalf of our dear vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read a congratulation on his future and on his happiness the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say yes nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers happiness 
 into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red broad and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone 
 pierre felt that he the center of it all and this both pleased and embarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind 
 so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened how quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself alone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are all expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes 
 or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it awkward to attract attention and to be considered a lucky man and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so he consoled himself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then there was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it begin when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why they all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said 
 i am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeated prince vasili a third time how you are my dear fellow 
 prince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and helene well what of it if you all know it thought pierre what of it the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile and helene smiled too 
 when did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince vasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute 
 how can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre 
 yes from olmutz he answered with a sigh 
 after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave of helene some as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with happiness the old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the old fool he thought that princess helene will be beautiful still when fifty 
 i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old princess kissing her soundly if i this headache have stayed longer 
 the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her happiness 
 while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting he had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her but had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable but he could not make up his mind to take the final step he felt ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone place here beside helene this happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered to him this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you 
 but as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had 
 some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in the large drawing room prince vasili came up to pierre with languid footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of severity changed and he drew hand downwards made him sit down and smiled affectionately 
 well lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents 
 and he again turned to pierre 
 sergey kuzmich from all sides he said unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat 
 pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then and prince vasili saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched pierre he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcerted and her look seemed to say well it is your own fault 
 the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmich asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it 
 when prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess his wife was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre 
 of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear 
 marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady 
 prince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself 
 aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about 
 the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and helene still sat talking just as before 
 still the same she said to her husband 
 prince vasili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it 
 thank god said prince vasili my wife has told me everything he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter my dear boy lelya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved your father and she will make you a good wife god bless you 
 he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks 
 princess come here he shouted 
 the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful hand several times after a while they were left alone again 
 all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell 
 helene he said aloud and paused 
 something special is always said in such cases he thought but could not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face she drew nearer to him her face flushed 
 oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles 
 pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered unpleasantly excited expression 
 it is too late now done besides i love her thought pierre 
 je vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at such moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself 
 i love you 
 six weeks later he was married and settled in count large newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people said of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the cock and the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there were two cocks one on the the other on the roof 
 they were both arrogant but which of the two rendered most service 
 
 tell us your opinion keep to ours just the same though 
 the poultry yard was divided by some planks from another yard in 
 which there was a and on the lay and grew a large 
 cucumber which was conscious of being a plant 
 
 one is born to that said the cucumber to itself not all can 
 be born cucumbers there must be other things too the hens the 
 ducks and all the animals in the next yard are creatures too now i 
 have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank he is certainly of 
 much more importance than the who is placed so high and even creak much less crow the latter has neither hens nor 
 chicks and only thinks of himself and perspires verdigris no the 
 yard cock is really a cock his step is a dance his crowing is music 
 and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like if he would 
 only come in here even if he ate me up stump stalk and all and i 
 had to dissolve in his body it would be a happy death said the 
 cucumber 
 
 in the night there was a terrible storm the hens chicks and 
 even the cock sought shelter the wind tore down the planks between 
 the two yards with a crash the tiles came tumbling down but the 
 sat firm he did not even turn round for he could not 
 and yet he was young and freshly cast but prudent and sedate he 
 had been born old and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the 
 air the sparrows and the swallows no he despised them these 
 mean little piping birds these common whistlers he admitted that the 
 pigeons large and white and shining like looked like 
 a kind of but they were fat and stupid and all their 
 thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food and besides they were tiresome things to converse with the birds of passage had also paid the a visit and told him of foreign countries of airy caravans and robber stories that made hair stand on end all this was new and interesting that is for 
 the first time but afterwards as the found out they 
 repeated themselves and always told the same stories and 
 very tedious and there was no one with whom one could associate 
 for one and all were stale and 
 
 the world is no good he said everything in it is so stupid 
 the was puffed up and that quality would have made 
 him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it but it 
 had eyes only for the yard cock who was now in the yard with it 
 the wind had blown the planks but the storm was over 
 
 what do you think of that crowing said the yard cock to the 
 hens and chickens it was a little rough it wanted elegance 
 and the hens and chickens came up on the and the cock 
 strutted about like a lord 
 
 garden plant he said to the cucumber and in that one word 
 his deep learning showed itself and it forgot that he was pecking 
 at her and eating it up a happy death 
 
 the hens and the chickens came for where one runs the others 
 run too they clucked and chirped and looked at the cock and were 
 proud that he was of their kind 
 
 he crowed the chickens will grow up into 
 great hens at once if i cry it out in the of the world 
 and hens and chicks clucked and chirped and the cock announced 
 a great piece of news 
 
 a cock can lay an egg and do you know in that egg a 
 basilisk no one can stand the sight of such a thing people know 
 that and now you know it too you know what is in me and what a 
 champion of all cocks i am 
 
 with that the yard cock flapped his wings made his comb swell up 
 and crowed again and they all shuddered the hens and the little 
 chicks but they were very proud that one of their number was such a 
 champion of all cocks they clucked and chirped till the 
 heard he heard it but he did not stir 
 
 everything is very stupid the said to himself 
 
 the yard cock lays no eggs and i am too lazy to do so if i liked i 
 could lay a but the world is not worth even a 
 everything is so stupid i want to sit here any longer 
 
 with that the broke off but he did not kill the yard 
 cock although the hens said that had been his intention and what 
 is the moral better to crow than to be puffed up and break off 
 
 the end

 of ceremonies respects 
 he that is only real had need have exceeding great parts of virtue as the stone 
 had need to be rich that is set without foil but if a man mark it well it is in 
 praise and commendation of men as it is in gettings and gains for the proverb is 
 true that light gains make heavy purses for light gains come thick whereas great 
 come but now and then so it is true that small matters win great commendation 
 because they are continually in use and in note whereas the occasion of any great 
 virtue cometh but on festivals 
 therefore it doth much add to a reputation and is as queen isabella said like perpetual letters commendatory to have good forms to attain them it almost sufficeth not to despise them for so shall a man observe them in others and let him trust himself with the rest for if he labour too much to express them he shall lose their grace which is to be natural and unaffected 
 some behaviour is like a verse wherein every syllable is measured 
 how can a man comprehend great matters that hreaketh his mind too much to small observations not to use ceremonies at all is to teach others not to use them again and so diminisheth respect to himself especially they be not to be omitted to 
 strangers and formal natures but the dwelling upon them and exalting them above 
 the moon is not only tedious but doth diminish the faith and credit of him that 
 speaks 
 and certainly there is a kind of conveying of effectual and imprinting 
 passages amongst compliments which is of singular use if a man can hit upon it 
 amongst a peers a man shall be sure of familiarity and therefore it is good 
 a little to keep state amongst a inferiors one shall be sure of reverence 
 and therefore it is good a little to be familiar he that is too much in anything 
 so that he giveth another occasion of satiety maketh himself cheap to apply self to others is good so it be with demonstration that a man doth it upon regard and not upon facility it is a good precept generally in seconding another yet to add somewhat of own as if you will grant his opinion let it be with some distinction if you will follow his motion let it be with condition if you allow 
 his counsel let it be with alleging further reason men had need beware how they 
 be too perfect in compliments for be they never so sufficient otherwise their 
 enviers will be sure to give them that attribute to the disadvantage of their greater 
 virtues it is loss also in business to be too full of respects or to be too curious 
 in observing times and opportunities solomon saith he that considered the wind 
 shall not sow and he that looketh to the clouds shall not reap a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds behaviour should be like their apparel not too strait or point device but free for exercise or motion

 chapter xii 
 
 m inactivity 
 there is in all small towns and there was at m sur m in particular a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year in paris 
 these are beings of the great neuter species 
 impotent men parasites cyphers who have a little land a little folly a little wit who would be rustics in a and who think themselves gentlemen in the who say my fields my peasants my woods who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war hunt smoke yawn drink smell of tobacco play billiards stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence live at the cafe dine at the inn have a dog which eats the bones under the table and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table who stick at a sou exaggerate the fashions admire tragedy despise women wear out their old boots copy london through paris and paris through the medium of grow old as dullards never work serve no use and do no great harm 
 m felix tholomyes had he remained in his own province and never beheld paris would have been one of these men 
 if they were richer one would say they are dandies if they were poorer one would say they are idlers 
 they are simply men without employment 
 among these unemployed there are bores the bored dreamers and some knaves 
 at that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar a big cravat a watch with trinkets three vests of different colors worn one on top of the red and blue inside of a olive coat with a codfish tail a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite but always uneven number of lines varying from one to limit which was never exceeded add to this high shoes with little irons on the heels a tall hat with a narrow brim hair worn in a tuft an enormous cane and conversation set off by puns of potier 
 over all spurs and a mustache 
 at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois and spurs the pedestrian 
 the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches 
 it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with the king of spain of bolivar against morillo hats were royalist and were called morillos liberals wore hats with wide brims which were called bolivars 
 eight or ten months then after that which is related in the preceding pages towards the first of january on a snowy evening one of these dandies one of these unemployed a right thinker for he wore a morillo and was moreover warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair in front of the officers cafe 
 this dandy was smoking for he was decidedly fashionable 
 each time that the woman passed in front of him he bestowed on her together with a puff from his cigar some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful such as how ugly you are will you get out of my have no teeth etc etc this gentleman was known as m bamatabois 
 the woman a melancholy decorated spectre which went and came through the snow made him no reply did not even glance at him and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence and with a sombre regularity which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods 
 the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh bent down picked up a handful of snow from the pavement and thrust it abruptly into her back between her bare shoulders 
 the woman uttered a roar whirled round gave a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her nails in his face with the most frightful words which could fall from the into the gutter 
 these insults poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy did indeed proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth it was fantine 
 at the noise thus produced the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe collected and a large and merry circle hooting and applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman 
 the man struggling his hat on the ground the woman striking out with feet and fists bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth livid with wrath horrible 
 suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her satin bodice which was covered with mud and said to her follow me 
 the woman raised her head her furious voice suddenly died away her eyes were glassy she turned pale instead of livid and she trembled with a quiver of terror 
 she had recognized javert 
 the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape

 book three 
 chapter iii 
 
 old prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasili in november announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasili my son anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he feels for you 
 it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news 
 prince nicholas frowned but said nothing 
 a fortnight after the letter prince servants came one evening in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day 
 old bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince character but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and alexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and now from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned him on the day of prince arrival prince bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince visit he was in a bad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architect not to go the prince with his report 
 do you hear how walking said tikhon drawing the attention to the sound of the footsteps stepping flat on his heels we know what that means 
 however at nine the prince in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince went through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings frowning and silent 
 can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to the house 
 the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor 
 the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be thanked thought the overseer the storm has blown over 
 it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i heard your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor 
 the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him frowning 
 what a minister what minister who gave orders he said in his shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess my daughter but for a minister for me there are no ministers 
 your honor i thought 
 you thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackgaurds teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow thought blackguards shouted the prince rapidly 
 but although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to shout blackgaurds throw the snow back on the road did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house 
 before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew that the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the same as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast eyes what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has done before that in the dumps 
 the prince looked at his frightened face and snorted 
 fool or dummy he muttered 
 and the other one is not here been telling tales he thought referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room 
 where is the princess he asked hiding 
 she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright smile so she come down it is natural in her state 
 hm hm muttered the prince sitting down 
 his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung it away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the little princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear 
 i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne heaven knows what a fright might do 
 in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent whole days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him 
 so we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers his excellency prince vasili kuragin and his son i understand she said inquiringly 
 hm his excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the service said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i want him he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell today eh afraid of the minister as that idiot alpatych called him this morning 
 no mon pere 
 though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and after the soup the prince became more genial 
 after dinner he went to see his the little princess was sitting at a small table chattering with masha her maid she grew pale on seeing her 
 she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheeks had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down 
 yes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the question as to how she felt 
 do you want anything 
 no merci mon pere 
 well all right all right 
 he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood with bowed head 
 has the snow been shoveled back 
 yes your excellency forgive me for sake it was only my stupidity 
 all right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his unnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and then proceeded to his study 
 prince vasili arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow 
 prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them 
 anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and fixed his large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well and amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much money that never does any harm thought anatole 
 he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his room with the and victorious air natural to him prince two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered as if to say yes how i want you to look 
 i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey 
 enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince 
 if he starts a row go away said prince anatole i bear those old men eh 
 remember for you everything depends on this 
 in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room vainly trying to master her agitation 
 why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter the drawing room even if i like him i now be myself with him the mere thought of her look filled her with terror the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from masha the maid the necessary report of how handsome the son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into princess room 
 you know come marie said the little princess waddling in and sinking heavily into an armchair 
 she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle toilet which rendered her fresh and prettyface yet more attractive 
 what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all 
 the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed princess was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty 
 no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may be at stake but this one is too light not becoming 
 it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a scarf the little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other 
 no it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no mary really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said to the maid bring the princess her gray dress and see mademoiselle bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure 
 but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst into sobs 
 come dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one more little effort 
 the little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princess mary 
 well now arrange something quite simple and becoming she said 
 the three voices hers mademoiselle and who was laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping of birds 
 no leave me alone said princess mary 
 her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist 
 at least change your coiffure said the little princess i tell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least not in the least please change it 
 leave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to me answered a voice struggling with tears 
 mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination 
 you will change it you said lise and as princess mary gave no answer she left the room 
 princess mary was left alone she did not comply with request she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own she fancied a child her own such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her daughter at her own breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought 
 please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came the voice at the door 
 she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful doubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a man be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she said how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am i to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thy will and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be not anxious or envious future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whose care not a hair of head can fall

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the fir tree 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far down in the forest where the warm sun and the fresh air 
 made a sweet grew a pretty little and yet 
 it was not happy it wished so much to be tall like its companions 
 the pines and firs which grew around it the sun shone and the soft 
 air fluttered its leaves and the little peasant children passed by 
 prattling merrily but the heeded them not sometimes the 
 children would bring a large basket of raspberries or strawberries 
 wreathed on a straw and seat themselves near the and say 
 is it not a pretty little tree which made it feel more unhappy than 
 before and yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller 
 every year for by the number of joints in the stem of a we 
 can discover its age still as it grew it complained oh how i 
 wish i were as tall as the other trees then i would spread out my 
 branches on every side and my top would the wide world 
 i should have the birds building their nests on my boughs and when 
 the wind blew i should bow with stately dignity like my tall companions the tree was so discontented that it took no pleasure in the warm sunshine the birds or the rosy clouds that floated over 
 it morning and evening sometimes in winter when the snow lay 
 white and glittering on the ground a hare would come springing along and jump right over the little tree and then how mortified it would feel two winters passed and when the third arrived the tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it yet it 
 remained unsatisfied and would exclaim oh if i could but keep on 
 growing tall and old there is nothing else worth caring for in the 
 world in the autumn as usual the came and cut down 
 several of the tallest trees and the young which was now 
 grown to its full height shuddered as the noble trees fell to the 
 earth with a crash after the branches were lopped off the trunks 
 looked so slender and bare that they could scarcely be recognized 
 
 then they were placed upon wagons and drawn by horses out of the 
 forest where were they going what would become of them the 
 young wished very much to know so in the spring when the 
 swallows and the storks came it asked do you know where those trees were taken did you meet them 
 
 the swallows knew nothing but the stork after a little 
 reflection nodded his head and said yes i think i do i met 
 several new ships when i flew from egypt and they had fine masts that smelt like fir i think these must have been the trees i assure you 
 they were stately very stately 
 
 oh how i wish i were tall enough to go on the sea said the 
 what is the sea and what does it look like 
 
 it would take too much time to explain said the stork flying 
 quickly away 
 
 rejoice in thy youth said the sunbeam rejoice in thy fresh 
 growth and the young life that is in thee 
 
 and the wind kissed the tree and the dew watered it with tears 
 but the regarded them not 
 
 drew near and many young trees were cut down some even smaller and younger than the who enjoyed neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home these young trees which were chosen for their beauty kept their branches and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of the forest 
 
 where are they going asked the they are not taller 
 than i am indeed one is much less and why are the branches not 
 cut off where are they going 
 
 we know we know sang the sparrows we have looked in at the 
 windows of the houses in the town and we know what is done with them 
 
 they are dressed up in the most splendid manner we have seen them 
 standing in the middle of a warm room and adorned with all sorts of 
 beautiful things honey cakes gilded apples playthings and many 
 hundreds of wax tapers 
 
 and then asked the trembling through all its 
 branches and then what happens 
 
 we did not see any more said the sparrows but this was enough 
 for us 
 
 i wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen to me 
 thought the it would be much better than crossing the 
 sea i long for it almost with pain oh when will christmas be 
 here i am now as tall and well grown as those which were taken away last year oh that i were now laid on the wagon or standing in the warm room with all that brightness and splendor around me 
 something better and more beautiful is to come after or the trees 
 would not be so decked out yes what follows will be grander and more splendid what can it be i am weary with longing i scarcely know how i feel 
 
 rejoice with us said the air and the sunlight enjoy thine own 
 bright life in the fresh air 
 
 but the tree would not rejoice though it grew taller every day 
 and winter and summer its foliage might be seen in the 
 forest while passers by would say what a beautiful tree 
 
 a short time before christmas the discontented was the 
 first to fall as the axe cut through the stem and divided the 
 pith the tree fell with a groan to the earth conscious of pain and 
 faintness and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness in 
 sorrow at leaving its home in the forest it knew that it should never 
 again see its dear old companions the trees nor the little bushes 
 and flowers that had grown by its side perhaps not 
 even the birds neither was the journey at all pleasant the tree 
 first recovered itself while being unpacked in the courtyard of a 
 house with several other trees and it heard a man say we only want one and this is the prettiest 
 
 then came two servants in grand livery and carried the 
 into a large and beautiful apartment on the walls hung pictures 
 and near the great stove stood great china vases with lions on the 
 lids there were rocking chairs silken sofas large tables covered 
 with pictures books and playthings worth a great deal of money at 
 least the children said so then the was placed in a large 
 tub full of sand but green baize hung all around it so that no 
 one could see it was a tub and it stood on a very handsome carpet 
 how the trembled what was going to happen to him now some young ladies came and the servants helped them to adorn the tree 
 
 on one branch they hung little bags cut out of colored paper and each bag was filled with sweetmeats from other branches hung gilded apples and walnuts as if they had grown there and above and all round were hundreds of red blue and white tapers which were fastened on the branches dolls exactly like real babies were placed under the green leaves the tree had never seen such things before and at the very top was fastened a glittering star made of tinsel oh it was very beautiful 
 
 this evening they all exclaimed how bright it will be 
 oh that the evening were come thought the tree and the tapers 
 lighted then i shall know what else is going to happen will the 
 trees of the forest come to see me i wonder if the sparrows will peep 
 in at the windows as they fly shall i grow faster here and keep on 
 all these ornaments summer and winter but guessing was of very 
 little use it made his bark ache and this pain is as bad for a 
 slender as headache is for us at last the tapers were 
 lighted and then what a glistening blaze of light the tree presented 
 it trembled so with joy in all its branches that one of the candles 
 fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them help help 
 exclaimed the young ladies but there was no danger for they 
 quickly extinguished the fire after this the tree tried not to 
 tremble at all though the fire frightened him he was so anxious 
 not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments even while their 
 brilliancy dazzled him and now the folding doors were thrown open 
 and a troop of children rushed in as if they intended to upset the 
 tree they were followed more silently by their elders for a moment 
 the little ones stood silent with astonishment and then they 
 shouted for joy till the room rang and they danced merrily round the 
 tree while one present after another was taken from it 
 
 what are they doing what will happen next thought the fir 
 at last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put out 
 then the children received permission to plunder the tree 
 
 oh how they rushed upon it till the branches cracked and had it 
 not been fastened with the glistening star to the ceiling it must 
 have been thrown down the children then danced about with their 
 pretty toys and no one noticed the tree except the maid 
 who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten 
 
 a story a story cried the children pulling a little fat man 
 towards the tree 
 
 now we shall be in the green shade said the man as he seated 
 himself under it and the tree will have the pleasure of hearing 
 also but i shall only relate one story what shall it be 
 
 or humpty dumpty who fell down stairs but soon got up again and at last married a princess 
 
 cried some humpty dumpty cried others and 
 there was a fine shouting and crying out but the remained 
 quite still and thought to himself shall i have anything to do with 
 all this but he had already amused them as much as they wished 
 then the old man told them the story of humpty dumpty how he fell down stairs and was raised up again and married a princess and the 
 children clapped their hands and cried tell another tell another for they wanted to hear the story of but they only had humpty dumpty after this the became quite silent and thoughtful never had the birds in the forest told such tales as humpty dumpty who fell down stairs and yet married a 
 princess 
 
 ah yes so it happens in the world thought the he 
 believed it all because it was related by such a nice man ah 
 well he thought who knows perhaps i may fall down too and 
 marry a princess and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening 
 expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings gold 
 and fruit i will not tremble thought he i will enjoy 
 all my splendor and i shall hear the story of humpty dumpty again 
 and perhaps and the tree remained quiet and thoughtful all night in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in now thought the fir all my splendor is going to begin again but they dragged him out of the room and up stairs to the garret and threw him on the floor in a dark corner where no daylight shone and there they left him what does this mean thought the tree what am i to do here i can hear nothing in a place like this and he had time enough to think for days and nights passed and no one came near him and when at last somebody did come it was only to put away large boxes in a corner so the tree was completely hidden from sight as if it had never existed it is winter now thought the tree the ground is hard and covered with snow so that people cannot plant me i shall be sheltered here i dare say until spring comes 
 
 how thoughtful and kind everybody is to me still i wish this place 
 were not so dark as well as lonely with not even a little hare to 
 look at how pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow lay on 
 the ground when the hare would run by yes and jump over me too 
 although i did not like it then oh it is terrible lonely here 
 
 squeak squeak said a little mouse creeping cautiously towards 
 the tree then came another and they both sniffed at the and 
 crept between the branches 
 
 oh it is very cold said the little mouse or else we should 
 be so comfortable here we you old 
 i am not old said the there are many who are older 
 than i am 
 
 where do you come from and what do you know asked the were full of curiosity have you seen the most beautiful places in the world and can you tell us all about them and have you been in the storeroom where cheeses lie on the shelf and hams hang from the ceiling one can run about on tallow candles there and go in thin and come out fat 
 
 i know nothing of that place said the but i know the 
 wood where the sun shines and the birds sing and then the tree 
 told the little mice all about its youth they had never heard such an 
 account in their lives and after they had listened to it attentively 
 they said what a number of things you have seen you must have 
 been very happy 
 
 happy exclaimed the and then as he reflected upon 
 what he had been telling them he said ah yes after all those were 
 happy days but when he went on and related all about 
 and how he had been dressed up with cakes and mice said how happy you must have been you old 
 
 i am not old at all replied the tree i only came from the 
 forest this winter i am now checked in my growth 
 
 what splendid stories you can relate said the little mice 
 and the next night four other mice came with them to hear what the 
 tree had to tell the more he talked the more he remembered and 
 then he thought to himself those were happy days but they may 
 come again humpty dumpty fell down stairs and yet he married the 
 princess perhaps i may marry a princess too and the 
 thought of the pretty little that grew in the forest which 
 was to him a real beautiful princess 
 
 who is humpty dumpty asked the little mice and then the tree 
 related the whole story he could remember every single word and 
 the little mice was so delighted with it that they were ready to jump 
 to the top of the tree the next night a great many more mice made 
 their appearance and on sunday two rats came with them but they 
 said it was not a pretty story at all and the little mice were 
 very sorry for it made them also think less of it 
 
 do you know only one story asked the rats 
 
 only one replied the i heard it on the happiest 
 evening of my life but i did not know i was so happy at the time 
 
 we think it is a very miserable story said the rats you 
 know any story about bacon or tallow in the storeroom 
 
 no replied the tree 
 
 many thanks to you then replied the rats and they marched off 
 the little mice also kept away after this and the tree sighed 
 and said it was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat round 
 me and listened while i talked now that is all passed too however i 
 shall consider myself happy when some one comes to take me out of this place but would this ever happen yes one morning people came to clear out the garret the boxes were packed away and the tree was pulled out of the corner and thrown roughly on the garret floor then the servant dragged it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone now life is beginning again said the tree rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air then it was carried down stairs and 
 taken into the courtyard so quickly that it forgot to think of 
 itself and could only look about there was so much to be seen the 
 court was close to a garden where everything looked blooming fresh and fragrant roses hung over the little palings the were in blossom while the swallows flew here and there crying twit twit twit my mate is coming but it was not the they 
 meant now i shall live cried the tree joyfully spreading out 
 its branches but alas they were all withered and yellow and it 
 lay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles the star of gold paper 
 still stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine in 
 the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had 
 danced round the tree at christmas and had been so happy the 
 youngest saw the gilded star and ran and pulled it off the tree 
 look what is sticking to the ugly old said the child 
 treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots and the 
 tree saw all the fresh bright flowers in the garden and then looked 
 at itself and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the 
 garret it thought of its fresh youth in the forest of the merry 
 christmas evening and of the little mice who had listened to the 
 story of humpty dumpty past past said the old tree oh had 
 i but enjoyed myself while i could have done so but now it is too 
 late then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces till 
 a large bundle lay in a heap on the ground the pieces were placed 
 in a fire under the copper and they quickly blazed up brightly while 
 the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a 
 then the children who were at play came and seated themselves in 
 front of the fire and looked at it and cried pop pop but at each 
 pop which was a deep sigh the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest and of christmas evening and of humpty dumpty the only story it had ever heard or knew how to relate till at last it was 
 consumed the boys still played in the garden and the youngest wore 
 the golden star on his breast with which the tree had been adorned 
 during the happiest evening of its existence now all was past the 
 life was past and the story also for all stories must come 
 to an end at last 
 
 the end

 most but if he be an impudent flatterer look wherein a man is conscious to himself 
 that he is most defective and is most out of countenance in himself that will the

 book descent 
 chapter xiii 
 
 the solution of some questions connected with the municipal police 
 javert thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him she yielded mechanically 
 neither he nor she uttered a word the cloud of spectators followed jesting in a paroxysm of delight supreme misery an occasion for obscenity 
 on arriving at the police station which was a low room warmed by a stove with a glazed and grated door opening on the street and guarded by a detachment javert opened the door entered with fantine and shut the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who raised themselves on tiptoe and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the in their effort to see curiosity is a sort of gluttony 
 to see is to devour 
 on entering fantine fell down in a corner motionless and mute crouching down like a terrified dog 
 the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table javert seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began to write 
 this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police 
 the latter do what they please punish them as seems good to them and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty javert was impassive his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever nevertheless he was seriously and deeply preoccupied 
 it was one of those moments when he was exercising without control but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience his redoubtable discretionary power 
 at that moment he was conscious that his police stool was a tribunal 
 he was entering judgment he judged and condemned 
 he summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing the more he examined the deed of this woman the more shocked he felt it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime he had just beheld yonder in the street society in the person of a freeholder and an elector insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales 
 a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen 
 he had seen that he javert 
 he wrote in silence 
 when he had finished he signed the paper folded it and said to the sergeant of the guard as he handed it to him take three men and conduct this creature to jail 
 then turning to fantine you are to have six months of it the unhappy woman shuddered 
 six months six months of prison she exclaimed 
 six months in which to earn seven sous a day 
 but what will become of cosette my daughter my daughter 
 but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs do you know that monsieur inspector 
 she dragged herself across the damp floor among the muddy boots of all those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides on her knees 
 monsieur javert said she i beseech your mercy 
 i assure you that i was not in the wrong 
 if you had seen the beginning you would have seen 
 i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame 
 that gentleman the bourgeois whom i do not know put snow in my back 
 has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably and doing no harm to any one i am rather ill as you see 
 and then he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time 
 you are ugly you have no teeth i know well that i have no longer those teeth 
 i did nothing i said to myself the gentleman is amusing himself 
 i was honest with him i did not speak to him 
 it was at that moment that he put the snow down my back 
 monsieur javert good monsieur inspector is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true 
 perhaps i did wrong to get angry you know that one is not master of self at the first moment one gives way to vivacity and then when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it 
 i did wrong to spoil that hat 
 why did he go away 
 i would ask his pardon 
 oh my god 
 it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon 
 do me the favor for this once monsieur javert hold you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day it is not the fault but seven sous is earnings and just fancy i must pay one hundred francs or my little girl will be sent to me 
 oh my god 
 i cannot have her with me what i do is so vile 
 oh my cosette 
 oh my little angel of the holy virgin what will become of her poor creature 
 i will tell you it is the thenardiers peasants and such people are unreasonable 
 they want money 
 put me in prison you see there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may in the very heart of the winter and you must have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert if she were older she might earn her living but it cannot be done at that age 
 i am not a bad woman at bottom 
 it is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what i am 
 if i have drunk brandy it was out of misery 
 i do not love it but it benumbs the senses when i was happy it was only necessary to glance into my closets and it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and untidy woman 
 i had linen a great deal of linen 
 have pity on me monsieur javert 
 she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with sobs blinded with tears her neck bare wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short cough stammering softly with a voice of agony 
 great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray which transfigures the unhappy at that moment fantine had become beautiful once more 
 from time to time she paused and tenderly kissed the police coat she would have softened a heart of granite but a heart of wood cannot be softened 
 come said javert i have heard you out 
 have you entirely finished you will get six months 
 now march 
 the eternal father in person could do nothing more 
 at these solemn words the eternal father in person could do nothing more she understood that her fate was sealed she sank down murmuring mercy 
 javert turned his back 
 the soldiers seized her by the arms 
 a few moments earlier a man had entered but no one had paid any heed to him 
 he shut the door leaned his back against it and listened to despairing supplications 
 at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said 
 one moment if you please 
 javert raised his eyes and recognized m madeleine 
 he removed his hat and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness 
 excuse me mr mayor 
 the words mr mayor produced a curious effect upon fantine she rose to her feet with one bound like a spectre springing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up to m madeleine before any one could prevent her and gazing intently at him with a bewildered air she cried 
 ah so it is you who are m le maire 
 then she burst into a laugh and spit in his face 
 m madeleine wiped his face and said 
 inspector javert set this woman at liberty 
 javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad 
 he experienced at that moment blow upon blow and almost simultaneously the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life to see a woman of the town spit in the face was a thing so monstrous that in his most daring flights of fancy he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible on the other hand at the very bottom of his thought he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was and as to what this mayor might be and then he with horror caught a glimpse of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack but when he beheld that mayor that magistrate calmly wipe his face and say set this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement thought and word failed him equally the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case he remained mute 
 the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantine she raised her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stove like a person who is reeling 
 nevertheless she glanced about her and began to speak in a low voice as though talking to herself 
 at liberty 
 i am to be allowed to go 
 i am not to go to prison for six months 
 who said that 
 it is not possible that any one could have said that 
 i did not hear aright 
 it cannot have been that monster of a mayor 
 was it you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be set free 
 oh see here 
 i will tell you about it and you will let me go 
 that monster of a mayor that old blackguard of a mayor is the cause of all 
 just imagine monsieur javert he turned me out all because of a pack of rascally women who gossip in the workroom 
 if that is not a horror what is 
 to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly then i could no longer earn enough and all this misery followed in the first place there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make and that is to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people 
 i will explain it to you you see 
 you are earning twelve sous at the price falls to nine sous and it is not enough to live on then one has to become whatever one can 
 as for me i had my little cosette and i was actually forced to become a bad woman now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief 
 after that i stamped on that hat in front of the officers cafe but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow 
 we women have but one silk dress for evening wear you see that i did not do wrong monsieur javert and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i and who are much happier 
 o monsieur javert it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free was it not 
 make inquiries speak to my landlord i am paying my rent now they will tell you that i am perfectly honest 
 ah my god 
 i beg your pardon i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke 
 m madeleine listened to her with profound attention 
 while she was speaking he fumbled in his waistcoat drew out his purse and opened it 
 it was empty 
 he put it back in his pocket he said to fantine how much did you say that you owed 
 fantine who was looking at javert only turned towards him 
 was i speaking to you 
 then addressing the soldiers 
 say you fellows did you see how i spit in his face ah you old wretch of a mayor you came here to frighten me but not afraid of you 
 i am afraid of monsieur javert i am afraid of my good monsieur javert 
 so saying she turned to the inspector again 
 and yet you see mr inspector it is necessary to be just i understand that you are just mr inspector in fact it is perfectly simple 
 a man amuses himself by putting snow down a back and that makes the officers laugh one must divert themselves in some way and we are here for them to amuse themselves with of course 
 and then you you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order you lead off the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you are a good man you say that i am to be set at liberty it is for the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child only do it again you hussy 
 oh 
 i do it again monsieur javert 
 they may do whatever they please to me now i will not stir 
 but you see i cried because it hurt me i was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all and then as i told you i am not well i have a cough i seem to have a burning ball in my stomach and the doctor tells me take care of yourself 
 here feel give me your hand be afraid it is here 
 she no longer wept her voice was caressing she placed coarse hand on her delicate white throat and looked smilingly at him 
 all at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments dropped the folds of her skirt which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along almost to the height of her knee and stepped towards the door saying to the soldiers in a low voice and with a friendly nod 
 children monsieur has said that i am to be released and i am going 
 she laid her hand on the latch of the door 
 one step more and she would be in the street 
 javert up to that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere 
 the sound of the latch roused him 
 he raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level ferocious in the wild beast atrocious in the man of no estate 
 sergeant he cried you see that that jade is walking off who bade you let her go 
 i said madeleine 
 fantine trembled at the sound of voice and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen at the sound of voice she turned around and from that moment forth she uttered no word nor dared so much as to breathe freely but her glance strayed from madeleine to javert and from javert to madeleine in turn according to which was speaking 
 it was evident that javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done after the suggestion that fantine should be set at liberty 
 had he reached the point of forgetting the presence 
 had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending it 
 or in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours did he say to himself that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions that it was indispensable that the small should be made great that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice and that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government society in its entirety was personified in him javert 
 however that may be when m madeleine uttered that word i as we have just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor pale cold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and say to him with downcast eyes but a firm voice 
 mr mayor that cannot be 
 why not said m madeleine 
 this miserable woman has insulted a citizen 
 inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and conciliating tone listen 
 you are an honest man and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you 
 here is the true state of the case i was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away there were still groups of people standing about and i made inquiries and learned everything it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police 
 javert retorted 
 this wretch has just insulted monsieur le maire 
 that concerns me said m madeleine 
 my own insult belongs to me i think 
 i can do what i please about it 
 i beg monsieur le pardon 
 the insult is not to him but to the law 
 inspector javert replied m madeleine the highest law is conscience 
 i have heard this woman i know what i am doing 
 and i mr mayor do not know what i see 
 then content yourself with obeying 
 i am obeying my duty 
 my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison 
 m madeleine replied gently 
 heed this well she will not serve a single day 
 at this decisive word javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful 
 i am sorry to oppose monsieur le maire it is for the first time in my life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority 
 i confine myself since monsieur le maire desires it to the question of the gentleman 
 i was present this woman flung herself on monsieur bamatabnois who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cut stone 
 such things as there are in the world in any case monsieur le maire this is a question of police regulations in the streets and concerns me and i shall detain this woman fantine 
 then m madeleine folded his arms and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto 
 the matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police 
 according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and of the code of criminal examination i am the judge 
 i order that this woman shall be set at liberty 
 javert ventured to make a final effort 
 but mr mayor 
 i refer you to article of the law of the th of december in regard to arbitrary detention 
 monsieur le maire permit me 
 not another word 
 but 
 leave the room said m madeleine 
 javert received the blow erect full in the face in his breast like a russian soldier 
 he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room 
 fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed 
 nevertheless she also was the prey to a strange confusion 
 she had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers she had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty her life her soul her child in combat before her very eyes one of these men was drawing her towards darkness the other was leading her back towards the light 
 in this conflict viewed through the exaggerations of terror these two men had appeared to her like two giants the one spoke like her demon the other like her good angel the angel had conquered the demon and strange to say that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man whom she abhorred that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes that madeleine and at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion he had saved her 
 had she then been mistaken must she change her whole soul 
 she did not know she trembled she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and at every word uttered by m madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her and something warm and ineffable indescribable which was both joy confidence and love dawn in her heart 
 when javert had taken his departure m madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking 
 i have heard you 
 i knew nothing about what you have mentioned i believe that it is true and i feel that it is true 
 i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop 
 why did you not apply to me 
 but here i will pay your debts i will send for your child or you shall go to her 
 you shall live here in paris or where you please 
 i undertake the care of your child and yourself 
 you shall not work any longer if you do not like 
 i will give all the money you require 
 you shall be honest and happy once more 
 and listen i declare to you that if all is as you i do not doubt it you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of god oh poor woman 
 this was more than fantine could bear 
 to have cosette 
 to leave this life of infamy 
 to live free rich happy respectable with cosette to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery 
 she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her and could only give vent to two or three sobs oh 
 oh 
 oh 
 her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m madeleine and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it 
 then she fainted

 book three 
 chapter iv 
 
 when princess mary came down prince vasili and his son were already in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess indicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince face serious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on the visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasili approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still could not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all anatole was not nor ready or eloquent in conversation but he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable if a man lacking in remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly examined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him talk but i want to he seemed to say besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even love a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was was as if he said to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think this when he met women even probably he did not for in general he thought very little but his looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation was general and animated thanks to princess voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some jokes and amusing reminiscences though no such reminiscences really exist just as none existed in this case prince vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences 
 here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in french to prince vasili not as at receptions where you always ran away you remember cette chere annette 
 anna pavlovna 
 ah but you talk politics to me like annette 
 and our little tea table 
 oh yes 
 why is it you were never at the little princess asked anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger at him i have even heard of your doings in paris 
 and hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning to his son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary 
 when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections 
 she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when married la petite est gentille 
 the little one is charming 
 the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are prince vasili and that son of his to me prince vasili is a shallow braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain lise married to andrew a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays but is she contented with her lot and who would marry marie for love plain and awkward take her for her connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while dressing and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer prince vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer his birth and position in society were not bad well nothing against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her and that is what we shall see 
 that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloud 
 he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress mademoiselle ribbon princess unbecoming coiffure mademoiselle and smiles and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a fool he thought looking irritably at her she is shameless and he ignores her 
 he went straight up to prince vasili 
 well how do how do glad to see you 
 friendship laughs at distance began prince vasili in his usual rapid familiar tone here is my second son please love and befriend him 
 prince bolkonski surveyed anatole 
 fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and kiss me and he offered his cheek 
 anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect 
 prince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princess mary 
 and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating prince last words then rising he suddenly went up to his daughter 
 is it for visitors got yourself up like that eh said he fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent 
 it was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with a blush 
 you must do as you please said prince bolkonski bowing to his but she need not make a fool of herself plain enough as it is 
 and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was reduced to tears 
 on the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said prince vasili 
 now you young prince your name said prince bolkonski turning to anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted 
 now the fun begins thought anatole sitting down with a smile beside the old prince 
 well my dear boy i hear been educated abroad not taught to read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me my dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the old man scrutinizing anatole closely and intently 
 no i have been transferred to the line said anatole hardly able to restrain his laughter 
 ah a good thing so my dear boy you wish to serve the tsar and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow must serve well are you off to the front 
 no prince our regiment has gone to the front but i am attached what is it i am attached to papa said anatole turning to his father with a laugh 
 a splendid soldier splendid what am i attached to ha ha ha laughed prince bolkonski and anatole laughed still louder suddenly prince bolkonski frowned 
 you may go he said to anatole 
 anatole returned smiling to the ladies 
 and so had him educated abroad prince vasili you said the old prince to prince vasili 
 i have done my best for him and i can assure you the education there is much better than ours 
 yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed the a fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now he took prince arm and led him to his study as soon as they were alone together prince vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince 
 well do you think i shall prevent her that i part from her said the old prince angrily what an idea ready for it tomorrow only let me tell you i want to know my better you know my principles everything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow in your presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay and see the old prince snorted let her marry all the same to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son 
 i will tell you frankly said prince vasili in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so companion you know you see right through people anatole is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son or kinsman 
 all right all right see 
 as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society on appearance all the three women of prince household felt that their life had not been real till then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance 
 princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly and magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and tried to conceal them 
 but am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do not like him 
 and princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new guest poor girl devilish ugly thought anatole 
 mademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young woman without any definite position without relations or even a country did not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski to reading aloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoiselle bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed ungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her off and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she liked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had been seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince had appeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle head at the very time she was talking to anatole about paris it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar to her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible 
 the little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any struggle but with naive and lighthearted gaiety 
 although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women besides that he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions 
 after tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spirits came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoiselle bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her but to the movements of mademoiselle little foot which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess 
 how she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband can it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face but still feeling his eyes gazing at her 
 in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole kissed princess hand she did not know how she found the courage but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle hand this was not etiquette but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle bourienne flushed and gave the princess a frightened look 
 what delicacy thought the princess is it possible that amelie mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her and not value her pure affection and devotion to me she went up to her and kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand 
 no no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the flax 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the flax was in full bloom it had pretty little blue flowers as 
 delicate as the wings of a moth or even more so the sun shone and 
 the showers watered it and this was just as good for the flax as it 
 is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mother 
 they look much prettier for it and so did the flax 
 
 people say that i look exceedingly well said the flax and 
 that i am so fine and long that i shall make a beautiful piece of 
 linen how fortunate i am it makes me so happy it is such a pleasant 
 thing to know that something can be made of me how the sunshine 
 cheers me and how sweet and refreshing is the rain my happiness 
 overpowers me no one in the world can feel happier than i am 
 
 ah yes no doubt said the fern but you do not know the world 
 yet as well as i do for my sticks are knotty and then it sung quite 
 mournfully 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lurre 
 the song is ended 
 no it is not ended said the flax the sun will 
 shine or the rain descend i feel that i am growing i feel that i am 
 in full blossom i am the happiest of all creatures 
 
 well one day some people came who took hold of the flax and 
 pulled it up by the roots this was painful then it was laid in water 
 as if they intended to drown it and after that placed near a fire 
 as if it were to be roasted all this was very shocking we cannot 
 expect to be happy always said the flax by experiencing evil as 
 well as good we become wise and certainly there was plenty of 
 evil in store for the flax it was steeped and roasted and broken 
 and combed indeed it scarcely knew what was done to it at last it 
 was put on the spinning wheel whirr whirr went the wheel so 
 quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts well i have 
 been very happy he thought in the midst of his pain and must be 
 contented with the past and contented he remained till he was put on 
 the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen all the flax 
 even to the last stalk was used in making this one piece well this 
 is quite wonderful i could not have believed that i should be so 
 favored by fortune the fern was not wrong with its song of 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lurre 
 but the song is not ended yet i am sure it is only just beginning 
 how wonderful it is that after all i have suffered i am made 
 something of at last i am the luckiest person in the world so strong 
 and fine and how white and what a length this is something 
 different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers then i had no 
 attention nor any water unless it rained now i am watched and taken 
 care of every morning the maid turns me over and i have a 
 from the every evening yes and the 
 wife noticed me and said i was the best piece of linen in 
 the whole parish i cannot be happier than i am now 
 
 after some time the linen was taken into the house placed 
 under the scissors and cut and torn into pieces and then pricked 
 with needles this certainly was not pleasant but at last it was made 
 into twelve garments of that kind which people do not like to name 
 and yet everybody should wear one see now then said the flax i have become something of importance this was my destiny it is 
 quite a blessing now i shall be of some use in the world as everyone 
 ought to be it is the only way to be happy i am now divided into 
 twelve pieces and yet we are all one and the same in the whole dozen 
 it is most extraordinary good fortune 
 
 years passed away and at last the linen was so worn it could 
 scarcely hold together it must end very soon said the pieces to 
 each other we would gladly have held together a little longer but 
 it is useless to expect impossibilities and at length they fell into 
 rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them for they were 
 torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried 
 and they knew not what besides till all at once they found themselves 
 beautiful white paper well now this is a surprise a glorious 
 surprise too said the paper i am now finer than ever and i 
 shall be written upon and who can tell what fine things i may have 
 written upon me this is wonderful luck and sure enough the most 
 beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it and only once was 
 there a blot which was very fortunate then people heard the 
 stories and poetry read and it made them wiser and better for all 
 that was written had a good and sensible meaning and a great blessing was contained in the words on this paper 
 
 i never imagined anything like this said the paper when i was 
 only a little blue flower growing in the fields how could i fancy 
 that i should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to 
 man i cannot understand it myself and yet it is really so heaven 
 knows that i have done nothing myself but what i was obliged to do 
 with my weak powers for my own preservation and yet i have been 
 promoted from one joy and honor to another each time i think that the song is ended and then something higher and better begins for me i suppose now i shall be sent on my travels about the world so that people may read me it cannot be otherwise indeed it is more than probable for i have more splendid thoughts written upon me than i had pretty flowers in olden times i am happier than ever 
 
 but the paper did not go on its travels it was sent to the 
 printer and all the words written upon it were set up in type to 
 make a book or rather many hundreds of books for so many more 
 persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than 
 from the written paper and if the paper had been sent around the 
 world it would have been worn out before it had got half through 
 its journey 
 
 this is certainly the wisest plan said the written paper i 
 really did not think of that i shall remain at home and be held in 
 honor like some old grandfather as i really am to all these new 
 books they will do some good i could not have wandered about as they do yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface i am the most honored of all 
 
 then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and 
 thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse 
 
 after work it is well to rest said the paper and a very good 
 opportunity to collect thoughts now i am able for the first 
 time to think of my real condition and to know self is true 
 progress what will be done with me now i wonder no doubt i shall still go forward i have always progressed hitherto as i know quite well 
 
 now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken 
 out and laid on the hearth to be burnt people said it could not be 
 sold at the shop to wrap up butter and sugar because it had been 
 written upon the children in the house stood round the stove for 
 they wanted to see the paper burn because it flamed up so prettily 
 and afterwards among the ashes so many red sparks could be seen 
 running one after the other here and there as quick as the wind 
 
 they called it seeing the children come out of school and the last 
 spark was the schoolmaster they often thought the last spark had 
 come and one would cry there goes the schoolmaster but the next moment another spark would appear shining so beautifully how they would like to know where the sparks all went to perhaps we shall find out some day but we know now 
 
 the whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was 
 soon alight ugh cried the paper as it burst into a bright 
 flame ugh it was certainly not very pleasant to be burning but 
 when the whole was wrapped in flames the flames mounted up into the air higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little 
 blue flower and they glistened as the white linen never could have 
 glistened all the written letters became quite red in a moment and 
 all the words and thoughts turned to fire 
 
 now i am mounting straight up to the sun said a voice in the 
 flames and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words and the 
 flames darted up through the chimney and went out at the top then 
 a number of tiny beings as many in number as the flowers on the 
 flax had been and invisible to mortal eyes floated above them 
 
 they were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from which 
 they were born and as the flames were extinguished and nothing 
 remained of the paper but black ashes these little beings danced upon 
 it and whenever they touched it bright red sparks appeared 
 
 the children are all out of school and the schoolmaster was 
 the last of all said the children it was good fun and they sang 
 over the dead ashes 
 snip snap snurre 
 basse lure 
 the song is ended 
 but the little invisible beings said the song is never ended 
 the most beautiful is yet to come 
 
 but the children could neither hear nor understand this nor 
 should they for children must not know everything

 of vainglory 
 it was prettily devised of aesop the fly sat upon the of the chariot wheel 
 and said what a dust do i raise 
 so are there some vain persons that whatsoever goeth alone or moveth upon greater means if they have never so little hand in it they think it is they that carry it they that are glorious must needs be factious for all bravery stands upon comparisons they must needs be violent to make good their own vaunts neither can they be secret and therefore not effectual but according to die french proverb beaucoup de bruit peu de fruit much bruit little fruit yet certainly there is use of this quality in civil affairs 
 where there is an opinion and fame to be created either of virtue or greatness these men are good trumpeters again as titus livius noteth in the case of antiochus and the aetolians there are sometimes great effects of cross lies as if a man that negotiates between two princes to draw them to join in a war against the third doth extol the forces of either of them above measure the one to the other and sometimes he that deals between man and man raiseth his own credit with both by pretending greater interest than he hath in either and in these and the like kinds it often falls out that somewhat is produced of nothing for lies are sufficient to breed opinion and opinion brings on substance in military commanders and soldiers vainglory is an essential point for as iron sharpens iron so by glory one courage sharpeneth another in cases of great enterprise upon charge and adventure a composition of glorious natures doth put life into business and those mat are of solid and sober natures have more of the ballast than of the sail in fame of learning the flight will be slow without some feathers of ostentation qui de contenmenda gloria libros scribunt nomen suum inscribunt socrates aristotle galen were men firil of ostentation 
 certainly vainglory helpeth to perpetuate a memory and virtue was never so beholding to human nature as it received his due at the second hand neither had the fame of cicero seneca plinius secundus borne her age so well if it had not been joined with some vanity in themselves like unto varnish that makes sealings not only shine but last but all this while when i speak of vainglory i mean not of that property that tacitus doth attribute to mucianus omnium quae chxerat jeceratque arte quadam ostentator for that proceeds not of vanity but of natural magnanimity and discretion and in some persons is not only comely but gracious 
 for excusations cessions modesty itself well governed are but arts of ostentation and amongst those arts there is none better than that which plinius secundus speaketh of which is to be liberal of praise and commendation to others in that wherein a self hath any perfection for saith pliny very wittily in commending another you do your self right for he that you commend is either superior to you in that you commend or inferior 
 
 if he be inferior if he be to be commended you much more if he be superior if 
 he be not to be commended you much less glorious men are the scorn of wise men the admiration of fools the idols of parasites and the slaves of their own vaunts

 chapter i 
 
 the beginning of repose 
 m madeleine had fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house 
 he confided her to the sisters who put her to bed 
 a burning fever had come on 
 she passed a part of the night in delirium and raving 
 at length however she fell asleep 
 on the morrow towards midday fantine awoke 
 she heard some one breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and saw m madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head his gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication 
 she followed its direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall 
 thenceforth m madeleine was transfigured in eyes 
 he seemed to her to be clothed in light 
 he was absorbed in a sort of prayer she gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him at last she said timidly 
 what are you doing 
 m madeleine had been there for an hour 
 he had been waiting for fantine to awake 
 he took her hand felt of her pulse and replied 
 how do you feel 
 well i have slept she replied i think that i am better it is nothing 
 he answered responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it 
 i was praying to the martyr there on high 
 and he added in his own mind for the martyr here below 
 m madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries 
 he knew all now he knew history in all its details 
 he went on 
 you have suffered much poor mother 
 oh do not complain you now have the dowry of the elect 
 it is thus that men are transformed into angels 
 it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise 
 you see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven 
 it was necessary to begin there 
 he sighed deeply 
 but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking 
 that same night javert wrote a letter 
 the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m sur m it was addressed to paris and the superscription ran 
 to monsieur chabouillet secretary of monsieur le prefet of police 
 as the affair in the had been bruited about the and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off and who recognized handwriting on the cover thought that he was sending in his resignation 
 made haste to write to the thenardiers 
 fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs 
 he sent them three hundred francs telling them to pay themselves from that sum and to fetch the child instantly to m sur m where her sick mother required her presence 
 this dazzled thenardier 
 the devil said the man to his wife allow the child to go 
 this lark is going to turn into a milch cow 
 i see through it 
 some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother 
 he replied with a very well bill for five hundred and some odd francs 
 in this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred for the doctor the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked eponine and azelma through two long illnesses 
 cosette as we have already said had not been ill it was only a question of a trifling substitution of names at the foot of the memorandum thenardier wrote received on account three hundred francs 
 m madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote make haste to bring cosette 
 christi said thenardier not give up the child 
 in the meantime fantine did not recover 
 she still remained in the infirmary 
 the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman with repugnance 
 those who have seen the of rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins 
 the ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion 
 but in a few days fantine disarmed them she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness 
 one day the sisters heard her say amid her fever 
 i have been a sinner but when i have my child beside me it will be a sign that god has pardoned me while i was leading a bad life i should not have liked to have my cosette with me i could not have borne her sad astonished eyes it was for her sake that i did evil and that is why god pardons me i shall feel the benediction of the good god when cosette is here i shall gaze at her it will do me good to see that innocent creature she knows nothing at all 
 she is an angel you see my sisters at that age the wings have not fallen off 
 m madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him 
 shall i see my cosette soon 
 he answered 
 perhaps 
 she may arrive at any moment 
 i am expecting her 
 and the pale face grew radiant 
 oh she said how happy i am going to be 
 we have just said that she did not recover her health 
 on the contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last at that time people were beginning to follow the fine fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies the doctor sounded chest and shook his head 
 m madeleine said to the doctor 
 well 
 has she not a child which she desires to see said the doctor 
 yes 
 well 
 make haste and get it here 
 
 m madeleine shuddered 
 fantine inquired 
 what did the doctor say 
 m madeleine forced himself to smile 
 he said that your child was to be brought speedily 
 that that would restore your health 
 oh she rejoined he is right 
 but what do those thenardiers mean by keeping my cosette from me 
 oh she is coming 
 at last i behold happiness close beside me 
 in the meantime thenardier did not let go of the child and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it 
 cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter 
 and then there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood and they were collecting the bills for them etc etc 
 i shall send some one to fetch cosette said father madeleine if necessary i will go myself 
 he wrote the following letter to dictation and made her sign it 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 in the meantime a serious incident occurred 
 carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it

 book three 
 chapter v 
 
 they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed all kept awake a long time that night 
 is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes kind that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner and this someone was he the devil and he was also this man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips 
 she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room 
 mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall 
 the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time muttering to herself 
 i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated i should be glad enough to fall asleep so not my fault and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry 
 the old prince did not sleep either tikhon half asleep heard him pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but instead of that he only excited himself more and more 
 the first man that turns up she forgets her father and everything else runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice it fr fr fr and i see that that idiot had eyes only for bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but let her see 
 the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne princess would be wounded and his point not to be parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this thought he called tikhon and began to undress 
 what devil brought them here thought he while tikhon was putting the nightshirt over his old body and chest i never invited them they came to disturb my life and there is not much of it left 
 devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the shirt 
 tikhon knew his habit of sometimes thinking aloud and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt 
 gone to bed asked the prince 
 tikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince vasili and his son 
 they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency 
 no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he went to the couch on which he slept 
 though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary went to her room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne and anatole met in the conservatory 
 princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it she read this in face and in that of prince valet who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water 
 the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking expression of her his face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her repeating in a low voice the same words several times over 
 he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously 
 i have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an unnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasili has not come and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince bolkonski referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyes last night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know my principles i refer it to you 
 how am i to understand you mon pere said the princess growing pale and then blushing 
 how understand me cried her father angrily prince vasili finds you to his taste as a and makes a proposal to you on his behalf how to be understood how understand it and i ask you 
 i do not know what you think father whispered the princess 
 i i what of me leave me out of the question not going to get married what about you what i want to know 
 the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to submit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if i had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the old prince interrupted her 
 admirable he shouted he will take you with your dowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain be the wife while you 
 the prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears 
 now then now then only joking he said remember this princess i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose i give you freedom only remember that your happiness depends on your decision never mind me 
 but i do not know father 
 no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry you or anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it over and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no i know you will pray over it well pray if you like but you had better think it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted when the princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the study 
 her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing anything when suddenly the whispering of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with a horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle bourienne who had not yet seen her 
 that why wait a moment face seemed to say princess mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it at last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments 
 an hour later tikhon came to call princess mary to the old prince he added that prince vasili was also there when tikhon came to her princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle pretty face 
 no princess i have lost your affection forever said mademoiselle bourienne 
 why i love you more than ever said princess mary and i will try to do all i can for your happiness 
 but you despise me you who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion oh only my poor mother 
 i quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile calm yourself my dear i will go to my father she said and went out 
 prince vasili with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as if stirred to his core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff 
 ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both hands then sighing he added my fate is in your hands decide my dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a daughter 
 he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye 
 fr fr snorted prince bolkonski the prince is making a proposition to you in his i mean his name do you wish or not to be prince anatole wife reply yes or no he shouted and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also yes my opinion and only my opinion added prince bolkonski turning to prince vasili and answering his imploring look yes or no 
 my desire is never to leave you father never to separate my life from yours i wish to marry she answered positively glancing at prince vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes 
 humbug nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolkonski frowning and taking his hand he did not kiss her but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry 
 prince vasili rose 
 my dear i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never never forget but my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so long say perhaps 
 prince what i have said is all there is in my heart i thank you for the honor but i shall never be your wife 
 well so finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have seen you very glad go back to your rooms princess go said the old prince very very glad to glad to have seen you repeated he embracing prince vasili 
 my vocation is a different one thought princess mary my vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of love and and cost what it may i will arrange poor happiness she loves him so passionately and so passionately repents i will do all i can to arrange the match between them if he is not rich i will give her the means i will ask my father and andrew i shall be so happy when she is his wife she is so unfortunate a stranger alone helpless and oh god how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself perhaps i might have done the same thought princess mary

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the flying trunk 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street with gold and would even then have had enough for a small alley but he did not do so he knew the value of money better than to use it in this way so clever was he that every shilling he put out brought him a crown and so he continued till he died his son inherited his wealth and he lived a merry life with it he went to a masquerade every night made kites out of five pound notes and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones making ducks and drakes of them in this manner he soon lost all his money 
 at last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers an old and four shillings and now all his friends deserted him they could not walk with him in the streets but one of them who was very 
 sent him an old trunk with this message pack up 
 yes he said it is all very well to say pack up but he had 
 nothing left to pack up therefore he seated himself in the trunk 
 it was a very wonderful trunk no sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly he shut the lid and pressed the lock when away flew the trunk up the chimney with the son in it right up into the clouds whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked he was in a great fright for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees however he got safely in his trunk to the land of turkey he hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves and then went into the town he could so this very well for the turks always go about dressed in and slippers as he was himself he happened to meet a nurse with a little child i say you turkish nurse cried he what castle is that near the town with the windows placed so high 
 
 the daughter lives there she replied it has been 
 prophesied that she will be very unhappy about a lover and 
 therefore no one is allowed to visit her unless the king and queen 
 are present 
 
 thank you said the son so he went back to the wood 
 seated himself in his trunk flew up to the roof of the castle and 
 crept through the window into the room she lay on the sofa asleep and she was so beautiful that the son could not help kissing her then she awoke and was very much frightened but he told her he was a turkish angel who had come down through the air to see her which pleased her very much he sat down by her side and talked to her he said her eyes were like beautiful dark lakes in which the thoughts swam about like little mermaids and he told her 
 that her forehead was a snowy mountain which contained splendid halls full of pictures and then he related to her about the stork who 
 brings the beautiful children from the rivers these were delightful 
 stories and when he asked the princess if she would marry him she 
 consented immediately 
 
 but you must come on saturday she said for then the king 
 and queen will take tea with me they will be very proud when they 
 find that i am going to marry a turkish angel but you must think of 
 some very pretty stories to tell them for my parents like to hear 
 stories better than anything my mother prefers one that is deep and 
 moral but my father likes something funny to make him laugh 
 
 very well he replied i shall bring you no other marriage 
 portion than a story and so they parted but the princess gave him a 
 sword which was studded with gold coins and these he could use 
 then he flew away to the town and bought a new 
 and afterwards returned to the wood where he composed a story so 
 as to be ready for saturday which was no easy matter it was ready 
 however by saturday when he went to see the princess the king and queen and the whole court were at tea with the princess and he 
 was received with great politeness 
 
 will you tell us a story said the queen one that is 
 instructive and full of deep learning 
 
 yes but with something in it to laugh at said the king 
 
 certainly he replied and commenced at once asking them to 
 listen attentively there was once a bundle of matches that were 
 exceedingly proud of their high descent their genealogical tree that 
 is a large from which they had been cut was at one time 
 a large old tree in the wood the matches now lay between a 
 and an old iron saucepan and were talking about their 
 youthful days ah then we grew on the green boughs and were as 
 green as they every morning and evening we were fed with diamond 
 drops of dew whenever the sun shone we felt his warm rays and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung we knew that 
 we were rich for the other trees only wore their green dress in 
 summer but our family were able to array themselves in green 
 summer and winter but the came like a great 
 revolution and our family fell under the axe the head of the house 
 obtained a situation as mainmast in a very fine ship and can sail 
 round the world when he will the other branches of the family were 
 taken to different places and our office now is to kindle a light for 
 common people this is how such people as we came to be in a kitchen 
 
 mine has been a very different fate said the iron pot which 
 stood by the matches from my first entrance into the world i have 
 been used to cooking and scouring i am the first in this house 
 when anything solid or useful is required my only pleasure is to be 
 made clean and shining after dinner and to sit in my place and have a 
 little sensible conversation with my neighbors all of us excepting 
 the which is sometimes taken into the courtyard live 
 here together within these four walls we get our news from the 
 but he sometimes tells us very unpleasant things 
 about the people and the government yes and one day an old pot was so alarmed that he fell down and was broken to pieces he was a liberal i can tell you 
 
 you are talking too much said the and the steel 
 struck against the flint till some sparks flew out crying we want a 
 merry evening we 
 
 yes of course said the matches let us talk about those 
 who are the highest born 
 
 no i like to be always talking of what we are remarked the saucepan let us think of some other amusement i will begin we will tell something that has happened to ourselves that will be very easy and interesting as well on the baltic sea near the danish shore 
 
 what a pretty commencement said the plates we shall all 
 like that story i am sure 
 
 yes well in my youth i lived in a quiet family where the 
 furniture was polished the floors scoured and clean curtains put 
 up every fortnight 
 
 what an interesting way you have of relating a story said 
 the it is easy to perceive that you have been a great 
 deal in society there is something so pure runs through 
 what you say 
 
 that is quite true said the and he made a spring 
 with joy and splashed some water on the floor 
 
 then the saucepan went on with his story and the end was as good 
 as the beginning 
 
 the plates rattled with pleasure and the brought 
 some green parsley out of the and crowned the saucepan 
 for he knew it would vex the others and he thought if i crown him 
 he will crown me 
 
 now let us have a dance said the and then how 
 they danced and stuck up one leg in the air the in 
 the corner burst with laughter when she saw it 
 
 shall i be crowned now asked the so the broom 
 found another wreath for the tongs 
 
 they were only common people after all thought the matches 
 the was now asked to sing but she said she had a cold and 
 could not sing without boiling heat they all thought this was 
 affectation and because she did not wish to sing excepting in the 
 parlor when on the table with the grand people 
 
 in the window sat an old with which the maid generally 
 wrote there was nothing remarkable about the pen excepting that it 
 had been dipped too deeply in the ink but it was proud of that 
 
 if the sing said the pen she can leave it alone there is a nightingale in a cage who can sing she has not been taught much certainly but we need not say anything this evening about that 
 
 i think it highly improper said the who was kitchen singer and to the that a rich foreign bird should be listened to here is it patriotic let the decide what is right 
 
 i certainly am vexed said the basket inwardly vexed more 
 than any one can imagine are we spending the evening properly 
 would it not be more sensible to put the house in order if each 
 were in his own place i would lead a game this would be quite another thing 
 
 let us act a play said they all at the same moment the door 
 opened and the maid came in then not one stirred they all 
 remained quite still yet at the same time there was not a single 
 pot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself and of what he could do if he chose 
 
 yes if we had chosen they each thought we might have 
 spent a very pleasant evening 
 
 the maid took the matches and lighted them dear me how they 
 sputtered and blazed up 
 
 now then they thought every one will see that we are the 
 first how we shine what a light we give even while they spoke 
 their light went out 
 
 what a capital story said the queen i feel as if i were 
 really in the kitchen and could see the matches yes you shall marry 
 our daughter 
 
 certainly said the king thou shalt have our daughter the 
 king said thou to him because he was going to be one of the family 
 the was fixed and on the evening before the whole 
 city was illuminated cakes and sweetmeats were thrown among the 
 people the street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted hurrah and 
 whistled between their fingers altogether it was a very splendid 
 affair 
 
 i will give them another treat said the son so he 
 went and bought rockets and crackers and all sorts of that 
 could be thought of packed them in his trunk and flew up with it 
 into the air what a whizzing and popping they made as they went 
 off the turks when they saw such a sight in the air jumped so 
 high that their slippers flew about their ears it was easy to believe 
 after this that the princess was really going to marry a turkish 
 angel 
 
 as soon as the son had come down in his flying trunk to 
 the wood after the fireworks he thought i will go back into the 
 town now and hear what they think of the entertainment it was 
 very natural that he should wish to know and what strange things 
 people did say to be sure every one whom he questioned had a 
 different tale to tell though they all thought it very beautiful 
 
 i saw the turkish angel myself said one he had eyes like 
 glittering stars and a head like foaming water 
 
 he flew in a mantle of fire cried another and lovely little 
 cherubs peeped out from the folds 
 
 he heard many more fine things about himself and that the next 
 day he was to be married after this he went back to the forest to 
 rest himself in his trunk it had disappeared a spark from the 
 fireworks which remained had set it on fire it was burnt to ashes so 
 the son could not fly any more nor go to meet his bride 
 she stood all day on the roof waiting for him and most likely she 
 is waiting there still while he wanders through the world telling 
 fairy tales but none of them so amusing as the one he related about 
 the matches

 of honour reputation 
 the winning of honour is but the revealing of a virtue and worth without 
 disadvantage for some in their actions do woo and affect honour and reputation 
 which sort of men are commonly much talked of but inwardly little admired and some contrariwise darken their virtue in the show of it so as they be undervalued in opinion if a man perform that which hath not been attempted before or attempted and given over or ham been achieved but not with so good circumstance he shall purchase more honour than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue wherein he is but a follower if a man so temper his actions as in some one of them he doth content every faction or combination of people the music will be the fuller 
 
 a man is an ill husband of his honour that entereth into any action the failing 
 wherein may disgrace him more than the carrying of it through can honour him honour that is gained and broken upon another hath the quickest reflection like diamonds cut with facets 
 and therefore let a man contend to excel any competitors of his in honour in them if he can in their own bow discreet followers and servants help much to reputation onuus farm a danestids emanat envy which is me 
 canker of honour is best extinguished by declaring a self in his ends rather 
 to seek merit man fame and by attributing a successes rather to divine 
 providence and felicity than to his own virtue or policy the true marshalling of 
 the degrees of sovereign honour are these in the first place are concstorvsynperionan founders of states and commonwealths such as were romulus cyrus caesar ottoman ismael in the second place are kgidttones lawgivers which are also called second founders or papead prindpes because they govern by their ordinances after they are gone such were lycurgus 
 solon justinian eadgar alphonsus of castile the wise that made the siete parados 
 
 in the third place are or sahcams such as compound the long miseries of civil wars or deliver their countries from servitude of strangers or tyrants as 
 augustus caesar vespasianus aurelianus theodoricus henry vh of england and henry iv of france in me fourth place are or prnpugnatores imperil such as in honourable wars enlarge their territories or make noble defence against invaders 
 and in the last place are patres patriae which reign justly and make the times good wherein they live both which last kinds need no examples they are in such number 
 degrees of honour in subjects are first paihapes cwarwn those upon whom princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs their right hands as we call them 
 the next are duces bes great leaders such as are princes lieutenants and do them notable services in the wars the third are arias favourites such as exceed not this scantling to be solace to the sovereign and harmless to the people and the fourth negotas pares such as have great places under princes and execute their places with sufficiency 
 
 there is an honour likewise which may be ranked amongst the greatest which happeneth rarely that is of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of their country as was m regulus and the two decii

 chapter ii 
 
 how jean may become champ 
 one morning m madeleine was in his study occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the office in case he should decide to take the trip to montfermeil when he was informed that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him 
 madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name 
 javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the and m madeleine had not seen him 
 admit him he said 
 javert entered 
 m madeleine had retained his seat near the fire pen in hand his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations 
 he did not disturb himself on account 
 he could not help thinking of poor fantine and it suited him to be glacial in his manner 
 javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor whose back was turned to him 
 the mayor did not look at him but went on annotating this docket 
 javert advanced two or three paces into the study and halted without breaking the silence 
 if any physiognomist who had been familiar with javert and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the corporal this spy who was incapable of a lie this unspotted police any physiognomist had known his secret and aversion for m madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject of fantine and had examined javert at that moment he would have said to himself what has taken place it was evident to any one acquainted with that clear upright sincere honest austere and ferocious conscience that javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle 
 javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance 
 like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling on entering he bowed to m madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor anger nor distrust he halted a few paces in the rear of the and there he stood perfectly erect in an attitude almost of discipline with the cold ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient he waited without uttering a word without making a movement in genuine humility and tranquil resignation calm serious hat in hand with eyes cast down and an expression which was between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge until it should please the mayor to turn round 
 all the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared 
 that face as impenetrable and simple as granite no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression 
 his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency 
 at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round 
 well 
 what is it 
 what is the matter javert 
 javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not however preclude simplicity 
 this is the matter mr mayor a culpable act has been committed 
 what act 
 an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the gravest manner towards a magistrate 
 i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge as it is my duty to do 
 who is the agent asked m madeleine 
 i said javert 
 you 
 i 
 and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent 
 you mr mayor 
 m madeleine sat erect in his javert went on with a severe air and his eyes still cast down 
 mr mayor i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me 
 m madeleine opened his mouth in amazement 
 javert interrupted him 
 you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does not suffice 
 handing in resignation is honorable i have failed in my duty i ought to be punished i must be turned out 
 and after a pause he added 
 mr mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly be so with justice 
 come now 
 why exclaimed m madeleine 
 what nonsense is this what is the meaning of this 
 what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me 
 what have you done to me 
 what are your wrongs with regard to me 
 you accuse yourself you wish to be superseded 
 turned out said javert 
 turned out so it be then 
 that is well 
 i do not understand 
 you shall understand mr mayor 
 javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resumed still coldly and sadly 
 mr mayor six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman i was furious and i informed against you 
 informed against me 
 at the prefecture of police in paris 
 m madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than javert himself burst out laughing now 
 as a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police 
 as an 
 the mayor turned livid 
 javert who had not raised his eyes went on 
 i thought it was so 
 i had had an idea for a long time a resemblance inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles the strength of your loins the adventure with old fauchelevant your skill in marksmanship your leg which you drag a little i hardly know what 
 but at all events i took you for a certain jean valjean 
 a did you say the name was 
 jean valjean 
 he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago when i was of convicts at toulon on leaving the galleys this jean valjean as it appears robbed a bishop then he committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public highway on the person of a little savoyard 
 he disappeared eight years ago no one knows how and he has been sought i fancied in short i did this thing 
 wrath impelled me i denounced you at the prefecture 
 m madeleine who had taken up the docket again several moments before this resumed with an air of perfect indifference 
 and what reply did you receive 
 that i was mad 
 well 
 well they were right 
 it is lucky that you recognize the fact 
 i am forced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found 
 the sheet of paper which m madeleine was holding dropped from his hand he raised his head gazed fixedly at javert and said with his indescribable accent 
 ah 
 javert continued 
 this is the way it is mr mayor 
 it seems that there was in the neighborhood near an old fellow who was called father champmathieu 
 he was a very wretched creature no one paid any attention to him 
 no one knows what such people subsist on 
 lately last autumn father champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples no matter a theft had been committed a wall scaled branches of trees broken my champmathieu was arrested 
 he still had the branch of in his hand 
 the scamp is locked up 
 up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor 
 but here is where providence intervened 
 the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer champmathieu to arras where the departmental prison is situated 
 in this prison at arras there is an named brevet who is detained for i know not what and who has been appointed turnkey of the house because of good behavior mr mayor no sooner had champmathieu arrived than brevet exclaims eh why i know that man 
 he is a fagot take a good look at me my good man 
 you are jean valjean 
 jean valjean jean valjean champmathieu feigns astonishment 
 play the innocent dodge says brevet 
 you are jean valjean 
 you have been in the galleys of toulon it was twenty years ago we were there together champmathieu denies it 
 parbleu 
 you understand 
 the case is investigated 
 the thing was well ventilated for me 
 this is what they discovered 
 this champmathieu had been thirty years ago a pruner of trees in various localities notably at faverolles there all trace of him was lost 
 a long time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne then in paris where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that has not been proved 
 now before going to the galleys for theft what was jean valjean 
 a pruner of trees 
 where 
 at faverolles another fact 
 this christian name was jean and his surname was mathieu 
 what more natural to suppose than that on emerging from the galleys he should have taken his name for the purpose of concealing himself and have called himself jean mathieu 
 he goes to auvergne 
 the local pronunciation turns jean into is called chan mathieu 
 our man offers no opposition and behold him transformed into champmathieu 
 you follow me do you not 
 inquiries were made at faverolles 
 the family of jean valjean is no longer there 
 it is not known where they have gone you know that among those classes a family often disappears search was made and nothing was found 
 when such people are not mud they are dust 
 and then as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back there is no longer any one at faverolles who knew jean valjean 
 inquiries were made at toulon 
 besides brevet there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean they are cochepaille and chenildieu and are sentenced for life they are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended champmathieu 
 they do not hesitate he is jean valjean for them as well as for brevet 
 the same is the same height the same air the same man in short it is he it was precisely at this moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris 
 i was told that i had lost my reason and that jean valjean is at arras in the power of the authorities you can imagine whether this surprised me when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here 
 i write to the examining judge he sends for me champmathieu is conducted to me 
 an 
 well interposed m madeleine 
 javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy as ever 
 mr mayor the truth is the truth 
 i am sorry but that man is jean valjean 
 i recognized him also 
 m madeleine resumed in a very low voice 
 you are sure 
 javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction 
 o 
 sure 
 he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table and he added 
 and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean i do not see how i could have thought otherwise 
 i beg your pardon mr mayor 
 javert as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole and bade him leave the that haughty man was unconsciously full of simplicity and madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question 
 and what does this man say 
 ah 
 indeed mr mayor a bad business 
 if he is jean valjean he has his previous conviction against him 
 to climb a wall to break a branch to purloin apples is a mischievous trick in a child for a man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime robbing and is all there 
 it is no longer a question of correctional police it is a matter for the court of assizes it is no longer a matter of a few days in prison it is the galleys for life 
 and then there is the affair with the little savoyard who will return i hope 
 the deuce there is plenty to dispute in the matter is there not 
 yes for any one but jean valjean but jean valjean is a sly dog 
 that is the way i recognized him any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry kettle sings before the fire he would not be jean valjean et cetera 
 but he has not the appearance of understanding he says i am champmathieu and i depart from that 
 he has an astonished air he pretends to be stupid it is far better 
 oh the rogue is clever 
 but it makes no difference the proofs are there 
 he has been recognized by four persons the old scamp will be condemned 
 the case has been taken to the assizes at arras 
 i shall go there to give my testimony 
 i have been summoned 
 m madeleine had turned to his desk again and taken up his docket and was turning over the leaves tranquilly reading and writing by turns like a busy man 
 he turned to javert 
 that will do javert 
 in truth all these details interest me but little 
 we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand 
 javert you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman buseaupied who sells herbs at the corner of the rue you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre chesnelong 
 the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and her child 
 he must be punished 
 you will then go to m charcellay rue he complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges on his premises and is undermining the foundations of his house after that you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the rue guibourg at widow and rue du at madame renee le and you will prepare documents 
 but i am giving you a great deal of work are you not to be absent 
 did you not tell me that you were going to arras on that matter in a week or ten days 
 sooner than that mr mayor 
 on what day then 
 why i thought that i had said to monsieur le maire that the case was to be tried and that i am to set out by diligence 
 m madeleine made an imperceptible movement 
 and how long will the case last 
 one day at the most 
 the judgment will be pronounced evening at latest 
 but i shall not wait for the sentence which is certain i shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken 
 that is well said m madeleine 
 and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand 
 javert did not withdraw 
 excuse me mr mayor said he 
 what is it now demanded m madeleine 
 mr mayor there is still something of which i must remind you 
 what is it 
 that i must be dismissed 
 m madeleine rose 
 javert you are a man of honor and i esteem you 
 you exaggerate your fault 
 moreover this is an offence which concerns me javert you deserve promotion instead of degradation 
 i wish you to retain your post 
 javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible and said in a tranquil voice 
 mr mayor i cannot grant you that 
 i repeat replied m madeleine that the matter concerns me 
 but javert heeding his own thought only continued 
 so far as exaggeration is concerned i am not exaggerating 
 this is the way i reason 
 i have suspected you unjustly 
 that is nothing it is our right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse 
 but without proofs in a fit of rage with the object of wreaking my vengeance i have denounced you as a convict you a respectable man a mayor a magistrate that is serious very serious 
 i have insulted authority in your person i an agent of the authorities 
 if one of my subordinates had done what i have done i should have declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him 
 well 
 stop mr mayor one word more i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others that is just 
 i have done well 
 now if i were not severe towards myself all the justice that i have done would become injustice ought i to spare myself more than others 
 no 
 what 
 i should be good for nothing but to chastise others and not myself 
 why i should be a blackguard 
 those who say that blackguard of a javert would be in the right 
 mr mayor i do not desire that you should treat me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others 
 i want none of it for myself the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is up in the world is what i call false kindness that is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society 
 good god it is very easy to be kind the difficulty lies in being just come if you had been what i thought you i should not have been kind to you not i 
 you would have seen 
 mr mayor i must treat myself as i would treat any other man 
 when i have subdued malefactors when i have proceeded with vigor against rascals i have often said to myself if you flinch if i ever catch you in fault you may rest at your ease 
 i have flinched i have caught myself in a fault so much the worse 
 come discharged cashiered expelled 
 that is well i have arms 
 i will till the soil it makes no difference to me mr mayor the good of the service demands an example 
 i simply require the discharge of inspector javert 
 all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced tone which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man 
 we shall see said m madeleine 
 and he offered him his hand 
 javert recoiled and said in a wild voice 
 excuse me mr mayor but this must not be 
 a mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy 
 he added between his teeth 
 a police spy yes from the moment when i have misused the police i am no more than a police spy 
 then he bowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door 
 there he wheeled round and with eyes still downcast 
 mr mayor he said i shall continue to serve until i am superseded 
 he withdrew 
 m madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm sure step which died away on the pavement of the corridor

 book three 
 chapter vi 
 
 it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the letter 
 anna mikhaylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same time 
 anna mikhaylovna though her circumstances had improved was still living with the rostovs 
 my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to sympathize in any way 
 the count sobbed yet more 
 nikolenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how tell the little countess 
 anna mikhaylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with help would inform her 
 at dinner anna mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about nikolenka twice asked when the last letter had been received from him though she knew that already and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters natasha who of the whole family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and anna mikhaylovna that it had something to do with her brother and that anna mikhaylovna was preparing them for it bold as she was natasha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed head long after anna mikhaylovna and dashing at her flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room 
 auntie darling do tell me what it is 
 nothing my dear 
 no dearest sweet one honey i give up i know you know something 
 anna mikhaylovna shook her head 
 you are a little slyboots she said 
 a letter from nikolenka sure of it exclaimed natasha reading confirmation in anna face 
 but for sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma 
 i will i will only tell me you then i will go and tell at once 
 anna mikhaylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter on condition that she should tell no one 
 no on my true word of honor said herself i tell anyone and she ran off at once to sonya 
 nikolenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful triumph 
 nicholas was all sonya said instantly turning white 
 natasha seeing the impression the of her wound produced on sonya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news 
 she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry 
 a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he wrote himself said she through her tears 
 there now true that all you women are crybabies remarked petya pacing the room with large resolute strides now very glad very glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so you are all blubberers and understand nothing 
 natasha smiled through her tears 
 you read the letter asked sonya 
 no but she said that it was all over and that now an officer 
 thank god said sonya crossing herself but perhaps she deceived you let us go to mamma 
 petya paced the room in silence for a time 
 if been in place i would have killed even more of those frenchmen he said what nasty brutes they are have killed so many that have been a heap of them 
 hold your tongue petya what a goose you are 
 not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said petya 
 do you remember him natasha suddenly asked after a silence 
 sonya smiled 
 do i remember nicholas 
 no sonya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly remember everything said natasha with an expressive gesture evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning i remember nikolenka too i remember him well she said but i remember boris i remember him a bit 
 what you remember boris asked sonya in surprise 
 not that i remember i know what he is like but not as i remember nikolenka him i just shut my eyes and remember but boris no she shut her nothing at all 
 oh natasha said sonya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was out of the question i am in love with your brother once for all and whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as long as i live 
 natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said nothing she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of but natasha had not yet felt anything like it she believed it could be but did not understand it 
 shall you write to him she asked 
 sonya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself 
 i know i think if he writes i will write too she said blushing 
 and you feel ashamed to write to him 
 sonya smiled 
 no 
 and i should be ashamed to write to boris not going to 
 why should you be ashamed 
 well i know awkward and would make me ashamed 
 and i know why be ashamed said petya offended by previous remark because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles that was how petya described his namesake the new count bezukhov and now in love with that singer he meant italian singing master why ashamed 
 petya a stupid said natasha 
 not more stupid than you madam said the petya with the air of an old brigadier 
 the countess had been prepared by anna hints at dinner on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter came on tiptoe to the countess door and paused 
 come in she said to the old count who was following her come later and she went in closing the door behind her 
 the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened 
 at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps anna mikhaylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill 
 it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips 
 when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away the bald head vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the room and the reading of the letter began after a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his promotion nicholas said that he kissed his and hands asking for their blessing and that he kissed vera natasha and petya besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schoss and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear sonya whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was crying 
 why are you crying mamma asked vera from all he says one should be glad and not cry 
 this was quite true but the count the countess and natasha looked at her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought the countess 
 nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she did not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses and dmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of virtues how strange how extraordinary how joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had first learned to say pear and then granny that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warrior doing some kind of work of his own without help or guidance the universal experience of ages showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the countess her growth toward manhood at each of its stages had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty years before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this letter he now was 
 what a style how charmingly he describes said she reading the descriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word about himself not a word about some denisov or other though he himself i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about his sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has remembered everybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only so high i always said 
 for more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikhaylovna practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostovs supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards there was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regiment which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the grand courier to boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the letters were from the old count the countess petya vera natasha and sonya and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the garden of paradise 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a son who had a larger and more beautiful 
 collection of books than any one else in the world and full of 
 splendid engravings he could read and obtain information respecting every people of every land but not a word could he find to explain the situation of the garden of paradise and this was just what he most wished to know his grandmother had told him when he was quite a little boy just old enough to go to school that each flower in the garden of paradise was a sweet cake that the pistils were full of rich wine that on one flower history was written on another geography or tables so those who wished to learn their 
 lessons had only to eat some of the cakes and the more they ate 
 the more history geography or tables they knew he believed it all 
 then but as he grew older and learnt more and more he became wise 
 enough to understand that the splendor of the garden of paradise 
 must be very different to all this oh why did eve pluck the fruit 
 from the tree of knowledge why did adam eat the forbidden fruit 
 thought the son if i had been there it would never have 
 happened and there would have been no sin in the world the garden of paradise occupied all his thoughts till he reached his 
 seventeenth year one day he was walking alone in the wood which was his greatest pleasure when evening came on the clouds gathered and the rain poured down as if the sky had been a waterspout and it was as dark as the bottom of a well at midnight sometimes he slipped over the smooth grass or fell over stones that projected out of the rocky ground 
 
 every thing was dripping with moisture and the poor prince had not 
 a dry thread about him he was obliged at last to climb over great 
 blocks of stone with water spurting from the thick moss he began 
 to feel quite faint when he heard a most singular rushing noise 
 and saw before him a large cave from which came a blaze of light 
 in the middle of the cave an immense fire was burning and a noble 
 stag with its branching horns was placed on a spit between the 
 trunks of two it was turning slowly before the fire and 
 an elderly woman as large and strong as if she had been a man in 
 disguise sat by throwing one piece of wood after another into the 
 flames 
 
 come in she said to the prince sit down by the fire and dry 
 yourself 
 
 there is a great draught here said the prince as he seated 
 himself on the ground 
 
 it will be worse when my sons come home replied the woman 
 you are now in the cavern of the winds and my sons are the four winds of heaven can you understand that 
 
 where are your sons asked the prince 
 
 it is difficult to answer stupid questions said the woman 
 
 my sons have plenty of business on hand they are playing at 
 shuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the hall and she 
 pointed upwards 
 
 oh indeed said the prince but you speak more roughly and 
 harshly and are not so gentle as the women i am used to 
 
 yes that is because they have nothing else to do but i am 
 obliged to be harsh to keep my boys in order and i can do it 
 although they are so do you see those four sacks 
 hanging on the wall well they are just as much afraid of those 
 sacks as you used to be of the rat behind the i can 
 bend the boys together and put them in the sacks without any 
 resistance on their parts i can tell you there they stay and dare 
 not attempt to come out until i allow them to do so and here comes 
 one of them 
 
 it was the north wind who came in bringing with him a cold 
 piercing blast large hailstones rattled on the floor and 
 snowflakes were scattered around in all directions he wore a bearskin dress and cloak his sealskin cap was drawn over his ears long icicles hung from his beard and one hailstone after another rolled from the collar of his jacket 
 
 go too near the fire said the prince or your hands 
 and face will be 
 
 said the north wind with a loud laugh why frost 
 is my greatest delight what sort of a little snip are you and how 
 did you find your way to the cavern of the winds 
 
 he is my guest said the old woman and if you are not 
 satisfied with that explanation you can go into the sack do you 
 understand me 
 
 that settled the matter so the north wind began to relate his 
 adventures whence he came and where he had been for a whole month 
 
 i come from the polar seas he said i have been on the 
 island with the russian i sat and slept at the helm of 
 their ship as they sailed away from north cape sometimes when i 
 woke the would fly about my legs they are curious birds they give one flap with their wings and then on their outstretched pinions soar far away 
 
 make such a long story of it said the mother of the 
 winds what sort of a place is island 
 
 a very beautiful place with a floor for dancing as smooth and 
 flat as a plate snow partly covered with moss sharp 
 stones and skeletons of walruses and lie all about 
 their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay it would seem as if 
 the sun never shone there i blew gently to clear away the mist 
 and then i saw a little hut which had been built from the wood of a 
 wreck and was covered with the skins of the walrus the fleshy side 
 outwards it looked green and red and on the roof sat a growling 
 bear then i went to the sea shore to look after birds nests and 
 saw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths and screaming for 
 food i blew into the thousand little throats and quickly stopped 
 their screaming farther on were the walruses with heads and 
 teeth a yard long rolling about like great worms 
 
 you relate your adventures very well my son said the mother 
 
 it makes my mouth water to hear you 
 
 after that continued the north wind the hunting commenced 
 
 the harpoon was flung into the breast of the walrus so that a smoking stream of blood spurted forth like a fountain and besprinkled the ice then i thought of my own game i began to blow and set my own ships the great icebergs sailing so that they might crush the boats 
 
 oh how the sailors howled and cried out but i howled louder than 
 they they were obliged to unload their cargo and throw their 
 chests and the dead walruses on the ice then i sprinkled snow over 
 them and left them in their crushed boats to drift southward and 
 to taste salt water they will never return to island 
 
 so you have done mischief said the mother of the winds 
 
 i shall leave others to tell the good i have done he replied 
 
 but here comes my brother from the west i like him best of all 
 for he has the smell of the sea about him and brings in a cold fresh 
 air as he enters 
 
 is that the little zephyr asked the prince 
 
 yes it is the little zephyr said the old woman but he is not 
 little now in years gone by he was a beautiful boy now that is all 
 past 
 
 he came in looking like a wild man and he wore a slouched hat to 
 protect his head from injury in his hand he carried a club cut 
 from a mahogany tree in the american forests not a trifle to carry 
 
 whence do you come asked the mother 
 
 i come from the wilds of the forests where the thorny brambles 
 form thick hedges between the trees where the lies in the 
 wet grass and mankind seem to be unknown 
 
 what were you doing there 
 
 i looked into the deep river and saw it rushing down from the 
 rocks the water drops mounted to the clouds and glittered in the 
 rainbow i saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river but the 
 strong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks which 
 flew into the air as the waters dashed onwards leaving the buffalo to 
 be hurled over the waterfall this pleased me so i raised a storm 
 which rooted up old trees and sent them floating down the river 
 and what else have you done asked the old woman 
 
 i have rushed wildly across the savannahs i have stroked the 
 wild horses and shaken the from the trees yes i have 
 many stories to relate but i need not tell everything i know you 
 know it all very well you old lady and he kissed his 
 mother so roughly that she nearly fell backwards oh he was indeed a wild fellow 
 
 now in came the south wind with a turban and a flowing bedouin 
 cloak 
 
 how cold it is here said he throwing more wood on the fire 
 
 it is easy to feel that the north wind has arrived here before me 
 
 why it is hot enough here to roast a bear said the north wind 
 
 you are a bear yourself said the other 
 
 do you want to be put in the sack both of you said the old 
 woman sit down now on that stone yonder and tell me where you have been 
 
 in africa mother i went out with the hottentots who were 
 in the kaffir land where the plains are covered with 
 grass the color of a green olive and here i ran races with the 
 ostrich but i soon outstripped him in swiftness at last i came to 
 the desert in which lie the golden sands looking like the bottom 
 of the sea here i met a caravan and the travellers had just killed 
 their last camel to obtain water there was very little for them and 
 they continued their painful journey beneath the burning sun and over 
 the hot sands which stretched before them a vast boundless desert 
 then i rolled myself in the loose sand and whirled it in burning 
 columns over their heads the dromedarys stood still in terror 
 while the merchants drew their caftans over their heads and threw 
 themselves on the ground before me as they do before allah their 
 god then i buried them beneath a pyramid of sand which covers them all when i blow that away on my next visit the sun will bleach their bones and travellers will see that others have been there before 
 them otherwise in such a wild desert they might not believe it 
 possible 
 
 so you have done nothing but evil said the mother into the 
 sack with you and before he was aware she had seized the south 
 wind round the body and popped him into the bag he rolled about on the floor till she sat herself upon him to keep him still 
 
 these boys of yours are very lively said the prince 
 
 yes she replied but i know how to correct them when 
 necessary and here comes the fourth in came the east wind 
 dressed like a chinese 
 
 oh you come from that quarter do you said she i thought you 
 had been to the garden of paradise 
 
 i am going there he replied i have not been there 
 for a hundred years i have just come from china where i danced round the porcelain tower till all the bells jingled again in the streets 
 an official flogging was taking place and bamboo canes were being 
 broken on the shoulders of men of every high position from the 
 first to the ninth grade they cried many thanks my fatherly 
 benefactor but i am sure the words did not come from their hearts 
 so i rang the bells till they sounded ding 
 
 you are a wild boy said the old woman it is well for you that 
 you are going to the garden of paradise you always get 
 improved in your education there drink deeply from the fountain of 
 wisdom while you are there and bring home a bottleful for me 
 
 that i will said the east wind but why have you put my 
 brother south in a bag let him out for i want him to tell me about 
 the the princess always wants to hear of this bird 
 when i pay her my visit every hundred years if you will open the 
 sack sweetest mother i will give you two pocketfuls of tea green 
 and fresh as when i gathered it from the spot where it grew 
 
 well for the sake of the tea and because you are my own boy 
 i will open the bag 
 
 she did so and the south wind crept out looking quite cast down 
 because the prince had seen his disgrace 
 
 there is a for the princess he said the old 
 phoenix the only one in the world gave it to me himself he has 
 scratched on it with his beak the whole of his history during the 
 hundred years he has lived she can there read how the old phoenix set fire to his own nest and sat upon it while it was burning like a 
 hindoo widow the dry twigs around the nest crackled and smoked till the flames burst forth and consumed the phoenix to ashes amidst the fire lay an egg red hot which presently burst with a loud report 
 and out flew a young bird he is the only phoenix in the world and 
 the king over all the other birds he has bitten a hole in the leaf 
 which i give you and that is his greeting to the princess 
 
 now let us have something to eat said the mother of the 
 winds so they all sat down to feast on the roasted stag and as the 
 prince sat by the side of the east wind they soon became good 
 friends 
 
 pray tell me said the prince who is that princess of whom you 
 have been talking and where lies the garden of paradise 
 
 ho ho said the east wind would you like to go there well 
 you can fly off with me but i must tell you one thing no 
 human being has been there since the time of adam and eve i suppose you have read of them in your bible 
 
 of course i have said the prince 
 
 well continued the east wind when they were driven out of the 
 garden of paradise it sunk into the earth but it retained its warm 
 sunshine its balmy air and all its splendor the fairy queen lives 
 there in the island of happiness where death never comes and all is 
 beautiful i can manage to take you there if you will sit 
 on my back but now talk any more for i want to go to sleep 
 and then they all slept 
 
 when the prince awoke in the early morning he was not a little 
 surprised at finding himself high up above the clouds he was seated 
 on the back of the east wind who held him faithfully and they were 
 so high in the air that woods and fields rivers and lakes as they 
 lay beneath them looked like a painted map 
 
 good morning said the east wind you might have slept on a 
 while for there is very little to see in the flat country over 
 
 which we are passing unless you like to count the churches they 
 look like spots of chalk on a green board the green board was the 
 name he gave to the green fields and meadows 
 
 it was very rude of me not to say to your mother and 
 your brothers said the prince 
 
 they will excuse you as you were asleep said the east wind 
 and then they flew on faster than ever 
 
 the leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they passed 
 when they flew over seas and lakes the waves rose higher and the 
 large ships dipped into the water like diving swans as darkness 
 came on towards evening the great towns looked charming lights were sparkling now seen now hidden just as the sparks go out one after another on a piece of burnt paper the prince clapped his hands with pleasure but the east wind advised him not to express his 
 admiration in that manner or he might fall down and find himself 
 hanging on a church steeple the eagle in the dark forests flies 
 swiftly but faster than he flew the east wind the cossack on his 
 small horse rides lightly the plains but lighter still passed 
 the prince on the winds of the wind 
 
 there are the himalayas the highest mountains in asia said the 
 east wind we shall soon reach the garden of paradise now 
 then they turned southward and the air became fragrant with 
 the perfume of spices and flowers here figs and pomegranates grew 
 wild and the vines were covered with clusters of blue and purple 
 grapes here they both descended to the earth and stretched 
 themselves on the soft grass while the flowers bowed to the breath of 
 the wind as if to welcome it are we now in the garden of 
 paradise asked the prince 
 
 no indeed replied the east wind but we shall be there very 
 soon do you see that wall of rocks and the cavern beneath it over 
 which the grape vines hang like a green curtain through that cavern 
 we must pass wrap your cloak round you for while the sun scorches you here a few steps farther it will be icy cold the bird flying past the entrance to the cavern feels as if one wing were in the 
 region of summer and the other in the depths of winter 
 
 so this then is the way to the garden of paradise asked the 
 prince as they entered the cavern it was indeed cold but the cold 
 soon passed for the east wind spread his wings and they gleamed like the brightest fire as they passed on through this wonderful cave the prince could see great blocks of stone from which water trickled 
 hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes sometimes it was so 
 narrow that they had to creep on their hands and knees while at other 
 times it was lofty and wide like the free air it had the 
 appearance of a chapel for the dead with petrified organs and 
 silent pipes we seem to be passing through the valley of death to 
 the garden of paradise said the prince 
 
 but the east wind answered not a word only pointed forwards to 
 a lovely blue light which gleamed in the distance the blocks of stone 
 assumed a misty appearance till at last they looked like white clouds 
 in moonlight the air was fresh and balmy like a breeze from the 
 mountains perfumed with flowers from a valley of roses a river clear as the air itself sparkled at their feet while in its clear depths 
 could be seen gold and silver fish sporting in the bright water and 
 purple eels emitting sparks of fire at every moment while the broad 
 leaves of the that floated on its surface flickered 
 with all the colors of the rainbow the flower in its color of flame 
 seemed to receive its nourishment from the water as a lamp is 
 sustained by oil a marble bridge of such exquisite workmanship 
 that it appeared as if formed of lace and pearls led to the island of 
 happiness in which bloomed the garden of paradise the east wind took the prince in his arms and carried him over while the flowers and the leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in tones so full 
 and soft that no human voice could venture to imitate within the 
 garden grew large trees full of sap but whether they were 
 or gigantic the prince knew not the climbing plants 
 hung in garlands of green and gold like the illuminations on the 
 margins of old missals or twined among the initial letters birds 
 flowers and festoons appeared intermingled in seeming confusion 
 close by on the grass stood a group of peacocks with radiant 
 tails outspread to the sun the prince touched them and found to his 
 surprise that they were not really birds but the leaves of the 
 burdock tree which shone with the colors of a tail the 
 lion and the tiger gentle and tame were springing about like playful 
 cats among the green bushes whose perfume was like the fragrant 
 blossom of the olive the plumage of the glistened like 
 pearls as it struck the mane with its wings while the 
 antelope usually so shy stood near nodding its head as if it wished 
 to join in the frolic the fairy of paradise next made her appearance 
 her raiment shone like the sun and her serene countenance beamed with happiness like that of a mother rejoicing over her child she was 
 young and beautiful and a train of lovely maidens followed her 
 each wearing a bright star in her hair the east wind gave her the 
 on which was written the history of the phoenix and her 
 eyes sparkled with joy she then took the prince by the hand and 
 led him into her palace the walls of which were richly colored 
 like a when it is turned to the sun the roof had the 
 appearance of an inverted flower and the colors grew deeper and 
 brighter to the gazer the prince walked to a window and saw what 
 appeared to be the tree of knowledge of good and evil with adam and eve standing by and the serpent near them i thought they were 
 banished from paradise he said 
 
 the princess smiled and told him that time had engraved each 
 event on a in the form of a picture but unlike other 
 pictures all that it represented lived and moved the leaves 
 rustled and the persons went and came as in a he 
 looked through another pane and saw the ladder in dream on which the angels were ascending and descending with outspread wings 
 
 all that had ever happened in the world here lived and moved on the 
 panes of glass in pictures such as time alone could produce the 
 fairy now led the prince into a large lofty room with transparent 
 walls through which the light shone here were portraits each one 
 appearing more beautiful than the other millions of happy beings 
 whose laughter and song mingled in one sweet melody some of these 
 were in such an elevated position that they appeared smaller than 
 the smallest rosebud or like pencil dots on paper in the centre of 
 the hall stood a tree with drooping branches from which hung 
 golden apples both great and small looking like oranges amid the 
 green leaves it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil from 
 which adam and eve had plucked and eaten the forbidden fruit and from each leaf trickled a bright red dewdrop as if the tree were weeping tears of blood for their sin let us now take the boat said the fairy a sail on the cool waters will refresh us but we shall not 
 move from the spot although the boat may rock on the swelling 
 water the countries of the world will glide before us but we shall 
 remain still 
 
 it was indeed wonderful to behold first came the lofty alps 
 and covered with clouds and dark pines the horn resounded and the shepherds sang merrily in the valleys the bent their drooping branches over the boat black swans floated on the water and singular animals and flowers appeared on the distant shore new holland the fifth division of the world now glided by with mountains in the background looking blue in the distance they 
 heard the song of the priests and saw the wild dance of the savage to 
 the sound of the drums and trumpets of bone the pyramids of egypt 
 rising to the clouds columns and sphinxes overthrown and buried in 
 the sand followed in their turn while the northern lights flashed 
 out over the extinguished volcanoes of the north in fireworks none 
 could imitate 
 
 the prince was delighted and yet he saw hundreds of other 
 wonderful things more than can be described can i stay here 
 forever asked he 
 
 that depends upon yourself replied the fairy if you do not 
 like adam long for what is forbidden you can remain here always 
 
 i should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge said 
 the prince there is abundance of fruit equally beautiful 
 
 examine your own heart said the princess and if you do not 
 feel sure of its strength return with the east wind who brought 
 you he is about to fly back and will not return here for a hundred 
 years the time will not seem to you more than a hundred hours yet 
 even that is a long time for temptation and resistance every evening 
 when i leave you i shall be obliged to say come with me and to 
 beckon to you with my hand but you must not listen nor move from 
 your place to follow me for with every step you will find your 
 power to resist weaker if once you attempted to follow me you 
 would soon find yourself in the hall where grows the tree of 
 knowledge for i sleep beneath its perfumed branches if you stooped 
 over me i should be forced to smile if you then kissed my lips 
 the garden of paradise would sink into the earth and to you it 
 would be lost a keen wind from the desert would howl around you cold rain fall on your head and sorrow and woe be your future lot 
 i will remain said the prince 
 
 so the east wind kissed him on the forehead and said be firm 
 then shall we meet again when a hundred years have passed farewell 
 farewell then the east wind spread his broad pinions which shone 
 like the lightning in harvest or as the northern lights in a cold 
 winter 
 
 farewell farewell echoed the trees and the flowers 
 storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands to accompany 
 him to the boundaries of the garden 
 
 now we will commence dancing said the fairy and when it is 
 nearly over at sunset while i am dancing with you i shall make a 
 sign and ask you to follow me but do not obey i shall be obliged to 
 repeat the same thing for a hundred years and each time when the 
 trial is past if you resist you will gain strength till resistance becomes easy and at last the temptation will be quite overcome this evening as it will be the first time i have warned you 
 
 after this the fairy led him into a large hall filled with 
 transparent lilies the yellow stamina of each flower formed a tiny 
 golden harp from which came forth strains of music like the mingled 
 tones of flute and lyre beautiful maidens slender and graceful in 
 form and robed in transparent gauze floated through the dance and 
 sang of the happy life in the garden of paradise where death never 
 entered and where all would bloom forever in immortal youth as the 
 sun went down the whole heavens became crimson and gold and tinted the lilies with the hue of roses then the beautiful maidens offered to the prince sparkling wine and when he had drank he felt happiness greater than he had ever known before presently the background of the hall opened and the tree of knowledge appeared surrounded by a halo of glory that almost blinded him voices soft and lovely as his sounded in his ears as if she were singing to him my child my beloved child then the fairy beckoned to him and said in sweet accents come with me come with me 
 forgetting his promise forgetting it even on the very first evening he rushed towards her while she continued to beckon to him and to smile the fragrance around him overpowered his senses the music from the harps sounded more entrancing while around the tree appeared millions of smiling faces nodding and singing man should know everything man is the lord of the earth the tree of knowledge no longer wept tears of blood for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars 
 
 come come continued that thrilling voice and the prince 
 followed the call at every step his cheeks glowed and the blood 
 rushed wildly through his veins i must follow he cried it is not 
 a sin it cannot be to follow beauty and joy i only want to see 
 her sleep and nothing will happen unless i kiss her and that i 
 will not do for i have strength to resist and a determined will 
 the fairy threw off her dazzling attire bent back the boughs and 
 in another moment was hidden among them 
 
 i have not sinned yet said the prince and i will not and 
 then he pushed aside the boughs to follow the princess she was 
 lying already asleep beautiful as only a fairy in the garden of 
 paradise could be she smiled as he bent over her and he saw tears 
 trembling out of her beautiful eyelashes do you weep for me he 
 whispered oh weep not thou loveliest of women now do i begin to understand the happiness of paradise i feel it to my inmost soul 
 in every thought a new life is born within me one moment of such 
 happiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe he stooped and 
 kissed the tears from her eyes and touched her lips with his 
 a clap of thunder loud and awful resounded through the trembling 
 air all around him fell into ruin the lovely fairy the beautiful 
 garden sunk deeper and deeper the prince saw it sinking down in 
 the dark night till it shone only like a star in the distance beneath him then he felt a coldness like death creeping over him his eyes closed and he became insensible 
 
 when he recovered a chilling rain was beating upon him and a 
 sharp wind blew on his head alas what have i done he sighed i 
 have sinned like adam and the garden of paradise has sunk into the 
 earth he opened his eyes and saw the star in the distance but it 
 was the morning star in heaven which glittered in the darkness 
 
 presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of the 
 forest close to the cavern of the winds and the mother of the 
 winds sat by his side she looked angry and raised her arm in the air 
 as she spoke the very first evening she said well i expected 
 it if you were my son you should go into the sack 
 
 and there he will have to go at last said a strong old man 
 with large black wings and a scythe in his hand whose name was 
 death he shall be laid in his coffin but not yet i will allow 
 him to wander about the world for a while to atone for his sin and 
 to give him time to become better but i shall return when he least 
 expects me i shall lay him in a black coffin place it on my head 
 and fly away with it beyond the stars there also blooms a garden of 
 paradise and if he is good and pious he will be admitted but if 
 his thoughts are bad and his heart is full of sin he will sink 
 with his coffin deeper than the garden of paradise has sunk once in 
 every thousand years i shall go and fetch him when he will either 
 be condemned to sink still deeper or be raised to a happier life in 
 the world beyond the stars

 of judicature 
 judges ought to remember that their office is ius dicere and not ius dare to 
 interpret law and not to make law or give law else will it be like the authority 
 claimed by the church of rome which under pretext of exposition of scripture doth not stick to add and alter and to pronounce that which they do not find and by show of antiquity to introduce novelty judges ought to be more learned than witty more reverent than plausible and more advised than confident above all things integrity is their portion and proper virtue cursed saith the law is he that 
 removeth the landmark 
 the mislayer of a mere stone is to blame but it is the unjust judge that is the capital remover of landmarks when he defineth amiss of lands and property one foul sentence doth more hurt than many foul examples for these do but corrupt the stream the other corrupted the fountain so saith solomon fons twbatus et vena corrupta est iustus cadens in causa sua coram adversario 
 the office of judges may have reference unto the parties that sue unto me advocates that plead unto the clerks and ministers of justice underneath them and to the sovereign or state above them 
 
 first for the causes or parties that sue there be saith the scripture that turn 
 judgement into wormwood and surely there be also that turn it into vinegar for 
 injustice maketh it bitter and delays make it sour the principal duty of a judge 
 is to suppress force and fraud whereof force is the more pernicious when it is open and fraud when it is close and disguised 
 add thereto contentious suits which ought to be spewed out as the surfeit of courts a judge ought to prepare his way to a just sentence as god useth to prepare his way by raising valleys and taking down hills so when there appeared on eidier side an high hand violent prosecution cunning advantages taken 
 combination power great counsel then is the virtue of a judge seen to make 
 inequality equal that he may plant his judgement as upon an even ground qui fortiter emungit elicit sangwiem and where the winepress is hard wrought it yields a harsh wine that tastes of the grapestone judges must beware of hard constructions and strained inferences for there is no worse torture than the torture of laws 
 
 specially in case of laws penal they ought to have care that that which was meant 
 for terror be not turned into rigour and that they bring not upon the people that 
 shower whereof the scripture speaketh plwt supa eos laqueos for penal laws pressed are a shower of snares upon the people 
 therefore let penal laws if they have been sleepers of long or if they be grown unfit for the present time be by wise judges confined in me execution cffidum est ut res ita tempora renon c in causes of life and death judges ought as far as the law permitteth in justice to remember mercy and to cast 
 a severe eye upon the example but a merciful eye upon the person 
 
 secondly for me advocates and counsel that plead patience and gravity of hearing 
 is an essential part of justice and an overspeaking judge is no well tuned cymbal 
 it is no grace to a judge first to find that which he might have heard in due time 
 from the bar or to show quickness of conceit in cutting off evidence or counsel too short or to prevent information by questions though pertinent the parts of a judge in hearing are four to direct the evidence to moderate length repetition or 
 impertinency of speech to recapitulate select and collate the material points of 
 that which ham been said and to give the rule or sentence 
 whatsoever is above these is too much and proceedeth either of glory and willingness to speak or of impatience to hear or of shortness of memory or of want of a staid and equal attention it is a strange thing to see that the boldness of advocates should prevail with judges whereas they should imitate god in whose seat they sit who represseth the presumptuous and giveth grace to the modest but it is more strange that judges should have noted favourites which cannot but cause multiplication of fees and suspicion of byways 
 there is due from the judge to me advocate some commendation and gracing where causes are well handled and fair pleaded especially towards the side which obtainem not for that upholds in the client the reputation of his counsel 
 and beats down in him the conceit of his cause there is likewise due to the public a civil reprehension of advocates where there appeared cunning counsel gross neglect slight information indiscreet pressing or an defence and let not the counsel at the bar chop with the judge nor wind himself into he handling of the cause anew after the judge hath declared his sentence but on the other side let not the judge meet the cause half way nor give occasion to the party to say his counsel or proofs were not heard 
 
 thirdly for that that concerns clerks and ministers the place of justice is an 
 hallowed place and therefore not only the bench but the footpace and precincts 
 and purprise thereof ought to be preserved without scandal and corruption for 
 certainly graves as the scripture sailh will not be gathered of thorns or thistles 
 neither can justice yield her fruit with sweetness amongst the briars and brambles 
 of catching and polling clerks and ministers 
 the attendance of courts is subject to four bad instruments first certain persons that are the sowers of suits which make the court swell and the country pine the second sort is of those that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction and are not truly anidcuriae bvxpcaiasitiaiiiae in puffing a court up beyond her bounds for their own scraps and advantage 
 the third sort is of those that may be accounted the left hands of courts persons that are full of nimble and sinister tricks and shifts whereby they pervert the plain 
 and direct courses of courts and bring justice into oblique lines and labyrinths 
 and the fourth is the poller and exacter of fees which justifies the common 
 resemblance of the courts of justice to the bush whereunto while the sheep flies 
 for defence in weather he is sure to lose part of his fleece on the other side 
 an ancient clerk skilful in precedents wary in proceeding and understanding in 
 the business of the court is an excellent finger of a court and doth many times 
 point the way to the judge himself 
 
 fourthly for that which may concern the sovereign and estate judges ought above 
 all to remember the conclusion of the roman twelve tables sahispcpuli supremo lex and to know that laws except they be in order to that end are but things captious and oracles not well inspired 
 therefore it is an happy thing in a state when kings and states do often consult with judges and again when judges do often consult with the king and state the one when there is matter of law intervenient in business of state the other when there is some consideration of state intervenient in matter of law for many times the things deduced to judgement may be moon and tuum when the reason and consequence thereof may trench to point of estate i call matter of estate not only the parts of sovereignty but whatsoever introduceth any great alteration or dangerous precedent or concemeth manifestly any great portion of people and let no man weakly conceive that just laws and true policy have any antipathy for they are like the spirits and sinews that one moves with the other 
 
 let judges also remember that throne was supported by lions on both sides let them be lions but yet lions under the throne being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty let not judges also be so ignorant of their own right as to think there is not left to them as a principal part of 
 their office a wise use and application of laws for they may remember what the 
 apostle saith of a greater law than theirs nos sdmus qwa lex bona est

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter i 
 
 sister simplice 
 the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at m sur m but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we preserve out of respect for the truth 
 on the afternoon following the visit of javert m madeleine went to see fantine according to his wont 
 before entering room he had sister simplice summoned 
 the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazariste ladies like all sisters of charity bore the names of sister perpetue and sister simplice 
 sister perpetue was an ordinary villager a sister of charity in a coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters any other service 
 she was a nun as other women are cooks this type is not so very rare 
 the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline 
 these rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion 
 the transition from a drover to a carmelite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk 
 a little more amplitude in the smock and it becomes a frock 
 sister perpetue was a robust nun from marines near pontoise who chattered her patois droned grumbled sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was crabbed with the dying almost flung god in their faces stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage was bold honest and ruddy 
 sister simplice was white with a waxen pallor 
 beside sister perpetue she was the taper beside the candle 
 vincent de paul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude 
 they shall have for their convent only the house of the sick for cell only a hired room for chapel only their parish church for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals for enclosure only obedience for gratings only the fear of god for veil only modesty 
 this ideal was realized in the living person of sister simplice 
 she had never been young and it seemed as though she would never grow old no one could have told sister age 
 she was a person we dare not say a was gentle austere cold and who had never lied 
 she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than granite 
 she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine 
 there was so to speak silence in her speech she said just what was necessary and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a this delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of god 
 let us emphasize one detail never to have lied never to have said for any interest whatever even in indifference any single thing which was not the truth the sacred truth was sister distinctive trait it was the accent of her virtue 
 she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity 
 the abbe sicard speaks of sister simplice in a letter to the massieu however pure and sincere we may be we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little innocent lie 
 she did not 
 little lie innocent such a thing exist 
 to lie is the absolute form of evil 
 to lie a little is not possible 
 he who lies lies the whole lie 
 to lie is the very face of the demon 
 satan has two names he is called satan and lying 
 that is what she thought and as she thought so she did 
 the result was the whiteness which we have whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance 
 her smile was white her glance was white there was not a single web not a grain of dust on the glass window of that conscience 
 on entering the order of saint vincent de paul she had taken the name of simplice by special choice simplice of sicily as we know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse a lie which would have saved her 
 this patron saint suited this soul 
 sister simplice on her entrance into the order had had two faults which she had gradually corrected 
 she had a taste for dainties and she liked to receive letters 
 she never read anything but a book of prayers printed in latin in coarse type she did not understand latin but she understood the book 
 this pious woman had conceived an affection for fantine probably feeling a latent virtue there and she had devoted herself almost exclusively to her care 
 m madeleine took sister simplice apart and recommended fantine to her in a singular tone which the sister recalled later on 
 on leaving the sister he approached fantine 
 fantine awaited m appearance every day as one awaits a ray of warmth and joy 
 she said to the sisters i only live when monsieur le maire is here 
 she had a great deal of fever that day 
 as soon as she saw m madeleine she asked him 
 and cosette 
 he replied with a smile 
 soon 
 m madeleine was the same as usual with fantine 
 only he remained an hour instead of half an hour to great delight he urged every one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything 
 it was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre 
 but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground fast 
 then he returned to the and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of france which hung in his study he wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil

 book three 
 chapter vii 
 
 on the twelfth of november active army in camp before olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors the russian and the austrian the guards just arrived from russia spent the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review reaching the field at olmutz by ten 
 that day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris telling him that the ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops after their active service were stationed near olmutz and the camp swarmed with sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of tempting wares the pavlograds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses rostov who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought horse bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and the sutlers on receiving boris letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmutz dined there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the guards camp to find his old playmate rostov had not yet had time to get his uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a cross equally shabby riding breeches lined with worn leather and an saber with a sword knot the don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head as he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress boris and all his comrades of the guards by his appearance that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire 
 the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline they had come by easy stages their knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper posts boris had been quartered and had marched all the way with berg who was already in command of a company berg who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in staff berg and boris having rested after march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess berg held a smoking pipe between his knees boris in the accurate way characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting move and watched his face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on 
 well how are you going to get out of that he remarked 
 try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing his hand 
 at that moment the door opened 
 here he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh you petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian french at which he and boris used to laugh long ago 
 dear me how you have changed 
 boris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace his friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youth that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did but notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times 
 they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young men take their first steps on road each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them 
 oh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if been to a fete not like us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his own breeches the german landlady hearing loud voice popped her head in at the door 
 eh is she pretty he asked with a wink 
 why do you shout so frighten them said boris i did not expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday by bolkonski an adjutant of a friend of mine i did not think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you been under fire already asked boris 
 without answering rostov shook the cross of st george fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm glanced at berg with a smile 
 as you see he said 
 indeed yes yes said boris with a smile and we too have had a splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls i tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers 
 and the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the imperial family 
 oh you guards said rostov i say send for some wine 
 boris made a grimace 
 if you really want it said he 
 he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent for wine 
 yes and i have some money and a letter to give you he added 
 rostov took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines he glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the letter 
 well sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our pay i can tell you for myself 
 i say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with and i happen to be there go at once to be out of your way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance 
 oh mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice 
 go across to our hosts they invited you added boris 
 berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile 
 oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter 
 why 
 oh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them such a fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly well have you sent gabriel for some wine all right have some 
 in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at anna advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it 
 what nonsense much i need it said rostov throwing the letter under the table 
 why have you thrown that away asked boris 
 it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for 
 why what the devil said boris picking it up and reading the address this letter would be of great use to you 
 i want nothing and i be adjutant 
 why not inquired boris 
 a job 
 you are still the same dreamer i see remarked boris shaking his head 
 and still the same diplomatist but not the point come how are you asked rostov 
 well as you see so far all right but i confess i should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front 
 why 
 because when once a man starts on military service he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible 
 oh it said rostov evidently thinking of something else 
 he looked intently and inquiringly into his eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question 
 old gabriel brought in the wine 
 we now send for berg asked boris he would drink with you i 
 well send for him and how do you get on with that german asked rostov with a contemptuous smile 
 he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered boris 
 again rostov looked intently into boris eyes and sighed berg returned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated the guardsmen told rostov of their march and how they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of the grand quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company commander 
 would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and than his did well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the right so i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day what keeping head means the way count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke 
 yes that was fine said rostov smiling 
 but boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about it and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schon grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as it really was rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his hearers who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story they would either not have believed him or still worse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he told them all that 
 in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew whom boris was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent with papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on boris hoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of man he gave boris a pleasant smile frowned as with eyes he looked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere stranger glancing however at boris he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line 
 in spite of prince disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans 
 we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger 
 berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed gaily 
 as to your business prince andrew continued addressing boris we will talk of it later and he looked round at rostov come to me after the review and we will do what is possible 
 and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostov whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were talking of the schon grabern affair were you there 
 i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the 
 bolkonski noticed the state of mind and it amused him with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair 
 yes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown furious now at boris now at bolkonski yes many stories but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the fire our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything 
 of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly amiable smile 
 a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mingled at that moment in soul 
 i am not talking about you he said i know you and frankly i want to i am speaking of the staff in general 
 and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you sufficient but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and besides drubetskoy who says he is an old friend of yours is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the review i shall expect you drubetskoy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out 
 only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the girl who trod on the loaf 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling her 
 shoes and the misfortunes that happened to her in consequence are 
 well known her name was inge she was a poor child but proud and 
 presuming and with a bad and cruel disposition when quite a little 
 child she would delight in catching flies and tearing off their 
 wings so as to make creeping things of them when older she would 
 take cockchafers and beetles and stick pins through them then she 
 pushed a green leaf or a little scrap of paper towards their feet 
 and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it fast and 
 turn over and over in their struggles to get free from the pin she 
 would say the cockchafer is reading see how he turns over the 
 leaf she grew worse instead of better with years and 
 unfortunately she was pretty which caused her to be excused when 
 she should have been sharply reproved 
 
 your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it her mother 
 often said to her as a little child you used to trample on my apron 
 but one day i fear you will trample on my heart and alas this fear 
 was realized 
 
 inge was taken to the house of some rich people who lived at a 
 distance and who treated her as their own child and dressed her so 
 fine that her pride and arrogance increased 
 
 when she had been there about a year her patroness said to her 
 you ought to go for once and see your parents inge 
 
 so inge started to go and visit her parents but she only wanted 
 to show herself in her native place that the people might see how 
 fine she was she reached the entrance of the village and saw the 
 young laboring men and maidens standing together chatting and her own mother amongst them mother was sitting on a stone to rest with a fagot of sticks lying before her which she had picked up in the wood then inge turned back she who was so finely dressed she felt ashamed of her mother a poorly clad woman who picked up wood in the forest she did not turn back out of pity for her 
 poverty but from pride 
 
 another went by and her mistress said you ought to go 
 home again and visit your parents inge and i will give you a 
 large wheaten loaf to take to them they will be glad to see you i am 
 sure 
 
 so inge put on her best clothes and her new shoes drew her dress 
 up around her and set out stepping very carefully that she might be 
 clean and neat about the feet and there was nothing wrong in doing 
 so but when she came to the place where the footpath led across the 
 moor she found small pools of water and a great deal of mud so 
 she threw the loaf into the mud and trod upon it that she might pass 
 without wetting her feet but as she stood with one foot on the loaf 
 and the other lifted up to step forward the loaf began to sink 
 under her lower and lower till she disappeared altogether and 
 only a few bubbles on the surface of the muddy pool remained to show where she had sunk and this is the story 
 
 but where did inge go she sank into the ground and went down 
 to the marsh woman who is always brewing there 
 
 the marsh woman is related to the elf maidens who are 
 for songs are sung and pictures painted about them but of the marsh 
 woman nothing is known excepting that when a mist arises from the 
 meadows in summer time it is because she is brewing beneath them 
 to the marsh brewery inge sunk down to a place which no one can endure for long a heap of mud is a palace compared with the marsh brewery and as inge fell she shuddered in every limb and soon became cold and stiff as marble her foot was still fastened to the loaf which bowed her down as a golden ear of corn bends the stem 
 
 an evil spirit soon took possession of inge and carried her to 
 a still worse place in which she saw crowds of unhappy people 
 waiting in a state of agony for the gates of mercy to be opened to 
 them and in every heart was a miserable and eternal feeling of 
 unrest it would take too much time to describe the various tortures 
 these people suffered but punishment consisted in standing 
 there as a statue with her foot fastened to the loaf she could 
 move her eyes about and see all the misery around her but she 
 could not turn her head and when she saw the people looking at her 
 she thought they were admiring her pretty face and fine clothes for 
 she was still vain and proud but she had forgotten how soiled her 
 clothes had become while in the marsh brewery and that they were covered with mud a snake had also fastened itself in her hair and hung down her back while from each fold in her dress a great toad peeped out and croaked like an asthmatic poodle worse than all was the terrible hunger that tormented her and she could not stoop to break off a piece of the loaf on which she stood no her back was too stiff and her whole body like a pillar of stone and then came creeping over her face and eyes flies without wings she winked and blinked but they could not fly away for their wings had been 
 pulled off this added to the hunger she felt was horrible torture 
 
 if this lasts much longer she said i shall not be able to 
 bear it but it did last and she had to bear it without being 
 able to help herself 
 
 a tear followed by many scalding tears fell upon her head and 
 rolled over her face and neck down to the loaf on which she stood 
 who could be weeping for inge she had a mother in the world still 
 and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her child will always find their way to the heart but they often increase the 
 torment instead of being a relief and inge could hear all that was 
 said about her in the world she had left and every one seemed cruel 
 to her the sin she had committed in treading on the loaf was known on earth for she had been seen by the cowherd from the hill when she was crossing the marsh and had disappeared 
 
 when her mother wept and exclaimed ah inge what grief thou 
 hast caused thy mother she would say oh that i had never been born 
 
 my tears are useless now 
 
 and then the words of the kind people who had adopted her came 
 to her ears when they said inge was a sinful girl who did not 
 value the gifts of god but trampled them under her feet 
 
 ah thought inge they should have punished me and driven 
 all my naughty tempers out of me 
 
 a song was made about the girl who trod on a loaf to keep her 
 shoes from being soiled and this song was sung everywhere the story of her sin was also told to the little children and they called her 
 wicked inge and said she was so naughty that she ought to be 
 punished inge heard all this and her heart became hardened and 
 full of bitterness 
 
 but one day while hunger and grief were gnawing in her hollow 
 frame she heard a little innocent child while listening to the tale 
 of the vain haughty inge burst into tears and exclaim but will she 
 never come up again 
 
 and she heard the reply no she will never come up again 
 
 but if she were to say she was sorry and ask pardon and promise 
 never to do so again asked the little one 
 
 yes then she might come but she will not beg pardon was the 
 answer 
 
 oh i wish she would said the child who was quite unhappy 
 about it i should be so glad i would give up my doll and all my 
 playthings if she could only come here again poor inge it is so 
 dreadful for her 
 
 these pitying words penetrated to inmost heart and 
 seemed to do her good it was the first time any one had said poor 
 inge without saying something about her faults a little innocent 
 child was weeping and praying for mercy for her it made her feel 
 quite strange and she would gladly have wept herself and it added to 
 her torment to find she could not do so and while she thus suffered 
 in a place where nothing changed years passed away on earth and 
 she heard her name less frequently mentioned but one day a sigh 
 reached her ear and the words inge inge what a grief thou hast 
 been to me i said it would be so it was the last sigh of her 
 dying mother 
 
 after this inge heard her kind mistress say ah poor inge 
 shall i ever see thee again perhaps i may for we know not what may 
 happen in the future but inge knew right well that her mistress 
 would never come to that dreadful place 
 
 a long bitter time then inge heard her name 
 pronounced once more and saw what seemed two bright stars shining above her they were two gentle eyes closing on earth many years had passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about poor inge that child was now an old woman whom god was taking to himself in the last hour of existence the events of a whole life often appear before us and this hour the old woman remembered how when a child she had shed tears over the story of inge and she 
 prayed for her now as the eyes of the old woman closed to earth 
 the eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity and 
 then she in whose last thoughts inge had been so vividly present saw 
 how deeply the poor girl had sunk she burst into tears at the 
 sight and in heaven as she had done when a little child on earth 
 she wept and prayed for poor inge her tears and her prayers echoed 
 through the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul 
 and the unexpected mercy was obtained for it through an tears 
 
 as in thought inge seemed to act over again every sin she had 
 committed on earth she trembled and tears she had never yet been 
 able to weep rushed to her eyes it seemed impossible that the gates 
 of mercy could ever be opened to her but while she acknowledged 
 this in deep penitence a beam of radiant light shot suddenly into the 
 depths upon her more powerful than the sunbeam that dissolves the man of snow which the children have raised more quickly than the 
 snowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the warm lips of a 
 child was the stony form of inge changed and as a little bird she 
 soared with the speed of lightning upward to the world of mortals a 
 bird that felt timid and shy to all things around it that seemed to 
 shrink with shame from meeting any living creature and hurriedly 
 sought to conceal itself in a dark corner of an old ruined wall there 
 it sat cowering and unable to utter a sound for it was voiceless yet 
 how quickly the little bird discovered the beauty of everything around 
 it the sweet fresh air the soft radiance of the moon as its 
 light spread over the earth the fragrance which exhaled from bush and tree made it feel happy as it sat there clothed in its fresh 
 bright plumage all creation seemed to speak of beneficence and 
 love the bird wanted to give utterance to thoughts that stirred in 
 his breast as the cuckoo and the nightingale in the spring but it 
 could not yet in heaven can be heard the song of praise even from 
 a worm and the notes trembling in the breast of the bird were as 
 audible to heaven even as the psalms of david before they had 
 fashioned themselves into words and song 
 
 drew near and a peasant who dwelt close by the old 
 wall stuck up a pole with some ears of corn fastened to the top 
 that the birds of heaven might have feast and rejoice in the happy 
 blessed time and on christmas morning the sun arose and shone upon the ears of corn which were quickly surrounded by a number of twittering birds then from a hole in the wall gushed forth in 
 song the swelling thoughts of the bird as he issued from his hiding 
 place to perform his first good deed on earth and in heaven it was 
 well known who that bird was 
 
 the winter was very hard the ponds were covered with ice and 
 there was very little food for either the beasts of the field or the 
 birds of the air our little bird flew away into the public roads and 
 found here and there in the ruts of the sledges a grain of corn and 
 at the halting places some crumbs of these he ate only a few but 
 he called around him the other birds and the hungry sparrows that 
 they too might have food he flew into the towns and looked about 
 and wherever a kind hand had strewed bread on the for 
 the birds he only ate a single crumb himself and gave all the rest 
 to the rest of the other birds in the course of the winter the bird 
 had in this way collected many crumbs and given them to other birds 
 till they equalled the weight of the loaf on which inge had trod to 
 keep her shoes clean and when the last had been found and given the gray wings of the bird became white and spread 
 themselves out for flight 
 
 see yonder is a cried the children when they saw the 
 white bird as it dived into the sea and rose again into the clear 
 sunlight white and glittering but no one could tell whither it 
 went then although some declared it flew straight to the sun

 of anger 
 to seek to extinguish anger utterly is but a bravery of the stoics we have better 
 oracles be angry but sin not let not the sun go down upon your anger anger must be limited and confined both in race and in time we will first speak how the natural inclination and habit to be angry may be attempered and calmed 
 secondly how the particular motions of anger may be repressed or at least refrained from doing mischief 
 thirdly how to raise anger or appease anger in another 
 
 for the first there is no other way but to meditate and ruminate well upon the effects of anger how it troubles life and the best time to do this is to look back upon anger when the fit is thoroughly over seneca saith well that anger is like ruin which forsakes itself upon that it falls the scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in patience whosoever is out of patience is out of possession of his soul men must not turn bees anunasque in vidnereponunt 
 
 anger is certainly a kind of baseness as it appears well in the weakness of those 
 subjects in whom it reigns children women old folks sick folks only men must 
 beware that they cany their anger rather with scorn than with fear so that they 
 may seem rather to be above the injury than below it which is a thing easily done 
 if a man will give law to himself in it 
 
 for the second point the causes and motives of anger are chiefly three first to 
 be too sensible of hurt for no man is angry that feels not himself hurt and therefore tender and delicate persons must needs be oft angry they have so many things to trouble them which more robust natures have little sense of the next is the apprehension and construction of the injury offered to be in the circumstances 
 thereof full of contempt for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon anger as 
 much or more than the hurt itself and therefore when men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of contempt they do kindle their anger much lastly opinion of the touch of a reputation doth multiply and sharpen anger 
 wherein the remedy is that a man should have as consalvo was wont to say tekan bomnscmsaarem but in all refrainings of anger it is the best remedy to win time and to make a self believe that the opportunity of his revenge is not yet come but that he foresees a time for it and so to still himself in the mean time and reserve it to continue anger from mischief though it take hold of a man there be two things whereof you must have special caution the one of extreme bitterness of words especially if they be accurate and proper for communiamalascta are nothing so much and again that in anger a man reveal no secrets for that makes him not fit for society 
 the other that you do not peremptorily break off in any business in a 
 fit of anger but howsoever you show bitterness do not act anything that is not 
 revocable 
 
 for raising and appeasing anger in another it is done chiefly by choosing of times 
 when men are frowardest and worst disposed to incense them again by gathering as was touched before all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt and the two remedies are by the contraries the former to take good times when first to relate to a man an angry business for the first impression is much and the other is to sever as much as may be me construction of the injury from the point of contempt imputing it to misunderstanding fear passion or what you will

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter ii 
 
 the perspicacity of master scaufflaire 
 from the he betook himself to the extremity of the town to a fleming named master scaufflaer french scaufflaire who let out horses and cabriolets as desired 
 in order to reach this scaufflaire the shortest way was to take the street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which m madeleine resided 
 the cure was it was said a worthy respectable and sensible man 
 at the moment when m madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one in the street and this person noticed this 
 after the mayor had passed the house he halted stood motionless then turned about and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage which had an iron knocker 
 he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly he placed it gently and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously 
 m madeleine found master scaufflaire at home engaged in stitching a harness over 
 master scaufflaire he inquired have you a good horse 
 mr mayor said the fleming all my horses are good 
 what do you mean by a good horse 
 i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day 
 the deuce said the fleming 
 twenty leagues 
 yes 
 hitched to a cabriolet 
 yes 
 and how long can he rest at the end of his journey 
 he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary 
 to traverse the same road 
 yes 
 the deuce the deuce 
 and it is twenty leagues 
 m madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures 
 he showed it to the fleming 
 the figures were 
 you see he said total nineteen and a half as well say twenty leagues 
 mr mayor returned the fleming i have just what you want my little white may have seen him pass occasionally he is a small beast from lower boulonnais 
 he is full of fire they wanted to make a of him at first 
 bah 
 he reared he kicked he laid everybody flat on the ground 
 he was thought to be vicious and no one knew what to do with him 
 i bought him i harnessed him to a carriage 
 that is what he wanted sir he is as gentle as a girl he goes like the wind 
 ah indeed he must not be mounted 
 it does not suit his ideas to be a every one has his ambition 
 draw yes 
 carry 
 no we must suppose that is what he said to himself 
 and he will accomplish the trip 
 your twenty leagues all at a full trot and in less than eight hours but here are the conditions 
 state them 
 in the first place 
 you will give him half an breathing spell midway of the road he will eat and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats for i have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses 
 some one will be by 
 in the second the cabriolet for monsieur le maire 
 yes 
 does monsieur le maire know how to drive 
 yes 
 well monsieur le maire will travel alone and without baggage in order not to overload the horse 
 agreed 
 but as monsieur le maire will have no one with him he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen 
 that is understood 
 i am to have thirty francs a day 
 the days of rest to be paid for a farthing less and the food to be at monsieur le expense 
 m madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table 
 here is the pay for two days in advance 
 fourthly for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy and would fatigue the horse 
 monsieur le maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own 
 i consent to that 
 it is light but it has no cover 
 that makes no difference to me 
 has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter 
 m madeleine did not reply 
 the fleming resumed 
 that it is very cold 
 m madeleine preserved silence 
 master scaufflaire continued 
 that it may rain 
 m madeleine raised his head and said 
 the tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door morning at four 
 of course monsieur le maire replied scaufflaire then scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his he resumed with that careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness 
 but this is what i am thinking of now 
 monsieur le maire has not told me where he is going 
 where is monsieur le maire going 
 he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question 
 are your forelegs good said m madeleine 
 yes monsieur le maire 
 you must hold him in a little when going down hill 
 are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going 
 do not forget to be at my door at precisely four morning replied m madeleine and he took his departure 
 the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said some time afterwards 
 the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more 
 he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air 
 monsieur scaufflaire said he at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me the one bearing the other 
 the one dragging the other monsieur le maire said the fleming with a broad smile 
 so be it 
 well 
 does monsieur le maire wish to purchase them or me 
 no but i wish to guarantee you in any case 
 you shall give me back the sum at my return 
 at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet 
 five hundred francs monsieur le maire 
 here it is 
 m madeleine laid a on the table then left the room and this time he did not return 
 master scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs 
 besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns 
 the fleming called his wife and related the affair to her where the devil could monsieur le maire be going 
 they held counsel together 
 he is going to paris said the wife 
 i believe it said the husband 
 m madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay on the the fleming picked it up and studied it five six eight and a half 
 that must designate the posting relays he turned to his wife 
 i have found out 
 what 
 it is five leagues from here to hesdin six from hesdin to eight and a half from to arras 
 he is going to arras 
 meanwhile m madeleine had returned home 
 he had taken the longest way to return from master as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him and he had wished to avoid it 
 he ascended to his room and there he shut himself up which was a very simple act since he liked to go to bed early 
 nevertheless the portress of the factory who was at the same time m only servant noticed that the light was extinguished at eight and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home adding 
 is monsieur le maire ill 
 i thought he had a rather singular air 
 this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m chamber 
 he paid no heed to the words but went to bed and to sleep 
 towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head 
 he listened it was a footstep pacing back and forth as though some one were walking in the room above him 
 he listened more attentively and recognized m step 
 this struck him as strange usually there was no noise in m chamber until he rose in the morning 
 a moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and then shut again then a piece of furniture was disarranged then a pause ensued then the step began again 
 the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now and staring and through his he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the rays it could only come from the window of m chamber 
 the reflection wavered as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle the shadow of the was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open 
 the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising 
 the cashier fell asleep again an hour or two later he waked again 
 the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead 
 the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle the window was still open 
 this is what had taken place in m room

 book three 
 chapter viii 
 
 the day after rostov had been to see boris a review was held of the austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and those who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors the russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the archduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men 
 from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up on the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth felt that no small matter was happening but an important and solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole 
 from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten all had been brought into due order the ranks were drown up on the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry 
 a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished fighting army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front those recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the line and the austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines under one command and in a like order 
 like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper coming coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops 
 from the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seen approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting eyes front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent 
 in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this was the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst into music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the first regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted 
 rostov standing in the front lines of army which the tsar approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army a feeling of a proud consciousness of might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph 
 he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word 
 hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then hurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar 
 till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two men the emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated 
 the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted attention 
 rostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had recognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twenty paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every movement of the seemed to him enchanting 
 stopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in french to the austrian emperor and smiled 
 seeing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him 
 oh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought rostov i should die of happiness 
 the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen i thank you with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like a voice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar 
 you have earned the st standards and will be worthy of them 
 oh to die to die for him thought rostov 
 the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the soldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrah 
 rostov too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all his might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if only to express his rapture fully 
 the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided 
 how can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything else the tsar did 
 that hesitation lasted only an instant the foot in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at last only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the emperors 
 among the gentlemen of the suite rostov noticed bolkonski sitting his horse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge bolkonski of course not he now thought is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such love such rapture and such what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now 
 when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a ceremonial march past him and rostov on bedouin recently purchased from denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadron that is alone and in full view of the emperor 
 before he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman spurred bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the eye upon him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful action as if flying through the air without touching the ground 
 rostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but blissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed it 
 fine fellows the pavlograds remarked the emperor 
 my god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant thought rostov 
 when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the essen corps arrived and prussia took our side 
 but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his every word and movement was described with ecstasy 
 they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the command commanded by the emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought rostov and most of the officers after the review 
 all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the goblin and the huckster 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a regular student who lived in a garret and had 
 no possessions and there was also a regular huckster to whom the 
 house belonged and who occupied the ground floor a goblin lived with the huckster because at christmas he always had a large dish full 
 of jam with a great piece of butter in the middle the huckster could 
 afford this and therefore the goblin remained with the huckster 
 which was very cunning of him 
 
 one evening the student came into the shop through the back door 
 to buy candles and cheese for himself he had no one to send and 
 therefore he came himself he obtained what he wished and then the 
 huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him and she was a 
 woman who could do more than merely nod for she had usually plenty to say for herself the student nodded in return as he turned to leave then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped it was a leaf torn out of an old book a book that ought not to have been torn up for it was full of poetry 
 
 yonder lies some more of the same sort said the huckster i 
 gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it you shall have the rest 
 for sixpence if you will 
 
 indeed i will said the student give me the book instead of 
 the cheese i can eat my bread and butter without cheese it would 
 be a sin to tear up a book like this you are a clever man and a 
 practical man but you understand no more about poetry than that 
 cask yonder 
 
 this was a very rude speech especially against the cask but 
 the huckster and the student both laughed for it was only said in 
 fun but the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say 
 such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best 
 butter as soon as it was night and the shop closed and every one in 
 bed except the student the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom 
 where the wife slept and took away her tongue which of 
 course she did not then want whatever object in the room he placed 
 his tongue upon immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do it could only be used by one object at a time which was a good thing as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion 
 
 the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask in which lay a quantity of 
 old newspapers 
 
 is it really true he asked that you do not know what poetry 
 is 
 
 of course i know replied the cask poetry is something that 
 always stand in the corner of a newspaper and is sometimes cut out 
 and i may venture to affirm that i have more of it in me than the 
 student has and i am only a poor tub of the 
 
 then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill and how it 
 did go to be sure then he put it on the butter tub and the cash 
 box and they all expressed the same opinion as the tub 
 and a majority must always be respected 
 
 now i shall go and tell the student said the goblin and with 
 these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where the 
 student lived he had a candle burning still and the goblin peeped 
 through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book 
 which he had brought out of the shop but how light the room was from the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full like the stem of a tree from which bright rays spread upward and over the head each leaf was fresh and each flower was like a beautiful female head some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear the fruit gleamed like stars and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music the little goblin had never imagined much less seen or heard of any sight so glorious as this he stood still on tiptoe peeping in 
 till the light went out in the garret the student no doubt had 
 blown out his candle and gone to bed but the little goblin remained 
 standing there nevertheless and listening to the music which still 
 sounded on soft and beautiful a sweet for the student 
 who had lain down to rest 
 
 this is a wonderful place said the goblin i never expected 
 such a thing i should like to stay here with the student and the 
 little man thought it over for he was a sensible little spirit at 
 last he sighed but the student has no jam so he went down stairs 
 again into the shop and it was a good thing he got back 
 when he did for the cask had almost worn out the tongue he 
 had given a description of all that he contained on one side and 
 was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what 
 was there when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the 
 lady but from that time forward the whole shop from the cash box 
 down to the pinewood logs formed their opinions from that of the 
 cask and they all had such confidence in him and treated him with so 
 much respect that when the huckster read the criticisms on 
 theatricals and art of an evening they fancied it must all come 
 from the cask 
 
 but after what he had seen the goblin could no longer sit and 
 listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs so as 
 soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret he took courage 
 for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables 
 drawing him up and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole and while there a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the sea when the storm breaks forth and it brought tears into his eyes he did not himself know why he wept yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears how 
 wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under such 
 a tree but that was out of the question he must be content to 
 look through the keyhole and be thankful for even that 
 
 there he stood on the old landing with the autumn wind blowing 
 down upon him through the it was very cold but the 
 little creature did not really feel it till the light in the garret 
 went out and the tones of music died away then how he shivered 
 and crept down stairs again to his warm corner where it felt 
 and comfortable and when christmas came again and 
 brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter he liked the 
 huckster best of all 
 
 soon after in the middle of the night the goblin was awoke by 
 a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and the 
 house doors and by the sound of the horn for a great fire had broken out and the whole street appeared full of flames was it in their house or a no one could tell for terror had 
 seized upon all the wife was so bewildered that she took 
 her gold out of her ears and put them in her pocket that 
 she might save something at least the huckster ran to get his 
 business papers and the servant resolved to save her blue silk 
 mantle which she had managed to buy each wished to keep the best 
 things they had the goblin had the same wish for with one spring 
 he was up stairs and in the room whom he found standing 
 by the open window and looking quite calmly at the fire which was 
 raging at the house of a neighbor opposite the goblin caught up the 
 wonderful book which lay on the table and popped it into his red cap which he held tightly with both hands the greatest treasure in the house was saved and he ran away with it to the roof and seated 
 himself on the chimney the flames of the burning house opposite 
 illuminated him as he sat both hands pressed tightly over his cap in 
 which the treasure lay and then he found out what feelings really 
 reigned in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended and yet when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect he hesitated and said at last i must divide myself between the two i cannot quite give up the huckster because of the jam 
 
 and this is a representation of human nature we are like the 
 goblin we all go to visit the huckster because of the jam

 of vicissitude of things 
 solomon saith there is no new thing upon the earth so that as plato had an imagination that all knowledge was but remembrance so solomon giveth his sentence that all novelty is but oblivion 
 whereby you may see that the river of lethe runneth as well above ground as below there is an abstruse astrologer that saith if it were not for two things that are constant the one is that he fixed stars ever stand at like distance one from another and never come nearer together nor go further asunder the other that the diurnal motion perpetually keepeth time no individual would last one moment 
 certain it is that the matter is in a perpetual flux and never at a stay the great that bury all things in oblivion are two deluges and earthquakes as for conflagrations and great droughts they do not merely dispeople and destroy car went but a day and the three years drought in the time of elias was but particular and left people alive 
 as for the great burnings by lightnings which are often in the west indies they are but narrow 
 
 but in the other two destructions by deluge and earthquake it is further to be 
 noted that the remnant of people which hap to be preserved are commonly ignorant and mountainous people that can give no account of the time past so that the oblivion is all one as if none had been left if you consider well of the people of the west indies it is very probable that they are newer or a younger people than the people of the old world and it is much more likely that the destruction that hath heretofore been there was not by earthquakes as the egyptian priest told solon concerning the island of auantis that it was swallowed by an earthquake but rather that it was desolated by a particular deluge for earthquakes are seldom in those parts but on the other side they have such pouring rivers as the rivers of asia and africa and europe are but brooks to them their andes likewise or mountains arc far higher than those with us 
 
 whereby it seems that the remnants of generation of men were in such a particular 
 deluge saved as for the observation that macbeth hath that the jealousies of sects doth much extinguish the memory of things traducing gregory the great that he did what in him lay to extinguish all heathen antiquities i do not find that those zeals do any great effects nor last long as it appeared in the succession of sabinian who did revive the former antiquities 
 
 the vicissitudes or mutations in the superior globe are no fit matter for this present 
 argument it may be great year if the world should last so long would have some effect not in renewing the state of like individuals for that is the fume of those that conceive the celestial bodies have more accurate influences upon these things below than indeed they have but in gross comets out of question have likewise power and effect over the gross and mass things but they are rather gazed upon and waited upon in their journey than wisely observed in their effects 
 specially in their respective effects that is what kind of comet for magnitude colour version of the beams placing in the region of heaven or lasting produceth what kind of effects 
 there is a toy which i have heard and i would not have it given over but waited 
 upon a little they say it is observed in the low countries i know not in what part that every five and thirty years the same kind and suit of years and weathers comes about again as great frosts great wet great droughts warm winters summers with little heat and the like and they call it the prime it is a thing i do the rather mention because computing backwards i have found some concurrence 
 
 but to leave these points of nature and to come to men the greatest vicissitude 
 of things amongst men is the vicissitude of sects and religions for those orbs rule 
 in minds most the true religion is built upon the rock the rest are tossed 
 upon the waves of time to speak therefore of the causes of new sects and to give some counsel concerning them as far as the weakness of human judgement can give stay to so great revolutions 
 
 when the religion formerly received is rent by discords and when the holiness of 
 the professors of religion is decayed and full of scandal and withal the times be stupid ignorant and barbarous you may doubt the springing up of a new sect if then also there should arise any extravagant and strange spirit to make himself author thereof all which points held when mohammed published his 
 law if a new sect have not two properties fear it not for it will not spread the 
 one is the supplanting or the opposing of authority established for nothing is 
 more popular than that the other is the giving licence to pleasures and a voluptuous life for as for speculative heresies such as were in ancient times the arians and now the armenians though they work mightily upon wits yet they do not produce any great alterations in states except it be by the help of civil occasions 
 there be three manner of plantations of new sects by the power of signs and miracles by the eloquence and wisdom of speech and persuasion and by the sword for martyrdoms i reckon them amongst miracles because they seem to exceed the strength of human nature and i may do the like of superlative and admirable holiness of life 
 surely there is no better way to stop the rising of new sects and schisms than to reform abuses to compound the smaller differences to proceed mildly and not with sanguinary prosecutions and rather to take off the principal authors by winning and advancing them than to enrage them by violence and bitterness 
 
 the changes and vicissitude in wars are many but chiefly in three things in the 
 seats or stages of the war in the weapons and in the manner of the conduct wars 
 in ancient time seemed more to move from east to west for the persians assyrians arabians tartars which were the invaders were all eastern people it is true the gauls were western but we read but of two incursions of theirs the one to the other to rome but east and west have no certain points of heaven and no more have the wars either from the east or west any certainty of observation 
 
 but north and south are fixed and it hath seldom or never been seen that the far 
 southern people have invaded the northern but contrariwise whereby it is manifest mat the northern tract of the world is in nature the more martial region 
 be it in respect of the stars of that hemisphere or of the great continents that 
 are upon the north whereas the south part for ought that is known is almost all 
 sea or which is most apparent of the cold of the northern parts which is that 
 which without aid of discipline doth make the bodies hardest and me courages warmest 
 
 upon the breaking and shivering of a great state and empire you may be sure to have wars for great empires while they stand do enervate and destroy the forces of the natives which they have subdued resting upon their own protecting forces and then when they fail also all goes to ruin and they become a prey so was it in the decay of the roman empire and likewise in the empire of almaigne after charles the great every bird taking a feather and were not unlike to befall to spain if it should break the great accessions and unions of kingdoms do likewise stir up quarrel 
 for when a state grows to an it is like a great flood that will be sure to 
 overflow as it hath been seen in the states of rome turkey spain and others 
 look when the world hath fewest barbarous peoples but such as commonly will not many or generate except they know means to live as it is almost everywhere at this day except tartary there is no danger of inundations of people but when there be great shoals of people which go on to populate without foreseeing means of life and sustentation it is of necessity that once in an age or two they discharge a portion of their people upon other nations which the ancient northern people were wont to do by lot casting lots what part should stay at home and what should seek their fortunes when a warlike state grows soft and effeminate they may be sure of a war 
 
 for commonly such states are grown rich in the time of their degenerating and so 
 the prey inviteth and their decay in valour encourageth a war 
 
 as for the weapons it hardly falleth under rule and observation yet we see even 
 they have returns and vicissitudes for certain it is that ordnance was known in 
 the city of the oxidrakes in india and was that which the macedonians called thunder and lightning and magic and it is well known that the use of ordnance hath been in china above two thousand years the conditions of weapons and their improvement are first the fetching a far off for that outruns the danger as it is seen in ordnance and muskets secondly the strength of the percussion wherein likewise ordnance do exceed all arietations and ancient inventions the third is the 
 commodious use of them as that they may serve in all weathers that the carriage 
 may be light and manageable and the like 
 
 for the conduct of the war at the first men rested extremely upon number they did put the wars likewise upon main force and valour pointing days for pitched fields and so trying it out upon an even match and they were more ignorant in ranging and arraying their battles after they grew to rest upon number rather competent than vast they grew to advantages of place cunning diversions and the like and they grew more skilful in the ordering of their battles hi the youth of a state arms do flourish in the middle age of a state learning and then both of them together for a time in the declining age of a state mechanical arts and merchandise learning hath his infancy when it is but beginning and almost childish then his youth when it is luxuriant and juvenile then his strength of years when it is solid and reduced and lastly his old age when it waxeth dry and exhaust but it is not good to look too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude lest we become giddy as for the philology of them mat is but a circle of tales and therefore not fit for this writing 
 a fragment of an essay of fame the poets make fame a monster they describe her in part finely and elegantly and in part gravely and sentendously they say look how many feathers she hath so many eyes she hath underneath so many tongues so many voices she pricks up so many ears 
 
 this is a flourish there follow excellent parables as that she gathereth strength 
 in going that she goeth upon the ground and yet hideth her head in the clouds 
 that in the day time she sitteth in a watch tower and flieth most by night that she 
 mingleth things done with things not done and that she is a terror to great cities 
 but that which passeth all the rest is they do recount that the earth mother of 
 the giants that made war against jupiter and were by him destroyed thereupon in 
 an anger brought forth fame for certain it is that rebels figured by the giants 
 and seditious fames and libels are but brothers and sisters masculine and 
 feminine but now if a man can tame this matter and bring her to feed at the hand 
 and govern her and with her fly other ravening fowl and kill them it is somewhat 
 worth but we are infected with the style of the poets to speak now in a sad and 
 serious manner there is not in all the politics a place less handled and more 
 worthy to be handled than this of fame we will theretofore speak of these points 
 
 what are false fames and what are true fames and how they may be best discerned how fames may be sown and raised how they may be spread and multiplied and how they may be checked and laid dead and other things concerning the nature of fame 
 
 fame is of that force as there is scarcely any great action wherein it hath not a 
 great part especially in the war mucianus undid vitellius by a fame that he 
 scattered that vitellius had in purpose to remove the legions of syria into germany and the regions of germany into syria whereupon the legions of syria were infinitely inflamed julius caesar took pompey unprovided and laid asleep his industry and preparations by a fame that he cunningly gave out how own soldiers loved him not and being wearied with the wars and laden with the spoils of gaul would forsake him as soon as he came into italy livia settled all things for the succession of her son tiberius by continual giving out that her husband augustus was upon recovery and amendment and it is an usual thing with the bashaws to conceal the death of the great turk from the janissaries and men of war to save the sacking of constantinople and other towns as their manner is themistocles made xerxes king of persia post apace out ofgraecia by giving out that the grecians had a purpose to break his bridge of ships which he made athwart hellespont there be a thousand such like examples 
 and the more they are the less they need to be repeated because a man meeteth with them everywhere therefore let all wise governors have as great a watch and care over fames as they have of the actions and designs themselves

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter iii 
 
 a tempest in a skull 
 the reader has no doubt already divined that m madeleine is no other than jean valjean 
 we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has now come when we must take another look into it we do so not without emotion and trepidation 
 there is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more mysterious and more infinite 
 there is a spectacle more grand than the sea it is heaven 
 there is a spectacle more grand than heaven it is the inmost recesses of the soul 
 to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to a single man were it only in connection with the basest of men would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic conscience is the chaos of chimeras of lusts and of temptations the furnace of dreams the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium of sophisms it is the battlefield of the passions penetrate at certain hours past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that obscurity 
 there beneath that external silence battles of giants like those recorded in homer are in progress skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton visionary circles as in dante 
 what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life 
 alighieri one day met with a door before which he hesitated 
 here is one before us upon whose threshold we hesitate let us enter nevertheless 
 we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais from that moment forth he was as we have seen a totally different man what the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out it was more than a transformation it was a transfiguration 
 he succeeded in disappearing sold the silver reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir crept from town to town traversed france came to m sur m conceived the idea which we have mentioned accomplished what we have related succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible and thenceforth established at m sur m happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last he lived in peace reassured and hopeful having henceforth only two conceal his name and to sanctify his life to escape men and to return to god 
 these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions 
 in general they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life they turned him towards the gloom they rendered him kindly and simple they counselled him to the same things 
 sometimes however they conflicted 
 in that case as the reader will remember the man whom all the country of m sur m called m madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the security to his virtue 
 thus in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence he had preserved the candlesticks worn mourning for him summoned and interrogated all the little savoyards who passed that way collected information regarding the families at faverolles and saved old life despite the disquieting insinuations of javert 
 it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just that his first duty was not towards himself 
 at the same time it must be confessed nothing just like this had yet presented itself 
 never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating engaged in so serious a struggle he understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by javert when the latter entered his study 
 at the moment when that name which he had buried beneath so many layers was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks 
 he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault 
 he felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head as he listened to javert the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champmathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh 
 then it passed away and he said to himself we will see 
 we will see 
 he repressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism 
 it would be beautiful no doubt after the holy words after so many years of repentance and abnegation in the midst of a penitence admirably begun if this man had not flinched for an instant even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice at the bottom of which lay heaven that would have been beautiful but it was not thus 
 we must render an account of the things which went on in this soul and we can only tell what there was there he was carried away at first by the instinct of he rallied all his ideas in haste stifled his emotions took into consideration presence that great danger postponed all decision with the firmness of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler 
 he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquillity without 
 he took no preservative measures as they may be called 
 everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain 
 his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow 
 he repaired to bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his visit through a kindly instinct telling himself that he must behave thus and recommend her well to the sisters in case he should be obliged to be absent himself 
 he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to arras and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the tilbury from scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event 
 he dined with a good deal of appetite 
 on returning to his room he communed with himself 
 he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door 
 he feared lest something more should enter he was barricading himself against possibilities 
 a moment later he extinguished his light it embarrassed him 
 lt seemed to him as though he might be seen 
 by whom 
 alas 
 that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience 
 his conscience that is to say god 
 nevertheless he deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible 
 then he took possession of himself 
 he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark 
 where do i stand 
 am not i dreaming 
 what have i heard 
 is it really true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that manner 
 who can that champmathieu be 
 so he resembles me is it possible 
 when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspecting anything 
 what was i doing yesterday at this hour 
 what is there in this incident 
 what will the end be what is to be done 
 this was the torment in which he found himself 
 his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them 
 nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution 
 his head was burning 
 he went to the window and threw it wide open there were no stars in the sky 
 he returned and seated himself at the table 
 the first hour passed in this manner 
 gradually however vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the the whole situation but some of the details 
 he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it 
 this only caused an increase of his stupor 
 independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name 
 that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him knows perhaps even his new soul within him also 
 he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible 
 assuredly if any one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that that name would not menace him that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense that this rent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other result so far as he was concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and more respected than any one had told him that he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman 
 well all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things 
 his revery continued to grow clearer 
 he came more and more to an understanding of his position 
 it seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss 
 he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger a man unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more it was necessary that some one himself or that other man should fall into it he had only let things take their course 
 the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the galleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment be had a substitute that it appeared that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself being present in the galleys in the person of that champmathieu present in society under the name of m madeleine he had nothing more to fear provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that champmathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls once never to rise again 
 all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter 
 he hastily relighted his candle 
 well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is there in all that for me to think about 
 i am safe all is over 
 i had but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life and behold that door is walled up forever that javert who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me which had divined me good god and which followed me everywhere that frightful always making a point at me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail 
 henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he has his jean valjean who knows it is even probable that he will wish to leave town and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count for nothing in it 
 ah but where is the misfortune in this upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me 
 after all if it does bring harm to some one that is not my fault in the least 
 it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes it so to be evidently 
 have i the right to disarrange what it has arranged 
 what do i ask now why should i meddle 
 it does not concern me what 
 i am not satisfied but what more do i want 
 the goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to have now attained it is god who wills it i can do nothing against the will of god and why does god will it in order that i may continue what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have returned 
 really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this is evidently what he would have said to me it is settled let things take their course let the good god do as he likes 
 thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pace the room 
 come said he let us think no more about it my resolve is taken but he felt no joy 
 quite the reverse 
 one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore 
 the sailor calls it the tide the guilty man calls it remorse god upheaves the soul as he does the ocean 
 after the expiration of a few moments do what he would he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him 
 think as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on 
 before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation 
 it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living being who has not done it 
 it may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man and when it returns from conscience to thought it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter he said he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to self talks to self exclaims to self without breaking the external silence there is a great tumult everything about us talks except the mouth 
 the realities of the soul are none the less realities because they are not visible and palpable 
 so he asked himself where he stood 
 he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve 
 he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short was to do everything that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime 
 for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action 
 he spit it out with disgust 
 he continued to question himself 
 he asked himself severely what he had meant by this my object is attained 
 he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object to conceal his name 
 to deceive the police 
 was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done 
 had he not another and a grand object which was the true save not his person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a just man was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon shut the door on his past but he was not shutting it great god he was it by committing an infamous action 
 he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves 
 he was robbing another of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine he was becoming an assassin 
 he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man 
 he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys on the other hand to surrender himself to save that man struck down with so melancholy an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality 
 this must be done 
 he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted 
 there was no longer any need of saying what is the use 
 he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop beheld his conscience so he must go to arras deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the real one 
 alas that was the greatest of sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done sad fate he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men 
 well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us save this man 
 he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud 
 he took his books verified them and put them in order he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen 
 he wrote and sealed a letter and on the envelope it might have been read had there been any one in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte banker rue paris 
 he drew from his secretary a which contained several and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections 
 any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him 
 only occasionally did his lips move at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate 
 when he had finished the letter to m laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the and began his walk once more 
 his revery had not swerved from its course 
 he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance

 book three 
 chapter ix 
 
 the day after the review boris in his best uniform and with his comrade best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkonski wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could preferably that of adjutant to some important personage a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is all very well for rostov whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he reflected 
 he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two emperors were living with their suites households and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world 
 he knew no one and despite his smart uniform all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military men seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be aware of his existence at the quarters of the commander in chief kutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it next day november after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering the house occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in and boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing but in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the door was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another the red stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his head laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on the clavichord sang the tune bolkonski was not there none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing boris the one who was writing and whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went to the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals 
 when he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening to an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost on tiptoe with a obsequious expression on his purple face reporting something 
 very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris prince andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile 
 at that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised that in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was another more important subordination which made this general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more than ever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand 
 i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions when germans start being accurate no end to it 
 boris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known but it the first time he had heard name or even the term dispositions 
 well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have been thinking about you 
 yes i was thinking for some reason boris could not help blushing of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince kuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards be in action he added as if in apology 
 all right all right talk it over replied prince andrew only let me report this business and i shall be at your disposal 
 while prince andrew went to report about the general that gentleman evidently not sharing boris conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away and waited impatiently for prince return from the commander in room 
 you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was no use your going to the commander in chief he would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought boris but nothing more would come of it there will soon be a battalion of us and adjutants but this is what do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it the fact is that now kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing everything is now centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun 
 prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him he very readily took up boris cause and went with him to dolgorukov 
 it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz occupied by the emperors and their retinues 
 that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary to the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by boris arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the council at which the party of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantages were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened was undertaking nothing 
 dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protege but prince dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to boris and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french 
 ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with russian valor what more could be wished for 
 so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonski 
 and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantly 
 is that so and what did he say inquired bolkonski 
 what can he say and so on merely to gain time i tell you he is in our hands certain but what was most amusing he continued with a sudden laugh was that we could not think how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte 
 but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkonski 
 just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you know bilibin a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him as usurper and enemy of mankind 
 dolgorukov laughed merrily 
 only that said bolkonski 
 all the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the address he is a wise and clever fellow 
 what was it 
 to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement francais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction good it 
 yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski 
 oh yes very much my brother knows him dined with him the present emperor more than once in paris and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist you know a combination of french adroitness and italian do you know the tale about him and count markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful 
 and the talkative dolgorukov turning now to boris now to prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassador purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching 
 delightful said bolkonski but i have come to you prince as a petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before prince andrew could finish an came in to summon dolgorukov to the emperor 
 oh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and boris you know i should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of sincere and animated levity but you see another time 
 boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out into the corridor and met coming out of the door of the room by which dolgorukov had entered a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his face gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor 
 who was that asked boris 
 he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of men the minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such men as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out of the palace 
 next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of austerlitz boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the golden treasure 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the wife went into the church she saw the new altar 
 with the painted pictures and the carved angels those upon the canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful as the carved ones and they were painted and gilt into the bargain their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine lovely to behold but the real 
 sunshine was more beautiful still it shone redder clearer through 
 the dark trees when the sun went down it was lovely thus to look 
 at the sunshine of heaven and she looked at the red sun and she 
 thought about it so deeply and thought of the little one whom the 
 stork was to bring and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful and looked and looked and wished that the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it so that it might at least become like one of the 
 shining angels over the altar 
 
 and when she really had the little child in her arms and held 
 it up to its father then it was like one of the angels in the 
 church to behold with hair like gold the gleam of the setting sun 
 was upon it 
 
 my golden treasure my riches my sunshine said the mother and 
 she kissed the shining locks and it sounded like music and song in 
 the room of the drummer and there was joy and life and movement 
 
 the drummer beat a roll a roll of joy and the drum said the 
 that was beaten when there was a fire in the town 
 red hair the little fellow has red hair believe the drum and 
 not what your mother says dub dub 
 
 and the town repeated what the had said 
 the boy was taken to church the boy was christened there was 
 nothing much to be said about his name he was called peter the whole town and the drum too called him peter the boy with the red hair but his mother kissed his red hair and called him her 
 golden treasure 
 
 in the hollow way in the clayey bank many had scratched their 
 names as a remembrance 
 
 celebrity is always something said the drummer and so he 
 scratched his own name there and his little name likewise 
 and the swallows came they had on their long journey seen 
 more durable characters engraven on rocks and on the walls of the 
 temples in hindostan mighty deeds of great kings immortal names 
 so old that no one now could read or speak them remarkable celebrity 
 
 in the clayey bank the martens built their nest they bored 
 holes in the deep declivity and the splashing rain and the thin 
 mist came and crumbled and washed the names away and the name also and that of his little son 
 
 name will last a full year and a half longer said the 
 father 
 
 fool thought the but it only said dub dub dub 
 
 
 he was a boy full of life and gladness this son with 
 the red hair he had a lovely voice he could sing and he sang like a 
 bird in the woodland there was melody and yet no melody 
 
 he must become a chorister boy said his mother he shall 
 sing in the church and stand among the beautiful gilded angels who 
 are like him 
 
 fiery cat said some of the witty ones of the town 
 the drum heard that from the neighbors wives 
 
 go home peter cried the street boys if you sleep in 
 the garret be a fire in the house and the will 
 have to be beaten 
 
 look out for the drumsticks replied peter and small as he 
 was he ran up boldly and gave the foremost such a punch in the 
 body with his fist that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over 
 and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly 
 
 the town musician was very genteel and fine he was the son of the 
 royal he was very fond of peter and would sometimes 
 take him to his home and he gave him a violin and taught him to play 
 it it seemed as if the whole art lay in the fingers and he 
 wanted to be more than a drummer he wanted to become musician to 
 the town 
 
 be a soldier said peter for he was still quite a little 
 lad and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to carry a 
 gun and to be able to march one two one two and to wear a uniform and a sword 
 
 ah you learn to long for the drum dum dum said 
 the drum 
 
 yes if he could only march his way up to be a general observed 
 his father but before he can do that there must be war 
 
 heaven forbid said his mother 
 
 we have nothing to lose remarked the father 
 
 yes we have my boy she retorted 
 
 but suppose he came back a general said the father 
 
 without arms and legs cried the mother no i would rather 
 keep my golden treasure with me 
 
 drum dum dum the and all the other drums were 
 beating for war had come the soldiers all set out and the son of 
 the drummer followed them golden treasure 
 
 the mother wept the father in fancy saw him famous the town 
 musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war but should 
 stay at home and learn music 
 
 said the soldiers and little peter laughed but 
 when one of them sometimes said to another foxey he would bite his teeth together and look another way into the wide world he did not care for the nickname 
 
 the boy was active pleasant of speech and that 
 is the best canteen said his old comrades 
 
 and many a night he had to sleep under the open sky wet through 
 with the driving rain or the falling mist but his good humor never 
 forsook him the sounded all up all up 
 yes he was certainly born to be a drummer 
 
 the day of battle dawned the sun had not yet risen but the 
 morning was come the air was cold the battle was hot there was mist in the air but still more the bullets and shells 
 flew over the soldiers heads and into their heads into their bodies 
 and limbs but still they pressed forward here or there one or 
 other of them would sink on his knees with bleeding temples and a 
 face as white as chalk the little drummer still kept his healthy 
 color he had suffered no damage he looked cheerfully at the dog of 
 the regiment which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole thing 
 had been got up for his amusement and as if the bullets were only 
 flying about that he might have a game of play with them 
 
 march forward march this was the word of command for the 
 drum the word had not yet been given to fall back though they 
 might have done so and perhaps there would have been much sense in it and now at last the word retire was given but our little 
 drummer beat forward march for he had understood the command thus and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum that was a good roll and proved the summons to victory for the men who had already begun to give way 
 
 life and limb were lost in the battle bombshells tore away the 
 flesh in red strips bombshells lit up into a terrible glow the 
 strawheaps to which the wounded had dragged themselves to lie 
 untended for many hours perhaps for all the hours they had to live 
 no use thinking of it and yet one cannot help thinking of 
 it even far away in the peaceful town the drummer and his wife 
 also thought of it for peter was at the war 
 
 now tired of these complaints said the 
 again the day of battle dawned the sun had not yet risen but 
 it was morning the drummer and his wife were asleep they had been talking about their son as indeed they did almost every night 
 for he was out yonder in hand and the father dreamt that the 
 war was over that the soldiers had returned home and that peter wore a silver cross on his breast but the mother dreamt that she had 
 gone into the church and had seen the painted pictures and the carved angels with the gilded hair and her own dear boy the golden treasure of her heart who was standing among the angels in white robes singing so sweetly as surely only the angels can sing and that he had soared up with them into the sunshine and nodded so kindly at his mother 
 
 my golden treasure she cried out and she awoke now the 
 good god has taken him to himself she folded her hands and hid 
 her face in the cotton curtains of the bed and wept where does he 
 rest now among the many in the big grave that they have dug for the 
 dead perhaps in the water in the marsh nobody knows his 
 grave no holy words have been read over it and the prayer 
 went inaudibly over her lips she bowed her head and was so weary 
 that she went to sleep 
 and the days went by in life as in dreams 
 
 it was evening over the a rainbow spread which 
 touched the forest and the deep marsh 
 
 it has been said and is preserved in popular belief that where 
 the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried a golden 
 treasure and here there was one no one but his mother thought of the little drummer and therefore she dreamt of him 
 and the days went by in life as in dreams 
 not a hair of his head had been hurt not a golden hair 
 there he is the drum might have said and his mother might have sung if she had seen or dreamt it 
 with hurrah and song adorned with green wreaths of victory 
 they came home as the war was at an end and peace had been signed 
 
 the dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large bounds and made the way three times as long for himself as it really was 
 
 and days and weeks went by and peter came into his parents room 
 he was as brown as a wild man and his eyes were bright and his 
 face beamed like sunshine and his mother held him in her arms she 
 kissed his lips his forehead and his red hair she had her boy 
 back again he had not a silver cross on his breast as his father had 
 dreamt but he had sound limbs a thing the mother had not dreamt 
 and what a rejoicing was there they laughed and they wept and peter embraced the old 
 
 there stands the old skeleton still he said 
 and the father beat a roll upon it 
 
 one would think that a great fire had broken out here said 
 the bright day fire in the heart golden treasure skrat 
 
 and what then what then ask the town musician 
 far outgrowing the drum he said peter will be greater 
 than i 
 
 and yet he was the son of a royal but all that he 
 had learned in half a lifetime peter learned in half a year 
 
 there was something so merry about him something so truly 
 his eyes gleamed and his hair gleamed too there was no denying that 
 
 he ought to have his hair dyed said the wife 
 
 that answered capitally with the daughter and she got 
 a husband 
 
 but her hair turned as green as duckweed and was always having 
 to be colored up 
 
 she knows how to manage for herself said the neighbors and so 
 can peter he comes to the most genteel houses even to the 
 where he gives miss charlotte lessons 
 he could play he could play fresh out of his heart the most 
 charming pieces that had never been put upon he played in the bright nights and in the dark nights too the neighbors 
 declared it was unbearable and the was of the same opinion 
 
 he played until his thoughts soared up and burst forth in great 
 plans for the future 
 
 to be famous 
 
 and charlotte sat at the piano her delicate fingers 
 danced over the keys and made them ring into heart it seemed too much for him to bear and this happened not once but many times and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the 
 white hand and kissed it and looked into her great brown eyes 
 heaven knows what he said but we may be allowed to guess at it 
 charlotte blushed to guess at it she reddened from brow to neck 
 and answered not a single word and then strangers came into the room and one of them was the state son he had a lofty white forehead and carried it so high that it seemed to go back into his neck and peter sat by her a long time and she looked at him with 
 gentle eyes 
 
 at home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world and 
 of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his violin 
 
 to be famous 
 
 said the peter 
 has gone clear out of his wits i think there must be a fire in the 
 house 
 
 next day the mother went to market 
 
 shall i tell you news peter she asked when she came home a 
 capital piece of news charlotte has engaged herself 
 to the state son the betrothal took place yesterday 
 evening 
 
 no cried peter and he sprang up from his chair but his mother 
 persisted in saying yes she had heard it from the wife 
 whose husband had it from the own mouth 
 and peter became as pale as death and sat down again 
 
 good heaven the matter with you asked his mother 
 
 nothing nothing only leave me to myself he answered but the 
 tears were running down his cheeks 
 
 my sweet child my golden treasure cried the mother and she 
 wept but the sang not out loud but inwardly 
 
 gone gone and now the song is done 
 but the song was not done there were many more verses in it long 
 verses the most beautiful verses the golden treasures of a life 
 she behaves like a mad woman said the wife all the 
 world is to see the letters she gets from her golden treasure and 
 to read the words that are written in the papers about his violin 
 playing and he sends her money too and very useful to her 
 since she has been a widow 
 
 he plays before emperors and kings said the town musician i 
 never had that fortune but my pupil and he does not forget 
 his old master 
 
 and his mother said 
 
 his father dreamt that peter came home from the war with a silver 
 cross he did not gain one in the war but it is still more 
 difficult to gain one in this way now he has the cross of honor if 
 his father had only lived to see it 
 
 grown famous said the and all his native town 
 said the same thing for the son peter with the red hair 
 peter whom they had known as a little boy running about in wooden 
 shoes and then as a drummer playing for the dancers was become 
 famous 
 
 he played at our house before he played in the presence of 
 kings said the wife at that time he was quite 
 smitten with charlotte he was always of an aspiring turn at that 
 time he was saucy and an enthusiast my husband laughed when he 
 heard of the foolish affair and now our charlotte is a state 
 wife 
 
 a golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of the 
 poor child who had beaten the roll as a drummer a roll of victory 
 for those who had been ready to retreat there was a golden treasure 
 in his bosom the power of sound it burst forth on his violin as if 
 the instrument had been a complete organ and as if all the elves of a 
 midsummer night were dancing across the strings in its sounds were 
 heard the piping of the thrush and the full clear note of the human 
 voice therefore the sound brought rapture to every heart and carried 
 his name triumphant through the land that was a great firebrand 
 the firebrand of inspiration 
 
 and then he looks so splendid said the young ladies and the old 
 ladies too and the oldest of all procured an album for famous locks 
 of hair wholly and solely that she might beg a lock of his rich 
 splendid hair that treasure that golden treasure 
 
 and the son came into the poor room of the drummer elegant as a 
 prince happier than a king his eyes were as clear and his face was 
 as radiant as sunshine and he held his mother in his arms and she 
 kissed his mouth and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for 
 joy and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room at the 
 cupboard with the and at the he nodded at the 
 where he had slept as a little boy but the old 
 he brought out and dragged it into the middle of the 
 room and said to it and to his mother 
 
 my father would have beaten a famous roll this evening now i 
 must do it 
 
 and he beat a thundering on the instrument and the drum 
 felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with exultation 
 
 he has a splendid touch said the drum a remembrance of 
 him now that will last i expect that the same thing will happen to 
 his mother from pure joy over her golden treasure 
 and this is the story of the golden treasure 
 
 the end

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter iii 
 
 in the same way he beheld as though they had passed before him in visible forms the two ideas which had up to that time formed the double rule of his concealment of his name the sanctification of his life 
 for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separated them 
 he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was necessarily good while the other might become bad that the first was and that the other was personality that the one said my neighbor and that the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other from darkness 
 they were antagonistic 
 he saw them in conflict 
 in proportion as he meditated they grew before the eyes of his spirit they had now attained colossal statures and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the midst of the darkness and the lights a goddess and a giant contending 
 he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand 
 he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that champmathieu marked the second after the grand crisis the grand test 
 but the fever allayed for an instant gradually resumed possession of him 
 a thousand thoughts traversed his mind but they continued to fortify him in his resolution 
 one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter too keenly that after all this champmathieu was not interesting and that he had actually been guilty of theft 
 he answered himself 
 if this man has indeed stolen a few apples that means a month in prison 
 it is a long way from that to the galleys and who knows 
 did he steal 
 has it been proved 
 the name of jean valjean overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proofs do not the attorneys for the crown always proceed in this manner he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict 
 in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he denounced himself the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he had done for the district and that they would have mercy on him 
 but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life 
 he turned aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere he told himself that he must do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it that if he allowed things to take their own course if he remained at m sur m his consideration his good name his good works the deference and veneration paid to him his charity his wealth his popularity his virtue would be seasoned with a crime and what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing while if he accomplished his sacrifice a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys the post the iron necklet the green cap unceasing toil and pitiless shame 
 at length he told himself that it must be so that his destiny was thus allotted that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high that in any case he must make his choice 
 virtue without and abomination within or holiness within and infamy without 
 the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail but his brain grow weary 
 he began to think of other things of indifferent matters in spite of himself 
 the veins in his temples throbbed violently he still paced to and fro midnight sounded first from the parish church then from the he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks and compared the sounds of the two bells he recalled in this connection the fact that a few days previously he had seen in an shop an ancient clock for sale upon which was written the name de romainville 
 he was cold he lighted a small fire it did not occur to him to close the window 
 in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this 
 ah yes he said to himself i had resolved to inform against myself 
 and then all of a sudden he thought of fantine 
 hold said he and what about that poor woman 
 here a fresh crisis declared itself 
 fantine by appearing thus abruptly in his revery produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect 
 he exclaimed 
 ah but i have hitherto considered no one but myself it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself to conceal my person or to save my soul to be a despicable and respected magistrate or an infamous and venerable convict it is i it is always i and nothing but i but good god all this is egotism these are diverse forms of egotism but it is egotism all the same what if i were to think a little about others 
 the highest holiness is to think of others come let us examine the matter the i excepted the i effaced the i forgotten what would be the result of all this 
 what if i denounce myself 
 i am arrested this champmathieu is released i am put back in the galleys that is well and what then 
 what is going on here 
 ah here is a country a town here are factories an industry workers both men and women aged grandsires children poor people 
 all this i have created all these i provide with their living everywhere where there is a smoking chimney it is i who have placed the brand on the hearth and meat in the pot i have created ease circulation credit before me there was nothing i have elevated vivified informed with life fecundated stimulated enriched the whole lacking me the soul is lacking i take myself off everything dies and this woman who has suffered so much who possesses so many merits in spite of her fall the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been 
 and that child whom i meant to go in search of whom i have promised to her mother do i not also owe something to this woman in reparation for the evil which i have done her if i disappear what happens 
 the mother dies the child becomes what it can that is what will take place if i denounce myself if i do not denounce myself come let us see how it will be if i do not denounce myself 
 after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and he answered himself calmly 
 well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce he has stolen 
 there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft for he has 
 i remain here i go on in ten years i shall have made ten millions i scatter them over the country i have nothing of my own what is that to me it is not for myself that i am doing it the prosperity of all goes on augmenting industries are aroused and animated factories and shops are multiplied families a hundred families a thousand families are happy the district becomes populated villages spring up where there were only farms before farms rise where there was nothing wretchedness disappears and with wretchedness debauchery prostitution theft murder all vices disappear all crimes 
 and this poor mother rears her child and behold a whole country rich and honest 
 ah 
 i was a fool i was absurd what was that i was saying about denouncing myself i really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything what because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous this is melodrama after all because i should have thought of no one but myself the idea for the sake of saving from a punishment a trifle exaggerated perhaps but just at bottom no one knows whom a thief a evidently a whole must perish a poor woman must die in the hospital a poor little girl must die in the street like dogs ah this is abominable and without the mother even having seen her child once more almost without the having known her mother and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an who most assuredly has deserved the galleys for something else if not for that fine scruples indeed which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel and which sacrifice a whole population mothers wives children this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me and who is no doubt blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers those peoples are rascals and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures and i was going off to denounce myself and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly let us put it at the worst 
 suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this and that my conscience will reproach me for it some day to accept for the good of others these reproaches which weigh only on myself this evil action which compromises my soul alone in that lies in that alone there is virtue 
 he rose and resumed his march this time he seemed to be content 
 diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth truths are found only in the depths of thought 
 it seemed to him that after having descended into these depths after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows he had at last found one of these diamonds one of these truths and that he now held it in his hand and he was dazzled as he gazed upon it 
 yes he thought this is right i am on the right road i have the solution i must end by holding fast to something my resolve is taken let things take their course let us no longer vacillate let us no longer hang back this is for the interest of all not for my own i am madeleine and madeleine i remain 
 woe to the man who is jean valjean 
 i am no longer he i do not know that man i no longer know anything it turns out that some one is jean valjean at the present moment let him look out for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on a head so much the worse for that head 
 he looked into the little mirror which hung above his and said 
 hold it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man now 
 he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short 
 come he said i must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear witness against me it is settled all these things must disappear 
 he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a small key he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the a secret receptacle opened a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the in this there were some rags a blue linen blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends 
 those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through d in october could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit 
 he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in order to remind himself continually of his but he had concealed all that came from the galleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen 
 he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all rags cudgel knapsack into the fire 
 he closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it 
 after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow 
 everything was on fire the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber 
 as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous rags which it contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes by bending over one could have readily recognized a doubt the piece stolen from the little savoyard 
 he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same step 
 all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the through the glow 
 hold he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them they must be destroyed also 
 he seized the two candlesticks 
 there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal 
 he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment 
 he felt a sense of real comfort 
 how good warmth is said he 
 he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks 
 a minute more and they were both in the fire 
 at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting 
 jean valjean 
 jean valjean 
 his hair rose upright 
 he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing 
 yes it finish said the voice 
 complete what you are about 
 destroy these candlesticks 
 annihilate this souvenir forget the bishop 
 forget everything 
 destroy this champmathieu do that is right 
 applaud yourself 
 so it is settled resolved fixed agreed 
 here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man whose whole misfortune lies in your name upon whom your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abjectness and horror 
 that is good be an honest man yourself remain monsieur le maire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent rear the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will bear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys 
 yes it is well arranged thus 
 ah wretch 
 the perspiration streamed from his brow 
 he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks 
 but that within him which had spoken had not finished 
 the voice continued 
 jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark 
 well listen infamous man 
 all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven and only the malediction will ascend to god 
 this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience had gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very ear 
 it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside of him 
 he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror 
 is there any one here he demanded aloud in utter bewilderment 
 then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot 
 how stupid i am 
 there can be no one 
 there was some one but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see 
 he placed the candlesticks on the 
 then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and awoke him with a start 
 this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of place 
 after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position 
 he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn 
 the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal 
 what a fatality 
 what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his position 
 there was a moment when he reflected on the future 
 denounce himself great god 
 deliver himself up 
 with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up once more 
 he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty 
 he should never more stroll in the fields he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of may he should never more bestow alms on the little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber 
 everything seemed charming to him at that moment 
 never again should he read those books never more should he write on that little table of white wood his old portress the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning 
 great god instead of that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well 
 at his age after having been what he was if he were only young again but to be addressed in his old age as thou by any one who pleased to be searched by the to receive the cudgellings to wear shoes on his bare feet to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang to submit to the curiosity of strangers who would be told 
 that man yonder is the famous jean valjean who was mayor of m sur m and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with lassitude their green caps drawn over their eyes to remount two by two the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the whip oh what misery 
 can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent being and become as monstrous as the human heart 
 and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery 
 should he remain in paradise and become a demon 
 should he return to hell and become an angel 
 what was to be done 
 great god what was to be done 
 the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him 
 his ideas began to grow confused once more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair 
 the name of romainville recurred incessantly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past 
 he thought that romainville was a little grove near paris where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april 
 he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly 
 he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone 
 at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind 
 he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue 
 ought he to denounce himself 
 ought he to hold his peace 
 he could not manage to see anything distinctly 
 the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished one after the other into smoke 
 he only felt that to whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness or the agony of his virtue 
 alas all his resolution had again taken possession of him he was no further advanced than at the beginning 
 thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand while the quivered in the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars

 book three 
 chapter x 
 
 at dawn on the sixteenth of november squadron in which nicholas rostov served and which was in prince detachment moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad rostov saw the cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration and dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before action which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood at nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in convoyed by a sontnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over and though not big had been a successful engagement the men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and adjutants as they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed 
 come here wostov dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food 
 the officers gathered round canteen eating and talking 
 there they are bringing another cried one of the officers indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two cossacks 
 one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had taken from the prisoner 
 sell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacks 
 if you like your honor 
 the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers addressing first one then another he said he would not have been taken it was not his fault but the who had sent him to seize some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there and at every word he added but hurt my little horse and stroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to us 
 the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it 
 but hurt my little horse said the alsatian to rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar 
 rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money 
 alley alley said the cossack touching the arm to make him go on 
 the emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars 
 all began to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyone was in his place waiting 
 rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the moment of meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he was ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more festive around him nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the voice 
 the pavlograd hussars he inquired 
 the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to that which had said the pavlograd hussars 
 the emperor drew level with rostov and halted face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested the liveliness of a boy and yet it was the face of the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the eyes met and rested on them for not more than two seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everything at any rate his eyes gazed for about two seconds into face a gentle mild light poured from them then all at once he raised his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot and galloped on 
 the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action 
 this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and were retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had passed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau itself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in the market place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head the wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity to the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his left foot began convulsively tapping the side with the spur and how the horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned 
 gently gently you do it more gently said the emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away 
 rostov saw tears filling the eyes and heard him as he was riding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what a terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre 
 the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight of the lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing the gratitude was announced to the vanguard rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major and rostov who had already drunk enough at the end of the feast proposed the health not our sovereign the emperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health of our sovereign that good enchanting and great man let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the french 
 if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as at schon grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we will all die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying it right i have drunk a good deal but that is how i feel and so do you too to the health of alexander the first hurrah 
 hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers 
 and the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the rostov 
 when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten filled others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire waving his uplifted arm 
 lads to our sovereign the emperor and victory over our enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old baritone 
 the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts 
 late that night when all had separated denisov with his short hand patted his favorite rostov on the shoulder 
 as no one to fall in love with on campaign fallen in love with the tsar he said 
 denisov make fun of it cried rostov it is such a lofty beautiful feeling such a 
 i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove 
 no you understand 
 and rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of what happiness it would be to die not in saving the life he did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyes he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian arms and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the russian arms

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the goloshes of fortune 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 a beginning 
 in a house in copenhagen not far from the new market a 
 very large party had assembled the host and his family expecting 
 no doubt to receive invitations in return one half of the company 
 were already seated at the the other half seemed to be 
 waiting the result of their question well how shall we 
 amuse ourselves 
 
 conversation followed which after a while began to prove very 
 entertaining among other subjects it turned upon the events of the 
 middle ages which some persons maintained were more full of 
 interest than our own times counsellor knapp defended this opinion so warmly that the lady of the house immediately went over to his side and both exclaimed against essays on ancient and modern times in which the preference is given to our own the counsellor considered the times of the danish king hans as the noblest and happiest 
 
 the conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment 
 by the arrival of a newspaper which did not however contain much 
 worth reading and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to 
 the in which cloaks sticks and goloshes were carefully 
 placed here sat two maidens one young and the other old as if they 
 had come and were waiting to accompany their mistresses home but on looking at them more closely it could easily be seen that they were 
 no common servants their shapes were too graceful their 
 complexions too delicate and the cut of their dresses much too 
 elegant they were two fairies the younger was not fortune herself 
 but the chambermaid of one of attendants who carries 
 about her more trifling gifts the elder one who was named care 
 looked rather gloomy she always goes about to perform her own 
 business in person for then she knows it is properly done they 
 were telling each other where they had been during the day the 
 messenger of fortune had only transacted a few unimportant matters 
 for instance she had preserved a new bonnet from a shower of rain 
 and obtained for an honest man a bow from a titled nobody and so 
 on but she had something extraordinary to relate after all 
 i must tell you said she that is my birthday and in 
 honor of it i have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes to 
 introduce amongst mankind these goloshes have the property of 
 making every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place he 
 wishes or that he exists at any period every wish is fulfilled at 
 the moment it is expressed so that for once mankind have the chance 
 of being happy 
 
 no replied care you may depend upon it that whoever puts on 
 those goloshes will be very unhappy and bless the moment in which 
 he can get rid of them 
 
 what are you thinking of replied the other now see i will 
 place them by the door some one will take them instead of his own 
 and he will be the happy man 
 
 this was the end of their conversation 
 
 counsellor 
 what happened to the counsellor 
 it was late when counsellor knapp lost in thought about the times 
 of king hans desired to return home and fate so ordered it that he 
 put on the goloshes of fortune instead of his own and walked out into the east street through the magic power of the goloshes he was at once carried back three hundred years to the times of king hans for which he had been longing when he put them on therefore he immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of the street which in those days possessed no pavement 
 
 why this is horrible how dreadfully dirty it is said the 
 counsellor and the whole pavement has vanished and the lamps are all out 
 
 the moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the thick 
 foggy air and all the objects around him were confused together in 
 the darkness at the nearest corner a lamp hung before a picture of 
 the madonna but the light it gave was almost useless for he only 
 perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted 
 figures of the mother and child 
 
 that is most likely a museum of art thought he and they 
 have forgotten to take down the sign 
 
 two men in the dress of olden times passed by him 
 
 what odd figures thought he they must be returning from 
 some masquerade 
 
 suddenly he heard the sound of a drum and fifes and then a 
 blazing light from torches shone upon him the counsellor stared 
 with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him first came a whole troop of drummers beating their drums very cleverly they were followed by with longbows and crossbows the principal person in the procession was a gentleman the astonished counsellor asked what it all meant and who the gentleman might be 
 
 that is the bishop of zealand 
 
 good gracious he exclaimed what in the world has happened 
 to the bishop what can he be thinking about then he shook his 
 head and said it cannot possibly be the bishop himself 
 
 while musing on this strange affair and without looking to the 
 right or left he walked on through east street and over highbridge 
 place the bridge which he supposed led to palace square was nowhere to be found but instead he saw a bank and some shallow water and two people who sat in a boat 
 
 does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the holm asked one 
 to the holm exclaimed the counsellor not knowing in what age 
 he was now existing i want to go to haven in little 
 turf street the men stared at him pray tell me where the bridge 
 is said he it is shameful that the lamps are not lighted here and 
 it is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh but the more he 
 talked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other 
 i understand your outlandish talk he cried at last 
 angrily turning his back upon them he could not however find the 
 bridge nor any railings 
 
 what a scandalous condition this place is in said he never 
 certainly had he found his own times so miserable as on this evening 
 i think it will be better for me to take a coach but where are 
 they there was not one to be seen i shall be obliged to go back to the new market said he where there are plenty of 
 carriages standing or i shall never reach haven then he 
 went towards east street and had nearly passed through it when the 
 moon burst forth from a cloud 
 
 dear me what have they been erecting here he cried as he 
 caught sight of the east gate which in olden times used to stand at 
 the end of east street however he found an opening through which 
 he passed and came out upon where he expected to find the new market 
 
 nothing was to be seen but an open meadow surrounded by a few bushes through which ran a broad canal or stream a few wooden booths for the accommodation of dutch watermen stood on the opposite shore 
 
 either i behold a fata morgana or i must be tipsy groaned 
 the counsellor what can it be what is the matter with me he 
 turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill in walking 
 through the street this time he examined the houses more closely 
 he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster and many 
 had only a thatched roof 
 
 i am certainly all wrong said he with a sigh and yet i only 
 drank one glass of punch but i cannot bear even that and it was very 
 foolish to give us punch and hot salmon i shall speak about it to our 
 hostess the lady suppose i were to go back now and say how ill i feel i fear it would look so ridiculous and it is not very 
 likely that i should find any one up then he looked for the house 
 but it was not in existence 
 
 this is really frightful i cannot even recognize east street 
 
 not a shop to be seen nothing but old wretched 
 houses just as if i were at roeskilde or ringstedt oh i really must 
 be ill it is no use to stand upon ceremony but where in the world is 
 the house there is a house but it is not his and people 
 still up in it i can hear oh dear i certainly am very queer as he 
 reached the door he saw a light and went in it was a 
 tavern of the olden times and seemed a kind of beershop the room had the appearance of a dutch interior a number of people consisting of seamen copenhagen citizens and a few scholars sat in deep conversation over their mugs and took very little notice of the new comer 
 
 pardon me said the counsellor addressing the landlady i do 
 not feel quite well and i should be much obliged if you will send for 
 a fly to take me to haven the woman stared at him and 
 shook her head then she spoke to him in german the counsellor 
 supposed from this that she did not understand danish he therefore 
 repeated his request in german this as well as his singular dress 
 convinced the woman that he was a foreigner she soon understood 
 however that he did not find himself quite well and therefore 
 brought him a mug of water it had something of the taste of seawater certainly although it had been drawn from the well outside 
 then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand drew a deep breath and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him 
 
 is that number of the day he asked quite mechanically as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper 
 
 she did not understand what he meant but she handed him the sheet it was a woodcut representing a meteor which had appeared in the town of cologne 
 
 that is very old said the counsellor becoming quite cheerful 
 at the sight of this antique drawing where did you get this singular 
 sheet it is very interesting although the whole affair is a fable 
 meteors are easily explained in these days they are northern 
 lights which are often seen and are no doubt caused by electricity 
 those who sat near him and heard what he said looked at him in 
 great astonishment and one of them rose took off his hat respectfully and said in a very serious manner you must certainly 
 be a very learned man monsieur 
 
 oh no replied the counsellor i can only discourse on topics 
 which every one should understand 
 
 modestia is a beautiful virtue said the man moreover i 
 must add to your speech mihi secus videtur yet in this case i would 
 suspend my judicium 
 
 may i ask to whom i have the pleasure of speaking 
 
 i am a bachelor of divinity said the man this answer satisfied 
 the counsellor the title agreed with the dress 
 
 this is surely thought he an old village schoolmaster a 
 perfect original such as one meets with sometimes even in jutland 
 
 this is not certainly a locus docendi began the man still i 
 must beg you to continue the conversation you must be well read in 
 ancient lore 
 
 oh yes replied the counsellor i am very fond of reading 
 useful old books and modern ones as well with the exception of 
 stories of which we really have more than enough 
 
 stories asked the bachelor 
 
 yes i mean the new novels that we have at the present day 
 
 oh replied the man with a smile and yet they are very witty 
 and are much read at court the king likes especially the romance of 
 messeurs iffven and gaudian which describes king arthur and his 
 knights of the round table he has joked about it with the gentlemen 
 of his court 
 
 well i have certainly not read that replied the counsellor i 
 suppose it is quite new and published by heiberg 
 
 no answered the man it is not by heiberg godfred von 
 gehman brought it out 
 
 oh is he the publisher that is a very old name said the 
 counsellor was it not the name of the first publisher in denmark 
 
 yes and he is our first printer and publisher now replied 
 the scholar 
 
 so far all had passed off very well but now one of the citizens 
 began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been raging a few 
 years before meaning the plague of the counsellor thought he 
 referred to the cholera and they could discuss this without finding 
 out the mistake the war in was spoken of as quite recent the 
 english pirates had taken some ships in the channel in and the 
 counsellor supposing they referred to these agreed with them in 
 finding fault with the english the rest of the talk however was not 
 so agreeable every moment one contradicted the other the good 
 bachelor appeared very ignorant for the simplest remark of the 
 counsellor seemed to him either too bold or too fantastic they stared 
 at each other and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in latin 
 in the hope of being better understood but it was all useless 
 how are you now asked the landlady pulling the 
 sleeve 
 
 then his recollection returned to him in the course of 
 conversation he had forgotten all that had happened previously 
 goodness me where am i said he it bewildered him as he 
 thought of it 
 
 we will have some claret or mead or bremen beer said one of 
 the guests will you drink with us 
 
 two maids came in one of them had a cap on her head of two 
 colors they poured out the wine bowed their heads and withdrew 
 the counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him what is this 
 what does it mean said he but he was obliged to drink with them 
 for they overpowered the good man with their politeness he became 
 at last desperate and when one of them said he was tipsy he did 
 not doubt the word in the least only begged them to get a 
 droschky and then they thought he was speaking the muscovite 
 language never before had he been in such rough and vulgar company 
 
 one might believe that the country was going back to heathenism 
 he observed this is the most terrible moment of my life 
 
 just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under the 
 table and so creep to the door he tried it but before he reached 
 the entry the rest discovered what he was about and seized him by 
 the feet when luckily for him off came the goloshes and with 
 them vanished the whole enchantment the counsellor now saw quite 
 plainly a lamp and a large building behind it everything looked 
 familiar and beautiful he was in east street as it now appears he 
 lay with his legs turned towards a porch and just by him sat the 
 watchman asleep 
 
 is it possible that i have been lying here in the street 
 dreaming said he yes this is east street how beautifully 
 bright and gay it looks it is quite shocking that one glass of 
 punch should have upset me like this 
 
 two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky which was to drive 
 him to haven he thought of all the terror and anxiety 
 which he had undergone and felt thankful from his heart for the 
 reality and comfort of modern times which with all their errors 
 were far better than those in which he so lately found himself 
 
 the adventures 
 well i declare there lies a pair of goloshes said the 
 watchman no doubt they belong to the lieutenant who lives up 
 stairs they are lying just by his door gladly would the honest 
 man have rung and given them in for a light was still burning but 
 he did not wish to disturb the other people in the house so he let 
 them lie these things must keep the feet very warm said he 
 they are of such nice soft leather then he tried them on and 
 they fitted his feet exactly now said he how droll things are in 
 this world that man can lie down in his warm bed but he does not do so there he goes pacing up and down the room he ought to be a happy man he has neither wife nor children and he goes out into company every evening oh i wish i were he then i should be a happy man 
 
 as he uttered this wish the goloshes which he had put on took 
 effect and the watchman at once became the lieutenant there he stood in his room holding a little piece of pink paper between his fingers on which was a poem a poem written by the lieutenant himself who has not had for once in his life a moment of poetic inspiration and at such a moment if the thoughts are written down they flow in poetry the following verses were written on the pink were i rich 
 oh were i rich how oft in bright hour 
 when youthful pleasures banish every care 
 i longed for riches but to gain a power 
 the sword and plume and uniform to wear 
 the riches and the honor came for me 
 yet still my greatest wealth was poverty 
 ah help and pity me 
 once in my youthful hours when gay and free 
 a maiden loved me and her gentle kiss 
 rich in its tender love and purity 
 taught me alas too much of earthly bliss 
 dear child she only thought of youthful glee 
 she loved no wealth but fairy tales and me 
 thou knowest ah pity me 
 oh were i rich again is all my prayer 
 that child is now a woman fair and free 
 as good and beautiful as angels are 
 oh were i rich in lovers poetry 
 to tell my fairy tale richest lore 
 but no i must be silent i am poor 
 ah wilt thou pity me 
 oh were i rich in truth and peace below 
 i need not then my poverty bewail 
 to thee i dedicate these lines of woe 
 wilt thou not understand the mournful tale 
 a leaf on which my sorrows i relate 
 dark story of a darker night of fate 
 ah bless and pity me 
 well yes people write poems when they are in love but a wise 
 man will not print them a lieutenant in love and poor this is a 
 triangle or more properly speaking the half of the broken die of 
 fortune the lieutenant felt this very keenly and therefore leaned 
 his head against the and sighed deeply the poor 
 watchman in the street said he is far happier than i am he 
 knows not what i call poverty he has a home a wife and children who weep at his sorrow and rejoice at his joy oh how much happier i should be could i change my being and position with him and pass 
 through life with his humble expectations and hopes yes he is indeed happier than i am 
 
 at this moment the watchman again became a watchman for having 
 through the goloshes of fortune passed into the existence of the 
 lieutenant and found himself less contented than he expected he 
 had preferred his former condition and wished himself again a 
 watchman that was an ugly dream said he but droll enough it 
 seemed to me as if i were the lieutenant up yonder but there was no 
 happiness for me i missed my wife and the little ones who are always ready to smother me with kisses he sat down again and nodded but he could not get the dream out of his thoughts and he still had the goloshes on his feet a falling star gleamed across the sky there goes one cried he however there are quite enough left i should very much like to examine these a little nearer especially the moon for that could not slip away under hands the student for whom my wife washes says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another if that were true it would be very delightful but i believe it i wish i could make a little spring up there now 
 i would willingly let my body lie here on the steps 
 
 there are certain things in the world which should be uttered very 
 cautiously doubly so when the speaker has on his feet the goloshes of fortune now we shall hear what happened to the watchman 
 nearly every one is acquainted with the great power of steam we 
 have proved it by the rapidity with which we can travel both on a 
 railroad or in a steamship across the sea but this speed is like 
 the movements of the sloth or the crawling march of the snail when 
 compared to the swiftness with which light travels light flies 
 nineteen million times faster than the fleetest and 
 electricity is more rapid still death is an electric shock which we 
 receive in our hearts and on the wings of electricity the liberated 
 soul flies away swiftly the light from the sun travels to our earth 
 millions of miles in eight minutes and a few seconds 
 but on the wings of electricity the mind requires only a second to 
 accomplish the same distance the space between the heavenly bodies is to thought no farther than the distance which we may have to walk from one house to another in the same town yet this electric shock obliges us to use our bodies here below unless like the watchman we have on the goloshes of fortune 
 
 in a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than two 
 hundred thousand miles to the moon which is formed of a lighter 
 material than our earth and may be said to be as soft as new fallen 
 snow he found himself on one of the circular range of mountains which we see represented in dr large map of the moon the interior had the appearance of a large hollow with a depth about half a mile from the brim within this hollow stood a large town we may form some idea of its appearance by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water the materials of which it was built seemed just as soft and pictured forth cloudy turrets and terraces quite transparent and floating in the thin air our earth 
 hung over his head like a great dark red ball presently he discovered 
 a number of beings which might certainly be called men but were very different to ourselves a more fantastical imagination than must have discovered these had they been placed in groups and painted it might have been said what beautiful foliage they had also a language of their own no one could have expected the soul of the watchman to understand it and yet he did understand it for our souls have much greater capabilities then we are inclined to believe do we not in our dreams show a wonderful dramatic talent each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his own character and with his own voice no man could thus imitate them in his waking hours how clearly too we are reminded of persons whom we have not seen for many years they start up suddenly to the eye with all their peculiarities as living realities in fact this memory of the soul is a fearful thing every sin every sinful thought it can bring back and we may well ask how we are to give account of every idle word that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips the spirit of the watchman therefore understood very well the language of the inhabitants of the moon 
 they were disputing about our earth and doubted whether it could be inhabited the atmosphere they asserted must be too dense for any inhabitants of the moon to exist there they maintained that the moon alone was inhabited and was really the heavenly body in which the old world people lived they likewise talked politics 
 
 but now we will descend to east street and see what happened to 
 the body he sat lifeless on the steps his staff had 
 fallen out of his hand and his eyes stared at the moon about which 
 his honest soul was wandering 
 
 what is it watchman inquired a passenger but there 
 was no answer from the watchman 
 
 the man then pulled his nose gently which caused him to lose 
 his balance the body fell forward and lay at full length on the 
 ground as one dead 
 
 all his comrades were very much frightened for he seemed quite 
 dead still they allowed him to remain after they had given notice 
 of what had happened and at dawn the body was carried to the 
 hospital we might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the soul of 
 the man should chance to return to him for most probably it would 
 seek for the body in east street without being able to find it we 
 might fancy the soul inquiring of the police or at the address 
 office or among the missing parcels and then at length finding it at 
 the hospital but we may comfort ourselves by the certainty that the 
 soul when acting upon its own impulses is wiser than we are it is 
 the body that makes it stupid 
 
 as we have said the body had been taken to the 
 hospital and here it was placed in a room to be washed naturally 
 the first thing done here was to take off the goloshes upon which the 
 soul was instantly obliged to return and it took the direct road to 
 the body at once and in a few seconds the life returned to him 
 he declared when he quite recovered himself that this had been the 
 most dreadful night he had ever passed not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again however it was all over now 
 
 the same day he was allowed to leave but the goloshes remained at 
 the hospital 
 
 the eventful moment a most unusual journey 
 every inhabitant of copenhagen knows what the entrance to 
 hospital is like but as most probably a few of those 
 who read this little tale may not reside in copenhagen we will give a 
 short description of it 
 
 the hospital is separated from the street by an iron railing in 
 which the bars stand so wide apart that it is said some very slim 
 patients have squeezed through and gone to pay little visits in the 
 town the most difficult part of the body to get through was the head and in this case as it often happens in the world the small heads were the most fortunate this will serve as sufficient introduction to our tale one of the young volunteers of whom physically speaking it might be said that he had a great head was on guard that evening at the hospital the rain was pouring down yet in spite of these two obstacles he wanted to go out just for a quarter of an hour it was not worth while he thought to make a confidant of the porter as he could easily slip through the iron railings there lay the goloshes which the watchman had forgotten it never occurred to him that these could be goloshes of fortune they would be very 
 serviceable to him in this rainy weather so he drew them on now came the question whether he could squeeze through the palings he 
 certainly had never tried so he stood looking at them i wish to 
 goodness my head was through said he and instantly though it was 
 so thick and large it slipped through quite easily the goloshes 
 answered that purpose very well but his body had to follow and 
 this was impossible i am too fat he said i thought my head would be the worst but i cannot get my body through that is certain then he tried to pull his head back again but without success he could move his neck about easily enough and that was all his first feeling was one of anger and then his spirits sank below zero the goloshes of fortune had placed him in this terrible position and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free no instead of wishing he kept twisting about yet did not stir from the spot the rain poured and not a creature could be seen in the street 
 the bell he was unable to reach and however was he to get loose 
 
 he foresaw that he should have to stay there till morning and then 
 they must send for a smith to file away the iron bars and that 
 would be a work of time all the charity children would just be 
 going to school and all the sailors who inhabited that quarter of the 
 town would be there to see him standing in the pillory what a crowd 
 there would be ha he cried the blood is rushing to my head 
 and i shall go mad i believe i am crazy already oh i wish i were 
 free then all these sensations would pass off this is just what 
 he ought to have said at first the moment he had expressed the 
 thought his head was free he started back quite bewildered with 
 the fright which the goloshes of fortune had caused him but we must not suppose it was all over no indeed there was worse to come yet the night passed and the whole of the following day but no one sent for the goloshes in the evening a declamatory performance was to take place at the amateur theatre in a distant street the house was crowded among the audience was the young volunteer from the hospital who seemed to have quite forgotten his adventures of the previous evening he had on the goloshes they had not been sent for and as the streets were still very dirty they were of great service to him a new poem entitled my spectacles was being recited it described these spectacles as possessing a wonderful power if any one put them on in a large assembly the people appeared like cards and the future events of ensuing years could be easily foretold by them the idea struck him that he should very much like to have such a pair of spectacles for if used rightly 
 they would perhaps enable him to see into the hearts of people 
 which he thought would be more interesting than to know what was going to happen next year for future events would be sure to show 
 themselves but the hearts of people never i can fancy what i should 
 see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the first seat if i 
 could only look into their hearts that lady i imagine keeps a store 
 for things of all descriptions how my eyes would wander about in that collection with many ladies i should no doubt find a large 
 millinery establishment there is another that is perhaps empty and 
 would be all the better for cleaning out there may be some well 
 stored with good articles ah yes he sighed i know one in 
 which everything is solid but a servant is there already and that is 
 the only thing against it i dare say from many i should hear the 
 words please to walk in i only wish i could slip into the hearts 
 like a little tiny thought this was the word of command for the 
 goloshes the volunteer shrunk up together and commenced a most 
 unusual journey through the hearts of the spectators in the first row 
 
 the first heart he entered was that of a lady but he thought he 
 must have got into one of the rooms of an orthopedic institution where plaster casts of deformed limbs were hanging on the walls with this difference that the casts in the institution are formed when the 
 patient enters but here they were formed and preserved after the good people had left these were casts of the bodily and mental deformities of the female friends carefully preserved quickly he passed into another heart which had the appearance of a spacious holy church with the white dove of innocence fluttering over the altar 
 gladly would he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred place but 
 he was carried on to another heart still however listening to the 
 tones of the organ and feeling himself that he had become another and a better man the next heart was also a sanctuary which he felt 
 almost unworthy to enter it represented a mean garret in which lay a 
 sick mother but the warm sunshine streamed through the window lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof two blue birds sang of childlike joys and the sick mother prayed for a blessing on her daughter next he crept on his hands and knees through an overfilled shop there was meat nothing but meat wherever he stepped this was the heart of a rich respectable man whose name is doubtless in the directory then he entered the heart of this wife it was an old the portrait served as a it was connected with all the doors which opened and shut just as the decision turned the next heart was a complete cabinet of mirrors such as can be seen in the castle of rosenberg but these mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree in the middle of the floor sat like the grand lama the insignificant 
 i of the owner astonished at the contemplation of his own features 
 at his next visit he fancied he must have got into a narrow 
 needlecase full of sharp needles oh thought he this must be the 
 heart of an old maid but such was not the fact it belonged to a 
 young officer who wore several orders and was said to be a man of 
 intellect and heart 
 
 the poor volunteer came out of the last heart in the row quite 
 bewildered he could not collect his thoughts and imagined his 
 foolish fancies had carried him away good gracious he sighed i 
 must have a tendency to softening of the brain and here it is so 
 exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head and then 
 suddenly recurred to him the strange event of the evening before when his head had been fixed between the iron railings in front of the 
 hospital that is the cause of it all he exclaimed i must do 
 something in time a russian bath would be a very good thing to 
 begin with i wish i were lying on one of the highest shelves sure 
 enough there he lay on an upper shelf of a vapor bath still in his 
 evening costume with his boots and goloshes on and the hot drops 
 from the ceiling falling on his face ho he cried jumping down and 
 rushing towards the plunging bath the attendant stopped him with a 
 loud cry when he saw a man with all his clothes on the volunteer 
 had however presence of mind enough to whisper it is for a wager but the first thing he did when he reached his own room was to put a large blister on his neck and another on his back that his crazy fit might be cured the next morning his back was very sore which was all he gained by the goloshes of fortune 
 
 the transformation 
 the watchman whom we of course have not forgotten thought after 
 a while of the goloshes which he had found and taken to the hospital 
 so he went and fetched them but neither the lieutenant nor any one in 
 the street could recognize them as their own so he gave them up to 
 the police they look exactly like my own goloshes said one of 
 the clerks examining the unknown articles as they stood by the 
 side of his own it would require even more than the eye of a 
 shoemaker to know one pair from the other 
 
 master clerk said a servant who entered with some papers the 
 clerk turned and spoke to the man but when he had done with him he turned to look at the goloshes again and now he was in greater 
 doubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or on the left 
 belonged to him those that are wet must be mine thought he but he thought wrong it was just the reverse the goloshes of fortune were the wet pair and besides why should not a clerk in a police 
 office be wrong sometimes so he drew them on thrust his papers 
 into his pocket placed a few manuscripts under his arm which he 
 had to take with him and to make abstracts from at home then as 
 it was sunday morning and the weather very fine he said to himself 
 a walk to fredericksburg will do me good so away he went 
 
 there could not be a quieter or more steady young man than this 
 clerk we will not grudge him this little walk it was just the 
 thing to do him good after sitting so much he went on at first like a 
 mere automaton without thought or wish therefore the goloshes had no opportunity to display their magic power in the avenue he met with an acquaintance one of our young poets who told him that he intended to start on the following day on a summer excursion are you really going away so soon asked the clerk what a free happy man you can roam about where you will while such as we are tied by the foot 
 
 but it is fastened to the replied the poet you 
 need have no anxiety for the morrow and when you are old there is a 
 pension for you 
 
 ah yes but you have the best of it said the clerk it must 
 be so delightful to sit and write poetry the whole world makes itself 
 agreeable to you and then you are your own master you should try how you would like to listen to all the trivial things in a court of 
 justice the poet shook his head so also did the clerk each 
 retained his own opinion and so they parted they are strange 
 people these poets thought the clerk i should like to try what it 
 is to have a poetic taste and to become a poet myself i am sure i 
 should not write such mournful verses as they do this is a splendid 
 spring day for a poet the air is so remarkably clear the clouds 
 are so beautiful and the green grass has such a sweet smell for many years i have not felt as i do at this moment 
 
 we perceive by these remarks that he had already become a 
 poet by most poets what he had said would be considered or as the germans call it insipid it is a foolish fancy to look 
 upon poets as different to other men there are many who are more 
 the poets of nature than those who are professed poets the difference is this the intellectual memory is better he seizes upon an idea or a sentiment until he can embody it clearly and plainly in words which the others cannot do but the transition from a character of life to one of a more gifted nature is a great 
 transition and so the clerk became aware of the change after a 
 time what a delightful perfume said he it reminds me of the 
 violets at aunt ah that was when i was a little boy dear me 
 how long it seems since i thought of those days she was a good old 
 maiden lady she lived yonder behind the exchange she always had a sprig or a few blossoms in water let the winter be ever so severe 
 i could smell the violets even while i was placing warm penny 
 pieces against the frozen panes to make and a pretty 
 view it was on which i peeped out in the river lay the ships 
 icebound and forsaken by their crews a screaming crow represented 
 the only living creature on board but when the breezes of spring 
 came everything started into life amidst shouting and cheers the 
 ships were tarred and rigged and then they sailed to foreign lands 
 i remain here and always shall remain sitting at my post at the 
 police office and letting others take passports to distant lands 
 yes this is my fate and he sighed deeply suddenly he paused good gracious what has come over me i never felt before as i do now it must be the air of spring it is overpowering and yet it is 
 delightful 
 
 he felt in his pockets for some of his papers these will give me 
 something else to think of said he casting his eyes on the first 
 page of one he read mistress sigbirth an original tragedy in 
 five acts what is this in my own handwriting too have i 
 written this tragedy he read again the intrigue on the promenade 
 or the a vaudeville however did i get all this some 
 one must have put them into my pocket and here is a letter it was 
 from the manager of a theatre the pieces were rejected not at all in 
 polite terms 
 
 hem hem said he sitting down on a bench his thoughts were 
 very elastic and his heart softened strangely involuntarily he 
 seized one of the nearest flowers it was a little simple daisy 
 all that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in a 
 moment by this little flower it spoke of the glory of its birth it 
 told of the strength of the sunlight which had caused its delicate 
 leaves to expand and given to it such sweet perfume the struggles of life which arouse sensations in the bosom have their type in the 
 tiny flowers air and light are the lovers of the flowers but light 
 is the favored one towards light it turns and only when light 
 vanishes does it fold its leaves together and sleep in the embraces 
 of the air 
 
 it is light that adorns me said the flower 
 
 but the air gives you the breath of life whispered the poet 
 just by him stood a boy splashing with his stick in a marshy 
 ditch the spurted up among the green twigs and the clerk thought of the millions of animalculae which were thrown into the air with every drop of water at a height which must be the same to them as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the clouds as 
 the clerk thought of all these things and became conscious of the 
 great change in his own feelings he smiled and said to himself i 
 must be asleep and dreaming and yet if so how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream i hope i shall be able to remember it all when i wake 
 tomorrow my sensations seem most unaccountable i have a clear 
 perception of everything as if i were wide awake i am quite sure if i 
 recollect all this tomorrow it will appear utterly ridiculous and 
 absurd i have had this happen to me before it is with the clever 
 or wonderful things we say or hear in dreams as with the gold which 
 comes from under the earth it is rich and beautiful when we possess 
 it but when seen in a true light it is but as stones and withered 
 leaves 
 
 ah he sighed mournfully as he gazed at the birds singing 
 merrily or hopping from branch to branch they are much better off 
 than i flying is a glorious power happy is he who is born with 
 wings yes if i could change myself into anything i would be a little 
 lark at the same moment his and sleeves grew together and formed wings his clothes changed to feathers and his goloshes to claws he felt what was taking place and laughed to himself 
 well now it is evident i must be dreaming but i never had such a wild dream as this and then he flew up into the green boughs and sang but thre was no poetry in the song for his poetic nature had left 
 him the goloshes like all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly could only attend to one thing at a time he wished to be a poet and he became one then he wanted to be a little bird and in this change he lost the characteristics of the former one well 
 thought he this is charming by day i sit in a 
 amongst the dryest law papers and at night i can dream that i am a 
 lark flying about in the gardens of fredericksburg really a complete 
 comedy could be written about it then he flew down into the grass 
 turned his head about in every direction and tapped his beak on the 
 bending blades of grass which in proportion to his size seemed to 
 him as long as the in northern africa 
 
 in another moment all was darkness around him it seemed as if 
 something immense had been thrown over him a sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly that he squeaked and then cried out in his alarm you impudent rascal i am a clerk in the but it only sounded to the boy like tweet tweet so he tapped the bird on the beak and walked away with him in the 
 avenue he met two who appeared to belong to a better 
 class of society but whose inferior abilities kept them in the lowest 
 class at school these boys bought the bird for eightpence and so the clerk returned to copenhagen it is well for me that i am 
 dreaming he thought otherwise i should become really angry 
 first i was a poet and now i am a lark it must have been the 
 poetic nature that changed me into this little creature it is a 
 miserable story indeed especially now i have fallen into the hands of 
 boys i wonder what will be the end of it the boys carried him 
 into a very elegant room where a stout lady 
 received them but she was not at all gratified to find that they 
 had brought a lark a common as she called it however she allowed them for one day to place the bird in an empty cage that 
 hung near the window it will please polly perhaps she said 
 laughing at a large gray parrot who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage it is birthday she added 
 in a simpering tone and the little has come to offer 
 his congratulations 
 
 polly did not answer a single word he continued to swing 
 proudly to and fro but a beautiful canary who had been brought 
 from his own warm fragrant fatherland the summer previous began 
 to sing as loud as he could 
 
 you screamer said the lady throwing a white handkerchief 
 over the cage 
 
 tweet tweet sighed he what a dreadful snowstorm and then 
 he became silent 
 
 the clerk or as the lady called him the was placed in 
 a little cage close to the canary and not far from the parrot the 
 only human speech which polly could utter and which she sometimes 
 chattered forth most comically was now let us be men all besides 
 was a scream quite as unintelligible as the warbling of the 
 excepting to the clerk who being now a bird could 
 understand his comrades very well 
 
 i flew beneath green and amidst the blooming 
 sang the canary i flew with my brothers and sisters 
 over beautiful flowers and across the clear bright sea which 
 reflected the waving foliage in its glittering depths and i have seen 
 many gay parrots who could relate long and delightful stories 
 
 they were wild birds answered the parrot and totally 
 uneducated now let us be men why do you not laugh if the lady and her visitors can laugh at this surely you can it is a great 
 failing not to be able to appreciate what is amusing now let us be 
 men 
 
 do you remember said the canary the pretty maidens who used 
 to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms 
 
 do you remember the delicious fruit and the cooling juice from the 
 wild herbs 
 
 oh yes said the parrot but here i am much better off i am 
 well fed and treated politely i know that i have a clever head 
 and what more do i want let us be men now you have a soul for 
 poetry i have deep knowledge and wit you have genius but no 
 discretion you raise your naturally high notes so much that you 
 get covered over they never serve me so oh no i cost them 
 something more than you i keep them in order with my beak and 
 fling my wit about me now let us be men 
 
 o my warm blooming fatherland sang the canary bird i will 
 sing of thy trees and thy quiet streams where the 
 bending branches kiss the clear smooth water i will sing of the 
 joy of my brothers and sisters as their shining plumage flits among 
 the dark leaves of the plants which grow wild by the springs 
 
 do leave off those dismal strains said the parrot sing 
 something to make us laugh laughter is the sign of the highest 
 order of intellect can a dog or a horse laugh no they can cry 
 but to man alone is the power of laughter given ha ha ha 
 laughed polly and repeated his witty saying now let us be men 
 you little gray danish bird said the canary you also have 
 become a prisoner it is certainly cold in your forests but still 
 there is liberty there fly out they have forgotten to close the 
 cage and the window is open at the top fly fly 
 
 instinctively the clerk obeyed and left the cage at the same 
 moment the door leading into the next room creaked on 
 its hinges and stealthily with green fiery eyes the cat crept in 
 and chased the lark round the room the fluttered in his 
 cage and the parrot flapped his wings and cried let us be men the 
 poor clerk in the most deadly terror flew through the window over 
 the houses and through the streets till at length he was obliged 
 to seek a a house opposite to him had a look of home 
 a window stood open he flew in and perched upon the table it was 
 his own room let us be men now said he involuntarily imitating 
 the parrot and at the same moment he became a clerk again only 
 that he was sitting on the table heaven preserve us said he 
 how did i get up here and fall asleep in this way it was an uneasy 
 dream too that i had the whole affair appears most absurd 
 
 the best thing the goloshes did 
 early on the following morning while the clerk was still in 
 bed his neighbor a young divinity student who lodged on the same 
 storey knocked at his door and then walked in lend me your 
 goloshes said he it is so wet in the garden but the sun is 
 shining brightly i should like to go out there and smoke my pipe he 
 put on the goloshes and was soon in the garden which contained 
 only one and one yet in a town even a small 
 garden like this is a great advantage 
 
 the student wandered up and down the path it was just six 
 and he could hear the sound of the in the street 
 oh to travel to travel cried he there is no greater happiness 
 in the world it is the height of my ambition this restless feeling 
 would be stilled if i could take a journey far away from this 
 country i should like to see beautiful switzerland to travel through 
 italy and it was well for him that the goloshes acted immediately 
 otherwise he might have been carried too far for himself as well as 
 for us in a moment he found himself in switzerland closely packed 
 with eight others in the diligence his head ached his back was 
 stiff and the blood had ceased to circulate so that his feet were 
 swelled and pinched by his boots he wavered in a condition between 
 sleeping and waking in his pocket he had a letter of 
 credit in his pocket was his passport and a few louis 
 were sewn into a little leather bag which he carried in his 
 whenever he dozed he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions then he would awake with a start and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his 
 pocket to his breast and from his breast to his 
 pocket to feel whether they were all safe umbrellas 
 sticks and hats swung in the net before him and almost obstructed 
 the prospect which was really very imposing and as he glanced at it 
 his memory recalled the words of one poet at least who has sung of 
 switzerland and whose poems have not yet been printed 
 how lovely to my wondering eyes 
 mont fair summits gently rise 
 tis sweet to breathe the mountain air 
 if you have gold enough to spare 
 grand dark and gloomy appeared the landscape around him the 
 looked like little groups of moss on high rocks whose 
 summits were lost in clouds of mist presently it began to snow and 
 the wind blew keen and cold ah he sighed if i were only on the 
 other side of the alps now it would be summer and i should be able 
 to get money on my letter of credit the anxiety i feel on this matter 
 prevents me from enjoying myself in switzerland oh i wish i was on 
 the other side of the alps 
 
 and there in a moment he found himself far away in the midst of 
 italy between florence and rome where the lake thrasymene 
 glittered in the evening sunlight like a sheet of molten gold 
 between the dark blue mountains there where hannibal defeated 
 flaminius the grape vines clung to each other with the friendly grasp 
 of their green tendril fingers while by the wayside lovely 
 children were watching a herd of swine under the blossoms of fragrant laurel could we rightly describe this 
 picturesque scene our readers would exclaim delightful italy 
 but neither the student nor either of his travelling companions 
 felt the least inclination to think of it in this way poisonous flies 
 and gnats flew into the coach by thousands in vain they drove them 
 away with a myrtle branch the flies stung them notwithstanding there was not a man in the coach whose face was not swollen and disfigured with the stings the poor horses looked wretched the flies settled on their backs in swarms and they were only relieved when the coachmen got down and drove the creatures off 
 
 as the sun set an icy coldness filled all nature not however 
 of long duration it produced the feeling which we experience when 
 we enter a vault at a funeral on a day while the hills 
 and the clouds put on that singular green hue which we often notice in 
 old paintings and look upon as unnatural until we have ourselves seen 
 coloring in the south it was a glorious spectacle but the 
 stomachs of the travellers were empty their bodies exhausted with 
 fatigue and all the longings of their heart turned towards a 
 for the night but where to find one they knew not 
 all the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this to 
 notice the beauties of nature 
 
 the road passed through a grove of it reminded the 
 student of the at home here stood a lonely inn and 
 close by it a number of crippled beggars had placed themselves the 
 brightest among them looked to quote the words of marryat like 
 the eldest son of famine who had just come of age the others were 
 either blind or had withered legs which obliged them to creep 
 about on their hands and knees or they had shrivelled arms and 
 hands without fingers it was indeed poverty arrayed in rags 
 eccellenza miserabili they exclaimed stretching forth their 
 diseased limbs the hostess received the travellers with bare feet 
 untidy hair and a dirty blouse the doors were fastened together with 
 string the floors of the rooms were of brick broken in many 
 places bats flew about under the roof and as to the odor within 
 let us have supper laid in the stable said one of the 
 travellers then we shall know what we are breathing 
 the windows were opened to let in a little fresh air but 
 quicker than air came in the withered arms and the continual whining 
 sounds miserabili eccellenza on the walls were inscriptions 
 half of them against la bella italia 
 
 the supper made its appearance at last it consisted of watery 
 soup seasoned with pepper and rancid oil this last delicacy played a principal part in the salad musty eggs and roasted 
 were the best dishes on the table even the wine had a strange 
 taste it was certainly a mixture at night all the boxes were placed 
 against the doors and one of the travellers watched while the 
 others slept the turn came to watch how close the air felt 
 in that room the heat overpowered him the gnats were buzzing about and stinging while the miserabili outside moaned in their dreams 
 
 travelling would be all very well said the student of 
 divinity to himself if we had no bodies or if the body could rest 
 while the soul if flying wherever i go i feel a want which 
 oppresses my heart for something better presents itself at the 
 moment yes something better which shall be the best of all but 
 where is that to be found in fact i know in my heart very well 
 what i want i wish to attain the greatest of all happiness 
 
 no sooner were the words spoken than he was at home long white 
 curtains shaded the windows of his room and in the middle of the 
 floor stood a black coffin in which he now lay in the still sleep 
 of death his wish was fulfilled his body was at rest and his spirit 
 travelling 
 
 esteem no man happy until he is in his grave were the words 
 of solon here was a strong fresh proof of their truth every corpse 
 is a sphinx of immortality the sphinx in this sarcophagus might 
 unveil its own mystery in the words which the living had himself 
 written two days before 
 stern death thy chilling silence waketh dread 
 yet in thy darkest hour there may be light 
 garden reaper from the cold bed 
 the soul on ladder takes her flight 
 greatest sorrows often are a part 
 of hidden griefs concealed from human eyes 
 which press far heavier on the lonely heart 
 than now the earth that on his coffin lies 
 two figures were moving about the room we know them both one was the fairy named care the other the messenger of fortune they bent over the dead 
 
 look said care what happiness have your goloshes brought to 
 mankind 
 
 they have at least brought lasting happiness to him who 
 slumbers here she said 
 
 not so said care he went away of himself he was not 
 summoned his mental powers were not strong enough to discern the 
 treasures which he had been destined to discover i will do him a 
 favor now and she drew the goloshes from his feet 
 
 the sleep of death was ended and the recovered man raised 
 himself care vanished and with her the goloshes doubtless she 
 looked upon them as her own property 
 
 the end

 we are gathered here this week to nominate a candidate and adopt a platform which will expand unify direct and inspire our party and the nation to fulfill this mission my constituency is the desperate the damned the disinherited the disrespected and the despised they are restless and seek relief they have voted in record numbers they have invested the faith hope and trust that they have in us the democratic party must send them a signal that we care i pledge my best not to let them down 
 there is the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity leadership must heed the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity for they are the key to achieving our mission time is neutral and does not change things with courage and initiative leaders change things 
 no generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born an age of enlightenment an age of jobs and peace and justice only leadership that intangible combination of gifts the discipline information circumstance courage timing will and divine inspiration can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation leadership can part the waters and lead our nation in the direction of the promised land leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom 
 i have had the rare opportunity to watch seven men and then two pour out their souls offer their service and heal and heed the call of duty to direct the course of our nation there is a proper season for everything there is a time to sow and a time to reap a time to compete and a time to cooperate 
 i ask for your vote on the first ballot as a vote for a new direction for this party and this nation a vote of conviction a vote of conscience but i will be proud to support the nominee of this convention for the presidency of the united states of america thank you 
 i have watched the leadership of our party develop and grow my respect for both mr mondale and mr hart is great i have watched them struggle with the crosswinds and crossfires of being public servants and i believe they will both continue to try to serve us faithfully 
 i am elated by the knowledge that for the first time in our history a woman geraldine ferraro will be recommended to share our ticket 
 throughout this campaign tried to offer leadership to the democratic party and the nation if in my high moments i have done some good offered some service shed some light healed some wounds rekindled some hope or stirred someone from apathy and indifference or in any way along the way helped somebody then this campaign has not been in vain 
 for friends who loved and cared for me and for a god who spared me and for a family who understood i am eternally grateful 
 if in my low moments in word deed or attitude through some error of temper taste or tone i have caused anyone discomfort created pain or revived fears that was not my truest self if there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance please forgive me charge it to my head and not to my heart my head so limited in its finitude my heart which is boundless in its love for the human family i am not a perfect servant i am a public servant doing my best against the odds as i develop and serve be patient god is not finished with me yet 
 this campaign has taught me much that leaders must be tough enough to fight tender enough to cry human enough to make mistakes humble enough to admit them strong enough to absorb the pain and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving 
 for leaders the pain is often intense but you must smile through your tears and keep moving with the faith that there is a brighter side somewhere 
 i went to see hubert humphrey three days before he died he had just called richard nixon from his dying bed and many people wondered why and i asked him he said jesse from this vantage point the sun is setting in my life all of the speeches the political conventions the crowds and the great fights are behind me now at a time like this you are forced to deal with your irreducible essence forced to grapple with that which is really important to you and what concluded about life hubert humphrey said when all is said and done we must forgive each other and redeem each other and move on 
 our party is emerging from one of its most hard fought battles for the democratic presidential nomination in our history but our healthy competition should make us better not bitter we must use the insight wisdom and experience of the late hubert humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our party this nation and the world we must forgive each other redeem each other regroup and move one our flag is red white and blue but our nation is a rainbow red yellow brown black and white and all precious in sight 
 america is not like a blanket one piece of unbroken cloth the same color the same texture the same size america is more like a quilt many patches many pieces many colors many sizes all woven and held together by a common thread the white the hispanic the black the arab the jew the woman the native american the small farmer the businessperson the environmentalist the peace activist the young the old the lesbian the gay and the disabled make up the american quilt 
 even in our fractured state all of us count and fit somewhere we have proven that we can survive without each other but we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other we must come together 
 from fannie lou hamer in atlantic city in to the rainbow coalition in san francisco today from the atlantic to the pacific we have experienced pain but progress as we ended american apartheid laws we got public accommodations we secured voting rights we obtained open housing as young people got the right to vote we lost malcolm martin medgar bobby john and viola the team that got us here must be expanded not abandoned 
 twenty years ago tears welled up in our eyes as the bodies of schwerner goodman and chaney were dredged from the depths of a river in mississippi twenty years later our communities black and jewish are in anguish anger and pain feelings have been hurt on both sides there is a crisis in communications confusion is in the air but we cannot afford to lose our way we may agree to agree or agree to disagree on issues we must bring back civility to these tensions 
 we are in a long and rich religious history the traditions many blacks and jews have a shared passion for social justice at home and peace abroad we must seek a revival of the spirit inspired by a new vision and new possibilities we must return to higher ground we are bound by moses and jesus but also connected with islam and mohammed these three great religions judaism christianity and islam were all born in the revered and holy city of jerusalem 
 we are bound by dr martin luther king jr and rabbi abraham heschel crying out from their graves for us to reach common ground we are bound by shared blood and shared sacrifices we are much too intelligent much too bound by our heritage much too victimized by racism sexism militarism and much too threatened as historical scapegoats to go on divided one from another we must turn from finger pointing to clasped hands we must share our burdens and our joys with each other once again we must turn to each other and not on each other and choose higher ground 
 twenty years later we cannot be satisfied by just restoring the old coalition old wine skins must make room for new wine we must heal and expand the rainbow coalition is making room for arab americans they too know the pain and hurt of racial and religious rejection they must not continue to be made pariahs the rainbow coalition is making room for hispanic americans who this very night are living under the threat of the bill and farm workers from ohio who are fighting the campbell soup company with a boycott to achieve legitimate workers rights 
 the rainbow is making room for the native american the most exploited people of all a people with the greatest moral claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of their ancient land and claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of land and water rights as they seek to preserve their ancestral homeland and the beauty of a land that was once all theirs they can never receive a fair share for all they have given us they must finally have a fair chance to develop their great resources and to preserve their people and their culture 
 the rainbow coalition includes asian americans now being killed in our streets scapegoats for the failures of corporate industrial and economic policies 
 the rainbow is making room for the young americans twenty years ago our young people were dying in a war for which they could not even vote twenty years later young america has the power to stop a war in central america and the responsibility to vote in great numbers young america must be politically active in the choice is war or peace we must make room for young america 
 the rainbow includes disabled veterans the color scheme fits in the rainbow the disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed while the have their genius revealed and their disability concealed but ultimately we must judge people by their values and their contribution leave anybody out i would rather have roosevelt in a wheelchair than reagan on a horse 
 the rainbow is making room for small farmers they have suffered tremendously under the reagan regime they will either receive percent parity or percent charity we must address their concerns and make room for them the rainbow includes lesbians and gays no american citizen ought be denied equal protection from the law 
 we must be unusually committed and caring as we expand our family to include new members all of us must be tolerant and understanding as the fears and anxieties of the rejected and the party leadership express themselves in many different ways too often what we call hate as if it were some philosophy or strategy is simply ignorance anxiety paranoia fear and insecurity to be strong leaders we must be as we seek to right the wrongs of our party and our nation we must expand our party heal our party and unify our party that is our mission in 
 we are often reminded that we live in a great nation and we do but it can be greater still the rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness we must not measure greatness from the mansion down but the manger up jesus said that we should not be judged by the bark we wear but by the fruit that we bear jesus said that we must measure greatness by how we treat the least of these 
 president reagan says the nation is in recovery those corporations that made a profit last year but paid no federal taxes are recovering the military contractors who have benefited from more than doubling of the military budget in peacetime surely they are recovering the big corporations and rich individuals who received the bulk of a multibillion tax cut from mr reagan are recovering but no such recovery is under way for the least of these 
 rising tides lift all boats particularly those stuck at the bottom for the boats stuck at the bottom a misery index this administration has made life more miserable for the poor its attitude has been contemptuous its policies and programs have been cruel and unfair to working people they must be held accountable in november for increasing infant mortality among the poor in detroit one of the great cities of the western world babies are dying at the same rate as honduras the most underdeveloped nation in our hemisphere this administration must be held accountable for policies that have contributed to the growing poverty in america there are now million people in poverty percent of our nation million are white million black hispanic asian and others mostly women and children by the end of this year there will be million people in poverty we cannot stand idly by we must fight for a change now 
 under this regime we look at social security the budget cuts included nine permanent social security benefit cuts totaling billion over five years small businesses have suffered under reagan tax cuts only percent of total business tax cuts went to them percent to big businesses health care under mr reagan has already been sharply cut education under mr reagan has been cut percent under mr reagan there are now million female head families they represent percent of all families half of all of them are poor percent of all poor children live in a house headed by a woman where there is no man under mr reagan the administration has cleaned up only of priority toxic waste dumps farmers real net income was only about half its level in 
 many say that the race in november will be decided in the south president reagan is depending on the conservative south to return him to office but the south i tell you is unnaturally conservative the south is the poorest region in our nation and therefore has the least to conserve in his appeal to the south mr reagan is trying to substitute flags and prayer cloths for food and clothing and education health care and housing 
 mr reagan will ask us to pray and i believe in prayer i have come to this way by the power of prayer but then we must watch false prophecy he cuts energy assistance to the poor cuts breakfast programs from children cuts lunch programs from children cuts job training from children and then says to an empty table let us pray apparently he is not familiar with the structure of a prayer you thank the lord for the food that you are about to receive not the food that just left i think that we should pray but pray for the food that left pray for the man that took the food to leave we need a change we need a change in november 
 under mr reagan the misery index has risen for the poor the danger index has risen for everybody under this administration lost the lives of our boys in central america and honduras in grenada in lebanon in nuclear standoff in europe under this administration of our children believe they will die in a nuclear war the danger index is increasing in this world all the talk about the defense against russia the russian submarines are closer and their missiles are more accurate we live in a world tonight more miserable and a world more dangerous 
 while reaganomics and reaganism is talked about often so often we miss the real meaning reaganism is a spirit and reaganomics represents the real economic facts of life in mr george bush a man with reasonable access to mr reagan did an analysis of mr economic plan mr george bush concluded that plan was voodoo economics he was right candidate john anderson said a combination of military spending tax cuts and a balanced budget by would be accomplished with blue smoke and mirrors they were both right 
 mr reagan talks about a dynamic recovery some measure of recovery three and a half years later unemployment has inched just below where it was when he took office in there are still million people officially unemployed million working only inflation has come down but analyze for a moment who has paid the price for this superficial economic recovery 
 mr reagan curbed inflation by cutting consumer demand he cut consumer demand with conscious and callous fiscal and monetary policies he used the federal budget to deliberately induce unemployment and curb social spending he then weighed and supported tight monetary policies of the federal reserve board to deliberately drive up interest rates again to curb consumer demand created through borrowing unemployment reached percent we experienced skyrocketing interest rates our dollar inflated abroad there were record bank failures record farm foreclosures record business bankruptcies record budget deficits record trade deficits 
 mr reagan brought inflation down by destabilizing our economy and disrupting family life he promised he promised in a balanced budget but instead we now have a record billion dollar budget deficit under mr reagan the cumulative budget deficit for his four years is more than the sum total of deficits from george washington to jimmy carter combined i tell you we need a change 
 how is he paying for these jobs economic recovery is being financed by deficit spending billion dollars a year military spending a major cause of this deficit is projected over the next five years to be nearly trillion dollars and will cost about dollars for every taxpaying family when the government borrows billion dollars annually to finance the deficit this encourages the private sector to make its money off of interest rates as opposed to development and economic growth 
 even money abroad we have enough money domestically to finance the debt so we are now borrowing money abroad from foreign banks governments and financial institutions billion dollars in billion dollars in percent of our total over billion dollars percent of our total in by it is projected that percent of all individual income taxes will be going just to pay for interest on that debt the united states used to be the largest exporter of capital but under mr reagan we will quite likely become the largest debtor nation 
 about two weeks ago on july the th we celebrated our declaration of independence yet every day economics is making our nation more economically dependent and less economically free five to six percent of our gross national product is now being eaten up with president budget deficits to depend on foreign military powers to protect our national security would be foolish making us dependent and less secure yet reaganomics has us increasingly dependent on foreign economic sources this but recovery is unbalanced and artificial we have a challenge as democrats to point a way out 
 democracy guarantees opportunity not success 
 democracy guarantees the right to participate not a license for either a majority or a minority to dominate 
 the victory for the rainbow coalition in the platform debates today was not whether we won or lost but that we raised the right issues we could afford to lose the vote issues are we could not afford to avoid raising the right questions our and our moral integrity were at stake our heads are perhaps bloody but not bowed our back is straight we can go home and face our people our vision is clear 
 when we think on this journey from to championship that we have gone from the planks of the boardwalk in atlantic city in to fighting to help write the planks in the platform in san francisco in there is a deep and abiding sense of joy in our souls in spite of the tears in our eyes though there are missing planks there is a solid foundation upon which to build our party can win but we must provide hope which will inspire people to struggle and achieve provide a plan that shows a way out of our dilemma and then lead the way 
 in my heart is made to feel glad because i know there is a way out justice the requirement for rebuilding america is justice the linchpin of progressive politics in our nation will not come from the north they in fact will come from the south that is why i argue over and over again we look from virginia around to texas only one black congressperson out of nineteen years later locked out of the congress the senate and the mansion what does this large black vote mean why do i fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and elections why do we fight over that because i tell you you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them unless you linger there 
 if you want a change in this nation you enforce that voting rights act get to black hispanics female and progressive congresspersons from the south we can save the cotton but got to fight the boll weevils got to make a judgment got to make a judgment 
 it is not enough to hope era will pass how can we pass era if blacks vote in great numbers progressive whites win the only way progressive whites win if blacks vote in great numbers hispanics win when blacks hispanics and progressive whites vote women win when women win children win when women and children win workers win we must all come up together we must come up together 
 thank you 
 for all of our joy and excitement we must not save the world and lose our souls we should never enforcing the voting rights act at every level when one of us all of us will rise justice is the way out peace is the way out we should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable 
 in this world in which we live we dropped the bomb on japan and felt guilty but in other folks have also got bombs this time if we drop the bomb six minutes later we too will be destroyed not about dropping the bomb on somebody it is about dropping the bomb on everybody we must choose to develop minds over guided missiles and think it out and not fight it out time for a change 
 our foreign policy must be characterized by mutual respect not by gunboat diplomacy big stick diplomacy and threats our nation at its best feeds the hungry our nation at its worst at its worst will mine the harbors of nicaragua at its worst will try to overthrow their government at its worst will cut aid to american education and increase the aid to el salvador at its worst our nation will have partnerships with south africa a moral disgrace a moral disgrace a moral disgrace 
 we look at africa we cannot just focus on apartheid in southern africa we must fight for trade with africa and not just aid to africa we cannot stand idly by and say we will not relate to nicaragua unless they have elections there and then embrace military regimes in africa overthrowing democratic governments in nigeria and liberia and ghana we must fight for democracy all around the world and play the game by one set of rules 
 peace in this world our present formula for peace in the middle east is inadequate it will not work there are nations in the middle east our nation must be able to talk and act and influence all of them we must build upon camp david and measure human rights by one yard stick in that region we have too many interests and too few friends 
 there is a way out jobs put america back to work when i was a child growing up in greenville south carolina the reverend sample used to preach every so often a sermon relating to jesus and he said if i be lifted up draw all men unto me i quite understand what he meant as a child growing up but i understand a little better now if you raise up truth magnetic it has a way of drawing people 
 with all this confusion in this convention the bright lights and parties and big fun we must raise up the simple proposition if we lift up a program to feed the hungry come running if we lift up a program to study war no more our youth will come running if we lift up a program to put america back to work and an alternative to welfare and despair they will come working 
 if we cut that military budget without cutting our defense and use that money to rebuild bridges and put steel workers back to work and use that money and provide jobs for our cities and use that money to build schools and pay teachers and educate our children and build hospitals and train doctors and train nurses the whole nation will come running to us 
 as i leave you now we vote in this convention and get ready to go back across this nation in a couple of days in this campaign tried to be faithful to my promise i lived in old barrios ghettos and reservations and housing projects i have a message for our youth i challenge them to put hope in their brains and not dope in their veins i told them that like jesus i too was born in the slum but just because born in the slum does not mean the slum is born in you and you can rise above it if your mind is made up i told them in every slum there are two sides when i see a broken window the slummy side train some youth to become a glazier the sunny side when i see a missing brick the slummy side let that child in the union and become a brick mason and build the sunny side when i see a missing door the slummy side train some youth to become a carpenter the sunny side and when i see the vulgar words and hieroglyphics of destitution on the walls the slummy side train some youth to become a painter an artist the sunny side 
 we leave this place looking for the sunny side because a brighter side somewhere more convinced than ever that we can win we will vault up the rough side of the mountain we can win i just want young america to do me one favor just one favor exercise the right to dream you must face reality that which is but then dream of a reality that ought to be that must be live beyond the pain of reality with the dream of a bright tomorrow use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress use love to motivate you and obligate you to serve the human family 
 young america dream choose the human race over the nuclear race bury the weapons and burn the people dream dream of a new value system teachers who teach for life and not just for a living teach because they help it dream of lawyers more concerned about justice than a judgeship dream of doctors more concerned about public health than personal wealth dream of preachers and priests who will prophesy and not just profiteer preach and dream 
 our time has come our time has come suffering breeds character character breeds faith in the end faith will not disappoint our time has come our faith hope and dreams will prevail our time has come weeping has endured for nights but now joy cometh in the morning our time has come no grave can hold our body down our time has come no lie can live forever our time has come we must leave racial battle ground and come to economic common ground and moral higher ground america our time has come we come from disgrace to amazing grace our time has come give me your tired give me your poor your huddled masses who yearn to breathe free and come november there will be a change because our time has come 
 
 statement on the articles of impeachment 
 barbara jordan 
 delivered july house judiciary committee 
 mr chairman i join my colleague mr rangel in thanking you for giving the junior members of this committee the glorious opportunity of sharing the pain of this inquiry mr chairman you are a strong man and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as much assistance as possible 
 earlier today we heard the beginning of the preamble to the constitution of the united states we the people a very eloquent beginning but when that document was completed on the seventeenth of september in i was not included in that we the people i felt somehow for many years that george washington and alexander hamilton just left me out by mistake but through the process of amendment interpretation and court decision i have finally been included in we the people 
 today i am an inquisitor an hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that i feel right now my faith in the constitution is whole it is complete it is total and i am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the subversion the destruction of the constitution 
 who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves federalist no the subject of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men that is what we are talking about in other words the jurisdiction comes from the abuse of violation of some public trust it is wrong i suggest it is a misreading of the constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced that the president should be removed from office the constitution say that the powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the legislature against and upon the encroachments of the executive the division between the two branches of the legislature the house and the senate assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other the right to judge the framers of this constitution were very astute they did not make the accusers and the judges the same person 
 we know the nature of impeachment we have been talking about it awhile now it is chiefly designed for the president and his high ministers to somehow be called into account it is designed to bridle the executive if he engages in excesses it is designed as a method of national inquest into the public men the framers confined in the congress the power if need be to remove the president in order to strike a delicate balance between a president swollen with power and grown tyrannical and preservation of the independence of the executive the nature of impeachment is a narrowly channeled exception to the maxim the federal convention of said that 
 the framers limited impeachment to high crimes and misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term maladministration it is to be used only for great misdemeanors so it was said in the north carolina ratification convention and in the virginia ratification convention we do not trust our liberty to a particular branch we need one branch to check the others 
 the north carolina ratification convention no one need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity prosecutions of impeachments will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community said hamilton in the federalist papers no and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused i do not mean political parties in that sense 
 the drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment but impeachment must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term high crimes and misdemeanors of the impeachment process it was woodrow wilson who said that nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed and effectiveness indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction but nothing else can 
 common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons congress has a lot to do appropriation tax reform health insurance campaign finance reform housing environmental protection energy sufficiency mass transportation pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems so today we are not being petty we are trying to be big because the task we have before us is a big one 
 this morning in a discussion of the evidence we were told that the evidence which purports to support the allegations of misuse of the cia by the president is thin we are told that that evidence is insufficient what that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what the president did know on june the rd 
 the president did know that it was republican money that it was money from the committee for the of the president which was found in the possession of one of the burglars arrested on june the th what the president did know on the rd of june was the prior activities of e howard hunt which included his participation in the of daniel psychiatrist which included howard participation in the dita beard itt affair which included howard fabrication of cables designed to discredit the kennedy administration 
 we were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the president of the united states there has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any additional materials from the president the committee subpoena is outstanding and if the president wants to supply that material the committee sits here the fact is that on yesterday the american people waited with great anxiety for eight hours not knowing whether their president would obey an order of the supreme court of the united states 
 at this point i would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of actions the president has engaged in impeachment criteria james madison from the virginia ratification convention if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him he may be impeached 
 we have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants of money the president had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds collected for the presidential campaign we know that the president met with mr henry petersen times to discuss matters related to watergate and immediately thereafter met with the very persons who were implicated in the information mr petersen was receiving and transmitting to the president the words are if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person he may be impeached 
 justice story impeachment is intended for occasional and extraordinary cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their rights and rescue their liberties from violations 
 we know about the huston plan we know about the of the office we know that there was absolute complete direction in august when the president instructed ehrlichman to do whatever is necessary this instruction led to a surreptitious entry into dr office 
 protect their rights rescue their liberties from violation 
 the south carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria those are impeachable who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 beginning shortly after the watergate and continuing to the present time the president has engaged in a series of public statements and actions designed to thwart the lawful investigation by government prosecutors moreover the president has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the watergate case which the evidence will show he knew to be false these assertions false assertions impeachable those who misbehave those who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 james madison again at the constitutional convention a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 the constitution charges the president with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed and yet the president has counseled his aides to commit perjury willfully disregarded the secrecy of grand jury proceedings concealed surreptitious entry attempted to compromise a federal judge while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice 
 a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 if the impeachment provision in the constitution of the united states will not reach the offenses charged here then perhaps that th century constitution should be abandoned to a th century paper shredder 
 has the president committed offenses and planned and directed and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the constitution will not tolerate the question we know that we know the question we should now forthwith proceed to answer the question it is reason and not passion which must guide our deliberations guide our debate and guide our decision 
 
 farewell address to congress 
 general douglas macarthur 
 delivered april 
 mr president mr speaker and distinguished members of the congress 
 i stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride humility in the weight of those great american architects of our history who have stood here before me pride in the reflection that this home of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet devised here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race i do not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration they must be resolved on the highest plane of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected i trust therefore that you will do me the justice of receiving that which i have to say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow american 
 i address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life with but one purpose in mind to serve my country the issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector oblivious to those of another is but to court disaster for the whole while asia is commonly referred to as the gateway to europe it is no less true that europe is the gateway to asia and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other there are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts that we cannot divide our effort i can think of no greater expression of defeatism if a potential enemy can divide his strength on two fronts it is for us to counter his effort the communist threat is a global one its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every other sector you can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in asia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in europe 
 beyond pointing out these general truisms i shall confine my discussion to the general areas of asia before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there he must comprehend something of past and the revolutionary changes which have marked her course up to the present long exploited by the colonial powers with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice individual dignity or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the philippines the peoples of asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity a heretofore unfelt dignity and the of political freedom 
 mustering half of the population and percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force both moral and material with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not this is the direction of asian progress and it may not be stopped it is a corollary to the shift of the world economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area whence it started 
 in this situation it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era is now past and the asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny what they seek now is friendly guidance understanding and support not imperious direction the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation their standard of life pitifully low is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in wake world ideologies play little part in asian thinking and are little understood what the peoples strive for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs a little better clothing on their backs a little firmer roof over their heads and the realization of the normal nationalist urge for political freedom these conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism 
 of more direct and immediately bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the pacific ocean in the course of the past war prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the united states lay on the literal line of the americas with an exposed island salient extending out through hawaii midway and guam to the philippines that salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack 
 the pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas all this was changed by our pacific victory our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire pacific ocean which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we held it indeed it acts as a protective shield for all of the americas and all free lands of the pacific ocean area we control it to the shores of asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the aleutians to the mariannas held by us and our free allies from this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every asiatic port from vladivostok to singapore with sea and air power every port as i said from vladivostok to singapore and prevent any hostile movement into the pacific 
 any predatory attack from asia must be an amphibious effort no amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance with naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases any major attack from continental asia toward us or our friends in the pacific would be doomed to failure 
 under such conditions the pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader it assumes instead the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense it envisions no attack against anyone nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations but properly maintained would be an invincible defense against aggression the holding of this literal defense line in the western pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment 
 this is a military estimate as to which i have yet to find a military leader who will take exception for that reason i have strongly recommended in the past as a matter of military urgency that under no circumstances must formosa fall under communist control such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the philippines and the loss of japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of california oregon and washington 
 to understand the changes which now appear upon the chinese mainland one must understand the changes in chinese character and culture over the past years china up to years ago was completely being compartmented into groups divided against each other the tendency was almost as they still followed the tenets of the confucian ideal of pacifist culture at the turn of the century under the regime of chang tso lin efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge this was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of chiang but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant aggressive tendencies 
 through these past years the chinese people have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals they now constitute excellent soldiers with competent staffs and commanders this has produced a new and dominant power in asia which for its own purposes is allied with soviet russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become aggressively imperialistic with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of imperialism 
 there is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the chinese the standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war that the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies 
 i have from the beginning believed that the chinese communists support of the north koreans was the dominant one their interests are at present parallel with those of the soviet but i believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in korea but also in and tibet and pointing potentially toward the south reflects predominantly the same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every conqueror since the beginning of time 
 the japanese people since the war have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history with a commendable will eagerness to learn and marked capacity to understand they have from the ashes left in wake erected in japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality freedom of economic enterprise and social justice 
 politically economically and socially japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust that it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficial influence over the course of events in asia is attested by the magnificent manner in which the japanese people have met the recent challenge of war confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress i sent all four of our occupation divisions to the korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon japan the results fully justified my faith i know of no nation more serene orderly and industrious nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race 
 of our former ward the philippines we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of terrible destructiveness we must be patient and understanding and never fail them as in our hour of need they did not fail us a christian nation the philippines stand as a mighty bulwark of christianity in the far east and its capacity for high moral leadership in asia is unlimited 
 on formosa the government of the republic of china has had the opportunity to refute by action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the chinese mainland the formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration with majority representation on the organs of government and politically economically and socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines 
 with this brief insight into the surrounding areas i now turn to the korean conflict while i was not consulted prior to the decision to intervene in support of the republic of korea that decision from a military standpoint proved a sound one as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces our victory was complete and our objectives within reach when red china intervened with numerically superior ground forces 
 this created a new war and an entirely new situation a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed against the north korean invaders a situation which called for new decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy 
 such decisions have not been forthcoming 
 while no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental china and such was never given a thought the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old 
 apart from the military need as i saw it to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the yalu i felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary first the intensification of our economic blockade against china two the imposition of a naval blockade against the china coast three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of coastal areas and of manchuria four removal of restrictions on the forces of the republic of china on formosa with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy 
 for entertaining these views all professionally designed to support our forces committed to korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless american and allied lives i have been severely criticized in lay circles principally abroad despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the korean campaign including our own joint chiefs of staff 
 i called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available i made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy bases north of the yalu if not permitted to utilize the friendly chinese force of some men on formosa if not permitted to blockade the china coast to prevent the chinese reds from getting succor from without and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory 
 we could hold in korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential i have constantly called for the new political decisions essential to a solution 
 efforts have been made to distort my position it has been said in effect that i was a warmonger nothing could be further from the truth i know war as few other men now living know it and nothing to me is more revolting i have long advocated its complete abolition as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes indeed on the second day of september nineteen hundred and just following the surrender of the japanese nation on the battleship missouri i formally cautioned as follows 
 men since the beginning of time have sought peace various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations from the very start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never been successful military alliances balances of power leagues of nations all in turn failed leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war the utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative we have had our last chance if we will not devise some greater and more equitable system armageddon will be at our door the problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science art literature and all material and cultural developments of the past years it must be of the spirit 
 if we are to save the flesh 
 but once war is forced upon us there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end 
 very object is victory not prolonged indecision 
 in war there is no substitute for victory 
 there are some who for varying reasons would appease red china they are blind to clear lesson for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war it points to no single instance where this end has justified that means where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace like blackmail it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until as in blackmail violence becomes the only other alternative 
 why my soldiers asked of me surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field i could not answer 
 some may say to avoid spread of the conflict into an war with china others to avoid soviet intervention neither explanation seems valid for china is already engaging with the maximum power it can commit and the soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves like a cobra any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a basis 
 the tragedy of korea is further heightened by the fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits it condemns that nation which it is our purpose to save to suffer the devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the sanctuaries are fully protected from such attack and devastation 
 of the nations of the world korea alone up to now is the sole one which has risked its all against communism the magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the korean people defies description 
 they have chosen to risk death rather than slavery their last words to me were scuttle the pacific 
 i have just left your fighting sons in korea they have met all tests there and i can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way 
 it was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety 
 those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always 
 i am closing my years of military service when i joined the army even before the turn of the century it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams the world has turned over many times since i took the oath on the plain at west point and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished but i still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die they just fade away 
 and like the old soldier of that ballad i now close my military career and just fade away an old soldier who tried to do his duty as god gave him the light to see that duty 
 good bye 
 
 been to the mountaintop 
 martin luther king jr 
 delivered april in memphis tennessee 
 thank you very kindly my friends as i listened to ralph abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself i wondered who he was talking about always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you and ralph abernathy is the best friend that i have in the world delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning you reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow 
 something is happening in memphis something is happening in our world and you know if i were standing at the beginning of time with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now and the almighty said to me martin luther king which age would you like to live in i would take my mental flight by egypt and i would watch children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of egypt through or rather across the red sea through the wilderness on toward the promised land and in spite of its magnificence i stop there 
 i would move on by greece and take my mind to mount olympus and i would see plato aristotle socrates euripides and aristophanes assembled around the parthenon and i would watch them around the parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality but i stop there 
 i would go on even to the great heyday of the roman empire and i would see developments around there through various emperors and leaders but i stop there i would even come up to the day of the renaissance and get a quick picture of all that the renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man but i stop there i would even go by the way that the man for whom named had his habitat and i would watch martin luther as he tacked his theses on the door at the church in wittenberg but i stop there 
 i would come on up even to and watch a vacillating president by the name of abraham lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the emancipation proclamation but i stop there 
 i would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation and come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but fear itself but i stop there 
 strangely enough i would turn to the almighty and say if you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the th century i will be happy 
 now a strange statement to make because the world is all messed up the nation is sick trouble is in the land confusion all around a strange statement but i know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars and i see god working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men in some strange way are responding something is happening in our world 
 the masses of people are rising up and wherever they are assembled today whether they are in johannesburg south africa nairobi kenya accra ghana new york city atlanta georgia jackson mississippi or memphis tennessee the cry is always the same we want to be free 
 and another reason that happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history but the demands force them to do it survival demands that we grapple with them men for years now have been talking about war and peace but now no longer can they just talk about it it is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world nonviolence or nonexistence that is where we are today 
 and also in the human rights revolution if something done and done in a hurry to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty their long years of hurt and neglect the whole world is doomed now just happy that god has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding and happy that allowed me to be in memphis 
 i can remember i can remember when negroes were just going around as ralph has said so often scratching where they itch and laughing when they were not tickled but that day is all over we mean business now and we are determined to gain our rightful place in world 
 and all this whole thing is about we engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody we are saying that we are determined to be men we are determined to be people we are saying that we are children and that we have to live like we are forced to live 
 now what does all of this mean in this great period of history it means that got to stay together got to stay together and maintain unity you know whenever pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in egypt he had a favorite favorite formula for doing it what was that he kept the slaves fighting among themselves but whenever the slaves get together something happens in court and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery when the slaves get together the beginning of getting out of slavery now let us maintain unity 
 secondly let us keep the issues where they are the issue is injustice the issue is the refusal of memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants who happen to be sanitation workers now got to keep attention on that always the problem with a little violence you know what happened the other day and the press dealt only with the i read the articles they very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand three hundred sanitation workers were on strike and that memphis is not being fair to them and that mayor loeb is in dire need of a doctor they get around to that 
 now going to march again and got to march again in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of children here suffering sometimes going hungry going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out the issue and got to say to the nation we know coming out for when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it there is no stopping point short of victory 
 we going to let any mace stop us we are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces they know what to do seen them so often i remember in birmingham alabama when we were in that majestic struggle there we would move out of the th street baptist church day after day by the hundreds we would move out and bull connor would tell them to send the dogs forth and they did come but we just went before the dogs singing gonna let nobody turn me around bull connor next would say turn the fire hoses on and as i said to you the other night bull connor know history he knew a kind of physics that somehow relate to the transphysics that we knew about and that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out and we went before the fire hoses we had known water if we were baptist or some other denomination we had been immersed if we were methodist and some others we had been sprinkled but we knew water 
 that stop us and we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them and go on before the water hoses and we would look at it and just go on singing over my head i see freedom in the air and then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can and they would throw us in and old bull would say take them off and they did and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing we shall overcome and every now and then get in the jail and see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers and being moved by our words and our songs and there was a power there which bull connor adjust to and so we ended up transforming bull into a steer and we won our struggle in birmingham 
 now got to go on to memphis just like that i call upon you to be with us monday now about injunctions we have an injunction and going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal unconstitutional injunction all we say to america is be true to what you said on paper if i lived in china or even russia or any totalitarian country maybe i could understand the denial of certain basic first amendment privileges because they committed themselves to that over there but somewhere i read of the freedom of assembly somewhere i read of the freedom of speech somewhere i read of the freedom of the press somewhere i read that the greatness of america is the right to protest for right and so just as i say we going to let any injunction turn us around we are going on 
 we need all of you and you know beautiful tome is to see all of these ministers of the gospel a marvelous picture who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher somehow the preacher must be an amos and say let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream somehow the preacher must say with jesus the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor 
 and i want to commend the preachers under the leadership of these noble men james lawson one who has been in this struggle for many years been to jail for struggling but still going on fighting for the rights of his people rev ralph jackson billy kiles i could just go right on down the list but time will not permit but i want to thank them all and i want you to thank them because so often preachers concerned about anything but themselves and always happy to see a relevant ministry 
 all right to talk about long white robes over yonder in all of its symbolism but ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here all right to talk about streets flowing with milk and honey but god has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here and his children who eat three square meals a day all right to talk about the new jerusalem but one day preachers must talk about the new york the new atlanta the new philadelphia the new los angeles the new memphis tennessee this is what we have to do 
 now the other thing have to do is this always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal now we are poor people individually we are poor when you compare us with white society in america we are poor never stop and forget that collectively that means all of us together collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world with the exception of nine did you ever think about that after you leave the united states soviet russia great britain west germany france and i could name the others the negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world we have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year which is more than all of the exports of the united states and more than the national budget of canada did you know that power right there if we know how to pool it 
 we have to argue with anybody we have to curse and go around acting bad with our words we need any bricks and bottles we need any molotov cocktails we just need to go around to these stores and to these massive industries in our country and say god sent us by here to say to you that not treating his children right and come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment where children are concerned now if you are not prepared to do that we do have an agenda that we must follow and our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you 
 and so as a result of this we are asking you tonight to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy in memphis go by and tell them not to buy sealtest milk tell them not to buy what is the other bread wonder bread and what is the other bread company jesse tell them not to buy bread as jesse jackson has said up to now only the garbage men have been feeling pain now we must kind of redistribute the pain we are choosing these companies because they been fair in their hiring policies and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike and then they can move on downtown and tell mayor loeb to do what is right 
 but not only that got to strengthen black institutions i call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in bank we want a movement in memphis so go by the savings and loan association not asking you something we do ourselves at sclc judge hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the southern christian leadership conference just telling you to follow what doing put your money there you have six or seven black insurance companies in memphis take out your insurance there we want to have an 
 now these are some practical things we can do we begin the process of building a greater economic base and at the same time we are putting pressure where it really hurts i ask you to follow through here 
 now let me say as i move to my conclusion that got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in memphis got to see it through and when we have our march you need to be there be concerned about your brother you may not be on strike but either we go up together or we go down together 
 let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness one day a man came to jesus and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters in life at points he wanted to trick jesus and show him that he knew a little more than jesus knew and through this throw him off base now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate but jesus immediately pulled that question from and placed it on a dangerous curve between jerusalem and jericho and he talked about a certain man who fell among thieves you remember that a levite and a priest passed by on the other side they stop to help him and finally a man of another race came by he got down from his beast decided not to be compassionate by proxy but with him administering first aid and helped the man in need jesus ended up saying this was the good man this was the great man because he had the capacity to project the i into the thou and to be concerned about his brother now you know we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the levite stop at times we say they were busy going to church meetings an ecclesiastical gathering and they had to get on down to jerusalem so they be late for their meeting at other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that one who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body hours before the ceremony and every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to jerusalem or down to jericho rather to organize a jericho road improvement association a possibility maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root rather than to get bogged down with an individual effort 
 but going to tell you what my imagination tells me possible that these men were afraid you see the jericho road is a dangerous road 
 i remember when mrs king and i were first in jerusalem we rented a car and drove from jerusalem down to jericho and as soon as we got on that road i said to my wife i can see why jesus used this as a setting for his parable a winding meandering road really conducive for ambushing you start out in jerusalem which is about miles or rather feet above sea level and by the time you get down to jericho fifteen or twenty minutes later about feet below sea level a dangerous road in the days of jesus it came to be known as the bloody pass and you know possible that the priest and the levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around or possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking and he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there lure them there for quick and easy seizure and so the first question that the priest asked the first question that the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me but then the good samaritan came by and he reversed the question if i do not stop to help this man what will happen to him 
 the question before you tonight not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to my job not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that i usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor the question is not if i stop to help this man in need what will happen to me the question is if i do not stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to them the question 
 let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness let us stand with a greater determination and let us move on in these powerful days these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be we have an opportunity to make america a better nation and i want to thank god once more for allowing me to be here with you 
 you know several years ago i was in new york city autographing the first book that i had written and while sitting there autographing books a demented black woman came up the only question i heard from her was are you martin luther king and i was looking down writing and i said yes and the next minute i felt something beating on my chest before i knew it i had been stabbed by this demented woman i was rushed to harlem hospital it was a dark saturday afternoon and that blade had gone through and the revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta the main artery and once punctured you drown in your own blood the end of you 
 it came out in the new york times the next morning that if i had merely sneezed i would have died well about four days later they allowed me after the operation after my chest had been opened and the blade had been taken out to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital they allowed me to read some of the mail that came in and from all over the states and the world kind letters came in i read a few but one of them i will never forget i had received one from the president and the forgotten what those telegrams said received a visit and a letter from the governor of new york but forgotten what that letter said but there was another letter that came from a little girl a young girl who was a student at the white plains high school and i looked at that letter and never forget it it said simply dear dr king i am a student at the white plains high school and she said while it should not matter i would like to mention that a white girl i read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering and i read that if you had sneezed you would have died and simply writing you to say that so happy that you sneeze 
 and i want to say tonight i want to say tonight that i too am happy that i sneeze because if i had sneezed i have been around here in when students all over the south started at lunch counters and i knew that as they were sitting in they were really standing up for the best in the american dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the declaration of independence and the constitution if i had sneezed i have been around here in when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in travel if i had sneezed i have been around here in when negroes in albany georgia decided to straighten their backs up and whenever men and women straighten their backs up they are going somewhere because a man ride your back unless it is bent if i had sneezed if i had sneezed i have been here in when the black people of birmingham alabama aroused the conscience of this nation and brought into being the civil rights bill if i had sneezed i have had a chance later that year in august to try to tell america about a dream that i had had if i had sneezed i have been down in selma alabama to see the great movement there if i had sneezed i have been in memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering so happy that i sneeze 
 and they were telling me now it matter now it really matter what happens now i left atlanta this morning and as we got started on the plane there were six of us the pilot said over the public address system we are sorry for the delay but we have dr martin luther king on the plane and to be sure that all of the bags were checked and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane we had to check out everything carefully and had the plane protected and guarded all night 
 and then i got into memphis and some began to say the threats or talk about the threats that were out what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers 
 well i know what will happen now got some difficult days ahead but it matter with me now because been to the mountaintop and i mind 
 like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but not concerned about that now i just want to do will and allowed me to go up to the mountain and looked over and seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get will get to the promised land 
 and so happy tonight not worried about anything not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord 
 
 the man with the 
 theodore teddy roosevelt 
 delivered april 
 over a century ago washington laid the of the capitol in what was then little more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the potomac we now find it necessary to provide great additional buildings for the business of the government this growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has grown we now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population has been outstripped by the growth of wealth and the growth in complex interests 
 the material problems that face us are not such as they were in washingtons time but the underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then under altered external form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in washingtons time and are helped by the same tendencies for good 
 it is about some of these that i wish to say a word in bunyans pilgrims progress you may recall the description of the man with the the man who could look no way but downward with the in his hand who was offered a celestial crown for his but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor 
 in pilgrims progress the man with the is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of on spiritual things yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing now it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing there is filth on the floor and it must be scraped up with the and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed but the man who never does anything else who never thinks or speaks or writes save of his feats with the speedily becomes not a help to society not an incitement to good but one of the most potent forces for evil 
 there are in the body politic economic and social many and grave evils and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them there should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man every evil practice whether in politics in business or in social life i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who on the platform or in book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful the liar is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves it puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest man or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth an epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does not good but very great harm the soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed 
 now it is easy to twist out of shape what i have just said easy to affect to misunderstand it and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it some persons are sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce does not mean the endorsement of whitewashing and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing and those others who practice like to encourage such confusion of ideas one of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked who ought to be exposed who ought if possible to be put in the penitentiary if aristides is praised overmuch as just people get tired of hearing it and overcensure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons results in their favor 
 any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction and unfortunately the reaction instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess is very apt to take the form either of punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity and even strength to offenders the effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in public calamity gross and reckless assaults on character whether on the stump or in newspaper magazine or book create a morbid and vicious public sentiment and at the same time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price 
 as an instance in point i may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the right type of men to dig the panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed both without and i am sorry to say sometimes within congress to utterly reckless assaults on their character and capacity 
 at the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to but for the most unsparing exposure of the politician who betrays his trust of the big business man who makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways there should be a resolute effort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced expose the crime and hunt down the criminal but remember that even in the case of crime if it is attacked in sensational lurid and untruthful fashion the attack may do more damage to the public mind than the crime itself it is because i feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil that i ask that the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution 
 the men with the are often indispensable to the of society but only if they know when to stop raking the muck and to look upward to the celestial crown above them to the crown of worthy endeavor 
 there are beautiful things above and roundabout them and if they gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck their power of usefulness is gone if the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction from their fellows such painting finally induces a kind of moral and people affected by it come to the conclusion that no man is really black and no man is really white but they are all gray in other words they neither believe in the truth of the attack nor in the honesty of the man who is attacked they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense it becomes hopeless to stir them either to wrath against or to enthusiasm for what is right and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave and is the despair of honest men 
 to assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general condemnation means the searing of the public conscience there results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad either attitude is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole the fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad there is nothing more distressing to every good patriot to every good american than the hard scoffing spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter 
 such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot for it denotes not merely the vacant mind but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition 
 there is any amount of good in the world and there never was a time when loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now the forces that tend for evil are great and terrible but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before it is a foolish and timid no less than a wicked thing to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong but it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good 
 hysterical sensationalism is the very poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness the men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time whether in the public press or in magazines or in books are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the work for social and political betterment but if they give good reason for distrust of what they say if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue they thereby betray the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at war 
 in his ecclesiastical polity that fine old elizabethan divine bishop hooker wrote he that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers because they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject but the secret lets and difficulties which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider 
 this truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people desiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of yet on the other hand it is vital not to permit this spirit to sanity and to degenerate into mere mental stagnation bad though a state of hysterical excitement is and evil though the results are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces yet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse 
 at this moment we are passing through a period of great unrestsocial political and industrial unrest it is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness against life of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of conditions but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the individual and the nation so far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce discontent with evil of a determination to punish the authors of evil whether in industry or politics the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life 
 if on the other hand it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite of a contest between the brutal greed of the and the brutal greed of the haves then it has no significance for good but only for evil if it seeks to establish a line of cleavage not along the line which divides good men from bad but along that other line running at right angles thereto which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off then it will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic 
 we can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital the wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to an account for his misdeeds is as bad as and no worse than the labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder one attitude is as bad as the other and no worse in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice and in neither case is there need of action by others which can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime 
 it is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion shall be translated into action and that the action shall be marked by honesty sanity and there is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform the reform that counts is that which comes through steady continuous growth violent emotionalism leads to exhaustion 
 it is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes and the use of those fortunes both corporate and individual in business we should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes and fortunes between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere 
 of course no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in making them as a matter of personal conviction and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system i feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individuala tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual the tax of course to be imposed by the national and not the state government 
 such taxation should of course be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits again the national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in interstate businessand all large corporations are engaged in interstate businesswhether by license or otherwise so as to permit us to deal with the evils of overcapitalization 
 this year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems by the legislation such legislation if so framed as i am sure it will be as to secure definite and tangible results will amount to something of itself and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged in interstate commerce this superintendence and control not to be exercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at large 
 the first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations whether as legislators or as executives is honesty this honesty can be no respecter of persons there can be no such thing as unilateral honesty the danger is not really from corrupt corporations it springs from the corruption itself whether exercised for or against corporations 
 the eighth commandment reads thou shalt not steal it does not read thou shalt not steal from the rich man it does not read thou shalt not steal from the poor man it reads simply and plainly thou shalt not steal 
 no good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense which denounces bribery but blinds itself to blackmail which foams with rage if a corporation secures favors by improper methods and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is itself wronged the only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression 
 if a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to rich corporations it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation 
 but in addition to honesty we need sanity no honesty will make public man useful if that man is timid or foolish if he is a zealot or an impracticable visionary 
 as we strive for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long pull on the contrary there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work to depend only on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset 
 the men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of the public by the proper government authorities will not succeed in my judgment in checking the progress of the movement but if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the whirlwind for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by steady and natural growth 
 on the other hand the wild preachers of unrest and discontent the wild agitators against the entire existing order the men who act crookedly whether because of sinister design or from mere the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute for what they intend to destroy or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than the existing evilsall these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform if they get their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under the present system if they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching would enthrone more securely than ever the very evils which their misguided followers believe they are attacking 
 more important then aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man the welfare of the the welfare of the tiller of the soil upon these depend the welfare of the entire country their good is not to be sought in pulling down others but their good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship 
 materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made 
 spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more important 
 the of national life is and ever must be the high individual character of the average citizen 
 
 remarks on the assassination of martin luther king jr 
 robert f kennedy 
 delivered april indianapolis in 
 ladies and gentlemen only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening because i have some very sad news for all of you could you lower those signs please i have some very sad news for all of you and i think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis tennessee 
 martin luther king dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings he died in the cause of that effort in this difficult day in this difficult time for the united states perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in for those of you who are black considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible you can be filled with bitterness and with hatred and a desire for revenge 
 we can move in that direction as a country in greater polarization black people amongst blacks and white amongst whites filled with hatred toward one another or we can make an effort as martin luther king did to understand and to comprehend and replace that violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand compassion and love 
 for those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling i had a member of my family killed but he was killed by a white man 
 but we have to make an effort in the united states we have to make an effort to understand to get beyond or go beyond these rather difficult times 
 my favorite poem my favorite poet was aeschylus and he once wrote 
 even in our sleep pain which cannot forget 
 falls drop by drop upon the heart 
 until in our own despair 
 against our will 
 comes wisdom 
 through the awful grace of god 
 what we need in the united states is not division what we need in the united states is not hatred what we need in the united states is not violence and lawlessness but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country whether they be white or whether they be black 
 so i ask you tonight to return home to say a prayer for the family of martin luther king yeah true but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country which all of us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which i spoke 
 we can do well in this country we will have difficult times had difficult times in the past and we will have difficult times in the future it is not the end of violence it is not the end of lawlessness and not the end of disorder 
 but the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land 
 let us dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world let us dedicate ourselves to that and say a prayer for our country and for our people 
 thank you very much 
 
 farewell address 
 dwight d eisenhower 
 delivered january 
 good evening my fellow americans 
 first i should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation my special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening 
 three days from now after a half century in the service of our country i shall lay down the responsibilities of office as in traditional and solemn ceremony the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor 
 this evening i come to you with a message of and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you my countrymen like every other citizen i wish the new president and all who will labor with him godspeed i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all 
 our people expect their president and the congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation my own relations with the congress which began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member of the senate appointed me to west point have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate period and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years in this final relationship the congress and the administration have on most vital issues cooperated well to serve the nation good rather than mere partisanship and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward so my official relationship with congress ends in a feeling on my part of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together 
 we now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations three of these involved our own country despite these holocausts america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this we yet realize that leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment 
 throughout adventure in free government our basic purposes have been to keep the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations to strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad 
 progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world it commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration to meet it successfully there is called for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake only thus shall we remain despite every provocation on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment 
 crises there will continue to be in meeting them whether foreign or domestic great or small there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties a huge increase in newer elements of our defenses development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research these and many other possibilities each possibly promising in itself may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel 
 but each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs balance between the private and the public economy balance between the cost and hoped for advantages balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future good judgment seeks balance and progress lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration the record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have in the main understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress 
 but threats new in kind or degree constantly arise of these i mention two only 
 a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea 
 until the latest of our world conflicts the united states had no armaments industry american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all united states corporations 
 now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society 
 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together 
 akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades in this revolution research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly a steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the federal government 
 today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers the prospect of domination of the scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded 
 yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a elite 
 it is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and old within the principles of our democratic system c ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society 
 another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time as we peer into future we you and i and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow 
 during the long lane of the history yet to be written america knows that this world of ours ever growing smaller must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate and be instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect such a confederation must be one of equals the weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we protected as we are by our moral economic and military strength that table though scarred by many past frustrations cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield 
 disarmament with mutual honor and confidence is a continuing imperative together we must learn how to compose differences not with arms but with intellect and decent purpose because this need is so sharp and apparent i confess that i lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment as one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years i wish i could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight 
 happily i can say that war has been avoided steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made but so much remains to be done as a private citizen i shall never cease to do what little i can to help the world advance along that road 
 so in this my last good night to you as your president i thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace i trust that in that service you find some things worthy as for the rest of it i know you will find ways to improve performance in the future 
 you and i my fellow citizens need to be strong in our faith that all nations under god will reach the goal of peace with justice may we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the nations great goals 
 to all the peoples of the world i once more give expression to prayerful and continuing aspiration we pray that peoples of all faiths all races all nations may have their great human needs satisfied that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity and that the scourges of poverty disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth and that in the goodness of time all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love 
 now on friday noon i am to become a private citizen i am proud to do so i look forward to it 
 thank you and good night 
 
 war message 
 woodrow wilson 
 delivered april 
 gentlemen of the congress 
 i have called the congress into extraordinary session because there are serious very serious choices of policy to be made and made immediately which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of making 
 on the third of february last i officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the first day of february it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of great britain and ireland or the western coasts of europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of germany within the mediterranean 
 that had seemed to be the object of the german submarine warfare earlier in the war but since april of last year the imperial government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy when no resistance was offered or escape attempted and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats 
 the precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain degree of restraint was observed the new policy has swept every restriction aside vessels of every kind whatever their flag their character their cargo their destination their errand have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the german government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity haven been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle 
 i was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations international law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world by painful stage after stage has that law been built up with meager enough results indeed after all was accomplished that could be accomplished but always with a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded 
 this minimum of right the german government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world 
 i am not now thinking of the loss of property involved immense and serious as that is but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of men women and children engaged in pursuits which have always even in the darkest periods of modern history been deemed innocent and legitimate property can be paid for the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be 
 the present german submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind 
 it is war against all nations 
 american ships have been sunk american lives taken in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way there has been no discrimination the challenge is to all mankind 
 each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it the choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation we must put excited feeling away our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right of human right of which we are only a single champion 
 when i addressed the congress on the of february last i thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms our right to use the seas against unlawful interference our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence but armed neutrality it now appears is impracticable because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the german submarines have been used against merchant shipping it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers visible craft giving chase upon the open sea it is common prudence in such circumstances grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention they must be dealt with upon sight if dealt with at all 
 the german government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend the intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents there is one choice we cannot make we are incapable of making we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated the wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs they cut to the very roots of human life 
 with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves but in unhesitating obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the government of the german empire to terms and end the war 
 what this will involve is clear 
 it will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with germany and as incident to that the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs 
 it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible 
 it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemys submarines 
 it will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the united states already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred thousand men who should in my opinion be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training 
 it will involve also of course the granting of adequate credits to the government sustained i hope so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation by well conceived taxation 
 i say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed it is our duty i most respectfully urge to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans 
 in carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty for it will be a very practical duty of supplying the nations already at war with germany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance they are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there 
 i shall take the liberty of suggesting through the several executive departments of the government for the consideration of your committees measures for the accomplishment of the several objects i have mentioned i hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall 
 while we do these things these deeply momentous things let us be very clear and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are my own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months and i do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them i have exactly the same things in mind now that i had in mind when i addressed the senate on the of january last the same that i had in mind when i addressed the congress on the third day of february and on the of february our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and peoples of the world 
 such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles 
 neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will not by the will of their people we have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances we are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states 
 we have no quarrel with the german people we have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship it was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war it was not with their previous knowledge or approval it was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools 
 nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression carried it may be from generation to generation can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class they are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nations affairs 
 a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations no autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants it must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion intrigue would eat its vitals away the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own 
 does not every american feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in russia russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart in all the vital habits of her thought in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct their habitual attitude towards life 
 the autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power was not in fact russian in origin character or purpose and now it has been shaken off and the great generous russian people have been added in all their majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world for justice and for peace here is a fit partner for a league of honor 
 one of the things that has served to convince us that the prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel our peace within and without our industries and our commerce indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation wit the support and even under the personal direction of official agents of the imperial government accredited to the government of the united states 
 even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we know that their source lay not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people towards us who were no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves were but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing but they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience that it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors that intercepted note to the german minister at mexico city is eloquent evidence 
 we are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government following such methods we can never have a friend and that in the presence of its organized power always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can be no assured security of the democratic governments of the world we are now about to accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power 
 we are glad now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the german peoples included for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience the world must be made safe for democracy its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty we have no selfish ends to serve 
 we desire no conquest no dominion we seek no indemnities for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make we are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind we shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them 
 just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples we shall i feel confident conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for i have said nothing of the governments allied with the imperial government of germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor 
 the government has indeed avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the imperial german government and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive count tarnowski the ambassador recently accredited to this government by the imperial and royal government of but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the united states on the seas and i take the liberty for the present at least of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at vienna 
 we enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights 
 it will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them but only armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck 
 we are let me say again the sincere friends of the german people and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us however hard it may be for them for the time being to believe that this is spoken from our hearts 
 we have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible 
 we shall happily still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of german birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test they are most of them as true and loyal americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance they will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose if there should be disloyalty it will be dealt with a firm hand of stern repression but if it lifts its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few 
 it is a distressing and oppressive duty gentlemen of the congress which i have performed in thus addressing you there are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance 
 but the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small nations for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world at last free 
 to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day has come when america is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured god helping her she can do no other
