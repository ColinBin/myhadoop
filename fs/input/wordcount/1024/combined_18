 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he 
 now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved 
 there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people who on the contrary desire above all to find in that successful rival the qualities by which he has worsted them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face everything about his face and figure from his black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty 
 as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with an especially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her 
 greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him 
 let me introduce you said the princess indicating levin constantin dmitrievich levin count alexei kirillovich vronsky 
 vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him 
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter he said smiling his simple and open smile but you had unexpectedly left for the country 
 constantin dmitrievich despises and hates the town and us townspeople said countess nordstone 
 my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well said levin and suddenly becoming conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened 
 vronsky looked at levin and countess nordstone and smiled 
 are you always in the country he inquired i should think it must be dull in the winter 
 not dull if one has work to do besides not dull by oneself levin replied abruptly 
 i am fond of the country said vronsky noticing yet affecting not to notice tone 
 but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always said countess nordstone 
 i know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once he went on i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and just there that russia comes back to mind most vividly and especially the country as though 
 he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head 
 noticing that countess nordstone wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her 
 the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the old princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns the classical and professional education and universal military service had not to move out either of them while countess nordstone had no chance of chaffing levin 
 levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant now go he still did not go as though waiting for something 
 the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits and countess nordstone who believed in spiritualism began to describe the miracles she had seen 
 ah countess you really must take me for sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere said vronsky smiling 
 very well next saturday answered countess nordstone but you constantin dmitrievich are you a believer she asked levin 
 why do you ask me you know what i shall say 
 but i want to hear your opinion 
 my opinion answered levin is merely that this table turning proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and conjurations while we 
 oh then you a believer 
 i believe countess 
 but if seen for myself 
 the peasant women too tell us they have seen hobgoblins 
 then you think i tell a lie 
 and she laughed a mirthless laugh 
 oh no masha constantin dmitrievich merely said he could not believe said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable 
 you do not admit the possibility at all he queried but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which 
 when electricity was discovered levin interrupted hurriedly it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists on the contrary have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force 
 vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words 
 yes but the spiritualists say we know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists of no i see why there should not be a new force if it 
 why because with electricity levin interrupted again every time you rub tar against wool a certain phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon 
 feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies 
 do let us try at once countess he said but levin would finish saying what he thought 
 i think he went on that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment 
 everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt this 
 why i think you would be a medium said countess nordstone something enthusiastic about you 
 levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing 
 do let us try table turning at once please said vronsky princess will you allow it 
 and vronsky stood up looking about for a little table 
 kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the cause if you can forgive me forgive me said her eyes i am so happy 
 i hate them all and you and myself his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin 
 ah he began joyously been here long my boy i even know you were in town very glad to see you the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was calmly waiting till the prince should turn to him 
 kitty felt how grievous her cordiality was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him and she flushed 
 prince let us have constantin dmitrievich said countess nordstone we want to try an experiment 
 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball

 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball

 at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with levin and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin she was glad at the thought that she had received a proposal she had no doubt that she had acted rightly but after she had gone to bed she could not sleep for a long while one impression pursued her relentlessly it was face with his scowling brows and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them as he stood listening to her father and glancing at her and at vronsky and she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes but immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up she vividly recalled his manly firm face his noble calmness and the good nature so conspicuous toward everyone she remembered the love for her of the man she loved and once more all was gladness in her soul and she lay on the pillow smiling with happiness sorry sorry but what could i do not my fault she said to herself but an inner voice told her otherwise whether she felt remorse at having captivated levin or at having refused him she did not know but her happiness was poisoned by doubts lord have pity on us lord have pity lord have pity she said over to herself till she fell asleep 
 meanwhile there took place below in the little study one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter 
 what tell you what shouted the prince brandishing his arms and at once wrapping his dressing gown round him again that no pride no dignity that disgracing ruining your daughter by this vulgar stupid matchmaking 
 but really for sake prince what have i done said the princess almost crying 
 she pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter had gone to the prince to say good night as usual and though she had no intention of telling him of proposal and refusal still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with vronsky and would be definitely so as soon as his mother arrived and thereupon at those words the prince had all at once flown into a passion and begun to use unseemly language 
 what have you done tell you what first of all trying to allure an eligible gentleman and all moscow will be talking of it and with good reason if you have evening parties invite everyone pick out the possible suitors invite all these whelps so the prince styled the youths of moscow engage a piano player and let them dance and not as you did tonight only the wooers and doing your matching it makes me sick sick to see it and gone on till turned the poor head a thousand times the better man as for this peterburg swell turned out by machinery all on one pattern and all precious rubbish but if he were a prince of the blood my daughter need not run after anyone 
 but what have i done 
 why the prince was yelling wrathfully 
 i know if one were to listen to you interrupted the princess we should never marry off our daughter if to be so better go into the country 
 well we had better 
 but do wait a minute do i wheedle them i wheedle them in the least a young man and a very nice one has fallen in love with her and she i fancy 
 oh yes you fancy and how if she really is in love and no more thinking of marriage than i am oh that i should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball and the prince imagining that he was mimicking his wife made a mincing curtsy at each word and this is how we prepare wretchedness for katenka and really got the notion into her head 
 but what makes you suppose so 
 i suppose i know for such things we have eyes womenfolk i see a man who has serious intentions levin and i see a quail like this cackler only amusing himself 
 oh well when once you get an idea into your head 
 well remember my words but too late just as with dashenka 
 well well we talk of it the princess stopped him recollecting her unlucky dolly 
 by all means and good night 
 and signing each other with the cross the husband and wife parted with a kiss feeling that each remained of his or her own opinion 
 the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled fortune and that there could be no doubt of intentions but her words had disturbed her and returning to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeated several times in her heart lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity

 vronsky had never had a real home life his mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman who had had during her married life and still more afterward many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remembered and he had been educated in the corps of pages 
 leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer he had at once got into the circle of wealthy peterburg army men although he did go more or less into peterburg society his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it 
 in moscow he had for the first time felt after his luxurious and coarse life at peterburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who cared for him it never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty at balls he danced principally with her he was a constant visitor at her house he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all sorts of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him and the more he felt this the better he liked it and the tenderer was his feeling for her he did not know that this mode of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was it seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure and he was enjoying his discovery 
 if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her he would have been greatly astonished and would not have believed it he could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him and above all to her could be wrong still less could he have believed that he ought to marry 
 marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility he not only disliked family life but a family and especially a husband in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived were conceived as something alien repellent and above all ridiculous but though vronsky had not the least suspicion of what the parents were saying he felt on coming away from the that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken but what step could and should be taken he could not imagine

 chapter 
 
 next day at eleven in the morning vronsky drove to the station of the peterburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was oblonsky who was expecting his sister by the same train 
 ah your excellency cried oblonsky whom are you meeting 
 my mother vronsky responded smiling as everyone did who met oblonsky he shook hands with him and together they ascended the steps she is to be here from peterburg today 
 i was looking out for you till two last night where did you go from the 
 home answered vronsky i must own i felt so well content yesterday after the that i care to go anywhere 
 i can tell the gallant by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich just as he had done before to levin 
 vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it but he promptly changed the subject 
 and whom are you meeting he asked 
 i come to meet a pretty woman said oblonsky 
 so it 
 honi soit qui mal y pense my sister anna 
 ah madame karenina said vronsky 
 you know her no doubt 
 i think i do or perhaps not i really am not sure vronsky answered heedlessly with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name karenina 
 but alexei alexandrovich my celebrated you surely must know all the world knows him 
 i know him by reputation and by sight i know that clever learned religious somewhat but you know not not in my line said vronsky in english 
 yes a very remarkable man rather a conservative but a very nice man observed stepan arkadyevich a very nice man 
 oh well so much the better for him said vronsky smiling oh come he said addressing a tall old footman of his standing at the door come here 
 besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with kitty 
 well what do you say shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva he said to him with a smile taking his arm 
 of course collecting subscriptions oh did you make the acquaintance of my friend levin asked stepan arkadyevich 
 yes but he left rather early 
 a capital fellow pursued oblonsky he 
 i know why it is responded vronsky in all moscow people present company of course excepted he put in jestingly something uncompromising they are all on the defensive lose their tempers as though they all want to make one feel something 
 yes true so said stepan arkadyevich laughing cheerfully 
 will the train be in soon vronsky asked a railway official

 chapter 
 
 vronsky followed the guard to the carriage and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out 
 with the habitual feeling of a man of the world from one glance at this appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society he begged pardon and was getting into the carriage but felt he must glance at her once more not because she was very beautiful not because of that elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure but because in the expression of her charming face as she passed close by him there was something peculiarly caressing and soft as he looked round she too turned her head her shining gray eyes that looked dark because of her thick lashes rested with friendly attention on his face as though she were recognizing him and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd as though seeking someone in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation which played over her face and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips it was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes and now in her smile deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile 
 vronsky stepped into the carriage his mother a old lady with black eyes and ringlets screwed up her eyes scanning her son and smiled slightly with her thin lips getting up from the seat and handing her maid a handbag she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss and lifting his head from her hand kissed him on the cheek 
 you got my telegram quite well thank god 
 you had a good journey said her son sitting down beside her and involuntarily listening to a voice outside the door he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door 
 all the same i agree with you said the voice 
 the peterburg view madame 
 not peterburg but simply feminine she responded 
 well well allow me to kiss your hand 
 ivan petrovich and would you see if my brother is here and send him to me said the lady in the doorway and stepped back again into the compartment 
 well have you found your brother said countess vronskaia addressing the lady 
 vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina 
 your brother is here he said standing up excuse me i did not know you and indeed our acquaintance was so slight said vronsky bowing that no doubt you do not remember me 
 oh no said she i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking i think of nothing but you all the way as she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile and still no sign of my brother 
 do call him aliosha said the old countess 
 vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted oblonsky here 
 madame karenina however did not wait for her brother but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light resolute step and as soon as her brother had reached her with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace she flung her left arm around his neck drew him rapidly to her and kissed him warmly vronsky looked on never taking his eyes from her and smiled he could not have said why but recollecting that his mother was waiting for him he went back again into the carriage 
 
 very sweet she said the countess of madame karenina her husband put her with me and i was delighted to have her been talking all the way and so you i hear vous filez le parfait amour tant mieux mon cher tant mieux 
 i know what you are referring to maman he answered coldly come maman let us go 
 madame karenina entered the carriage again to say to the countess 
 well countess you have met your son and i my brother she said gaily and all my stories are exhausted i should have nothing more to tell you 
 oh no said the countess taking her hand i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company sweet either to be silent or to chat now please fret over your son you expect never to be parted 
 madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling 
 anna arkadyevna the countess said in explanation to her son has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him 
 yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him 
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess 
 thank you so much the time has passed so quickly countess 
 my love answered the countess let me kiss your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that lost my heart to you 
 stereotyped as the phrase was madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it she flushed bent down slightly and put her cheek to the lips drew herself up again and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes she gave her hand to vronsky he pressed the little hand she gave him and was delighted as though at something special by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness 
 very charming said the countess 
 that was precisely what her son was thinking his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight and then the smile remained on his face he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother put her arm in his and began telling him something animatedly obviously something that had nothing to do with him vronsky and at that he felt annoyed 
 well maman are you perfectly well he repeated turning to his mother 
 everything has been delightful alexandre has been very good and marie has grown very pretty very interesting 
 and she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson for which she had been staying in peterburg and the special favor shown her elder son by the czar 
 lavrentii said vronsky looking out of the window now we can go if you like 
 the old butler who had traveled with the countess came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready and the countess got up to go 
 come not such a crowd now said vronsky 
 the maid took a handbag and the lap dog the butler and a porter the other baggage vronsky gave his mother his arm but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with faces the stationmaster too ran by in his extraordinarily colored cap obviously something unusual had happened the crowd was running to the tail end of the train 
 what what where flung himself crushed was heard among the crowd 
 stepan arkadyevich with his sister on his arm turned back they too looked scared and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd 
 the ladies got in while vronsky and stepan arkadyevich followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster 
 a watchman either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost had not heard the train moving back and had been crushed 
 before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler 
 oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse oblonsky was evidently distressed he frowned and seemed ready to cry 
 ah how awful ah anna if you had seen it ah how awful he kept repeating 
 vronsky did not speak his handsome face was serious but perfectly calm 
 ah if you had seen it countess said stepan arkadyevich and his wife was there it was awful to see her she flung herself on the body they say he was the only support of an immense family how awful 
 one do anything for her said madame karenina in an agitated whisper 
 vronsky glanced at her and immediately got out of the carriage 
 be back directly maman he remarked turning round in the doorway 
 when he came back a few minutes later stepan arkadyevich was already in conversation with the countess about a new singer while she was impatiently looking toward the door waiting for her son 
 now let us be off said vronsky coming in 
 they went out together vronsky was in front with his mother behind walked madame karenina with her brother just as they were going out of the station the stationmaster overtook vronsky 
 you gave my assistant two hundred roubles would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them 
 for the widow said vronsky shrugging his shoulders i should have thought there was no need to ask 
 you gave that cried oblonsky behind and pressing his hand he added most charming most charming he a fine fellow countess 
 and he and his sister stood still looking for her maid 
 when they went out the carriage had already driven away people coming in were still talking of what had happened 
 what a horrible death said a gentleman passing by they say he was cut in two 
 on the contrary i think the easiest instantaneous observed another 
 how is it they take proper precautions a third was saying 
 madame karenina seated herself in the carriage and stepan arkadyevich saw with surprise that her lips were quivering and that she was with difficulty restraining her tears 
 what is it anna he asked when they had driven a few hundred sagenes 
 an omen of evil she said 
 what nonsense said stepan arkadyevich come the chief thing you conceive how resting my hopes on you 
 have you known vronsky long she asked 
 yes you know hoping he will marry kitty 
 yes said anna softly come now let us talk of you she added tossing her head as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her let us talk of your affairs i got your letter and here i am 
 yes all my hopes are in you said stepan arkadyevich 
 well tell me all about it 
 and stepan arkadyevich began his story 
 on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out sighed pressed her hand and set off to his office

 vronsky followed the guard to the carriage and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out 
 with the habitual feeling of a man of the world from one glance at this appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society he begged pardon and was getting into the carriage but felt he must glance at her once more not because she was very beautiful not because of that elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure but because in the expression of her charming face as she passed close by him there was something peculiarly caressing and soft as he looked round she too turned her head her shining gray eyes that looked dark because of her thick lashes rested with friendly attention on his face as though she were recognizing him and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd as though seeking someone in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation which played over her face and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips it was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes and now in her smile deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile 
 vronsky stepped into the carriage his mother a old lady with black eyes and ringlets screwed up her eyes scanning her son and smiled slightly with her thin lips getting up from the seat and handing her maid a handbag she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss and lifting his head from her hand kissed him on the cheek 
 you got my telegram quite well thank god 
 you had a good journey said her son sitting down beside her and involuntarily listening to a voice outside the door he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door 
 all the same i agree with you said the voice 
 the peterburg view madame 
 not peterburg but simply feminine she responded 
 well well allow me to kiss your hand 
 ivan petrovich and would you see if my brother is here and send him to me said the lady in the doorway and stepped back again into the compartment 
 well have you found your brother said countess vronskaia addressing the lady 
 vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina 
 your brother is here he said standing up excuse me i did not know you and indeed our acquaintance was so slight said vronsky bowing that no doubt you do not remember me 
 oh no said she i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking i think of nothing but you all the way as she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile and still no sign of my brother 
 do call him aliosha said the old countess 
 vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted oblonsky here 
 madame karenina however did not wait for her brother but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light resolute step and as soon as her brother had reached her with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace she flung her left arm around his neck drew him rapidly to her and kissed him warmly vronsky looked on never taking his eyes from her and smiled he could not have said why but recollecting that his mother was waiting for him he went back again into the carriage 
 
 very sweet she said the countess of madame karenina her husband put her with me and i was delighted to have her been talking all the way and so you i hear vous filez le parfait amour tant mieux mon cher tant mieux 
 i know what you are referring to maman he answered coldly come maman let us go 
 madame karenina entered the carriage again to say to the countess 
 well countess you have met your son and i my brother she said gaily and all my stories are exhausted i should have nothing more to tell you 
 oh no said the countess taking her hand i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company sweet either to be silent or to chat now please fret over your son you expect never to be parted 
 madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling 
 anna arkadyevna the countess said in explanation to her son has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him 
 yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him 
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess 
 thank you so much the time has passed so quickly countess 
 my love answered the countess let me kiss your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that lost my heart to you

 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you 
 i am glad too said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of face to find out whether she knew most likely she knows she thought noticing the sympathy in face well come along take you to your room she went on trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation 
 is this grisha heavens how grown said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed no please let us stay here 
 she took off her shawl and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down 
 you are radiant with health and happiness said dolly almost with envy 
 i yes said anna merciful heavens tania the same age as my seriozha she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her delightful child delightful show me them all 
 she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that 
 very well we will go to them she said a pity asleep 
 after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawing room to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her 
 dolly she said he has told me 
 dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases but anna said nothing of the sort 
 dolly darling she said i want to intercede for him nor to try to comfort you impossible but my dearest simply sorry sorry from my heart for you 
 under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her and took her hand in her own vigorous and little dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said 
 to comfort me is impossible lost after what has happened over 
 and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said 
 but dolly to be done to be done how is it best to act in this awful position what you must think of 
 over and nothing more said dolly and the worst of it all is you see that i cast him off there are the children my hands are tied and i live with him a torture for me to see him 
 dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me all about it 
 dolly looked at her inquiringly 
 sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on face 
 very well she suddenly said but i will begin at the beginning you know how i was married with the education maman gave us i was more than innocent i was foolish i knew nothing they say i know men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva she corrected herself stepan arkadyevich told me nothing hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was not only far from suspecting infidelity but i regarded it as impossible and then try to imagine it with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of happiness and all at once continued dolly holding back her sobs to get a letter his letter to his mistress a governess in my employ no too awful she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it i can understand if it were passion she went on after a brief silence but to deceive me deliberately slyly and with whom to go on being my husband while he and she awful you understand 
 oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand said anna pressing her hand 
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position dolly resumed not in the slightest happy and contented 
 oh no anna interposed quickly to be pitied weighed down by remorse 
 is he capable of remorse dolly interrupted gazing intently into her face 
 yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him but proud and now so humiliated what touched me most and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most tortured by two things that ashamed for the sake and that loving you yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have rejoined he has hurt you pierced you to the heart no no she cannot forgive me he keeps on saying 
 dolly looked pensively past her as she listened to her words 
 yes i can see that his position is awful worse for the guilty than the innocent she said if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him 
 and sobs cut short her words 
 but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her 
 young you see pretty she went on do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent about me do you understand 
 again her eyes glowed with hatred 
 and after that he will tell me what am i to believe him never no everything is over everything that once constituted my comfort the reward of my work and of my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why to have children so awful is that all at once my turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him and 
 darling dolly i understand but torture yourself you are so insulted so excited that you look at many things mistakenly 
 dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent 
 to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing 
 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did 
 no he understands and understood dolly broke in but i you are forgetting me does that make it easier for me 
 wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the horror of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling while i fully realize your sufferings there is one thing i know i know i know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him 
 no dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more 
 i know more of the world than you do she said i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their own home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that be crossed between them and their families i understand it but it is so 
 yes but he has kissed her 
 dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word a marvelous woman have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been a passion of the heart 
 but if it be repeated 
 it cannot be as i understand it 
 yes but could you forgive it 
 i know i judge no i can judge said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive i could not be the same no but i could forgive and forgive as though it had never been never been at all 
 oh of course dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go take you to your room she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better

 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you 
 i am glad too said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of face to find out whether she knew most likely she knows she thought noticing the sympathy in face well come along take you to your room she went on trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation 
 is this grisha heavens how grown said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed no please let us stay here 
 she took off her shawl and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down 
 you are radiant with health and happiness said dolly almost with envy 
 i yes said anna merciful heavens tania the same age as my seriozha she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her delightful child delightful show me them all 
 she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that 
 very well we will go to them she said a pity asleep 
 after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawing room to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her 
 dolly she said he has told me 
 dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases but anna said nothing of the sort 
 dolly darling she said i want to intercede for him nor to try to comfort you impossible but my dearest simply sorry sorry from my heart for you 
 under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her and took her hand in her own vigorous and little dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said 
 to comfort me is impossible lost after what has happened over 
 and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said 
 but dolly to be done to be done how is it best to act in this awful position what you must think of 
 over and nothing more said dolly and the worst of it all is you see that i cast him off there are the children my hands are tied and i live with him a torture for me to see him 
 dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me all about it 
 dolly looked at her inquiringly 
 sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on face 
 very well she suddenly said but i will begin at the beginning you know how i was married with the education maman gave us i was more than innocent i was foolish i knew nothing they say i know men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva she corrected herself stepan arkadyevich told me nothing hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was not only far from suspecting infidelity but i regarded it as impossible and then try to imagine it with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of happiness and all at once continued dolly holding back her sobs to get a letter his letter to his mistress a governess in my employ no too awful she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it i can understand if it were passion she went on after a brief silence but to deceive me deliberately slyly and with whom to go on being my husband while he and she awful you understand 
 oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand said anna pressing her hand 
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position dolly resumed not in the slightest happy and contented 
 oh no anna interposed quickly to be pitied weighed down by remorse 
 is he capable of remorse dolly interrupted gazing intently into her face 
 yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him but proud and now so humiliated what touched me most and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most tortured by two things that ashamed for the sake and that loving you yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have rejoined he has hurt you pierced you to the heart no no she cannot forgive me he keeps on saying 
 dolly looked pensively past her as she listened to her words 
 yes i can see that his position is awful worse for the guilty than the innocent she said if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him 
 and sobs cut short her words 
 but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her 
 young you see pretty she went on do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent about me do you understand 
 again her eyes glowed with hatred 
 and after that he will tell me what am i to believe him never no everything is over everything that once constituted my comfort the reward of my work and of my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why to have children so awful is that all at once my turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him and 
 darling dolly i understand but torture yourself you are so insulted so excited that you look at many things mistakenly 
 dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent 
 to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing 
 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did 
 no he understands and understood dolly broke in but i you are forgetting me does that make it easier for me 
 wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the horror of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling while i fully realize your sufferings there is one thing i know i know i know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him 
 no dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more 
 i know more of the world than you do she said i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their own home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that be crossed between them and their families i understand it but it is so 
 yes but he has kissed her 
 dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word a marvelous woman have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been a passion of the heart 
 but if it be repeated 
 it cannot be as i understand it 
 yes but could you forgive it 
 i know i judge no i can judge said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive i could not be the same no but i could forgive and forgive as though it had never been never been at all 
 oh of course dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go take you to your room she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better

 chapter 
 
 the whole of that day anna spent at home that is at the and received no one though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival and came to call the same day anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home come god is merciful she wrote 
 oblonsky did dine at home the conversation was general and his wife speaking to him addressed him as stiva as she had not done for some time past in the relations of husband and wife the same estrangement still remained but there was no talk of separation and stepan arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation 
 immediately after dinner kitty came in she knew anna arkadyevna but only very slightly and she came now to her with some trepidation at the prospect of meeting this fashionable peterburg lady of whom everyone spoke so highly but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna she perceived that at once anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under sway but in love with her as young girls do fall in love with older and married women anna did not resemble a fashionable lady or the mother of a boy eight years old in the elasticity of her movements the freshness and the animation which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty had it not been for a serious and at times a mournful look in her eyes which struck and attracted kitty kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing but that she had another higher world of interests complex and poetic which were inaccessible to kitty 
 after dinner when dolly withdrew to her own room anna rose quickly and went up to her brother who was just lighting a cigar 
 stiva she said to him winking gaily making the sign of the cross over him and glancing toward the door go and god help you 
 he tossed away his cigar having understood her and departed through the doorway 
 when stepan arkadyevich had disappeared she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her the two elder ones and the younger following their lead as children so often do had clung about their new aunt since before dinner and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt to touch her hold her little hand kiss it play with her ring or even touch the flounce of her skirt 
 come come as we were sitting before said anna arkadyevna sitting down in her place 
 and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness 
 and when is your next ball she asked kitty 
 next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself 
 why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself anna said with tender irony 
 strange but there are at the one always enjoys oneself and at the too while at the always dull you noticed it 
 no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her for me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others 
 how can you be dull at a ball 
 why should not i be dull at a ball inquired anna 
 kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow 
 because you always look the loveliest of all 
 anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed and said

 the whole of that day anna spent at home that is at the and received no one though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival and came to call the same day anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home come god is merciful she wrote 
 oblonsky did dine at home the conversation was general and his wife speaking to him addressed him as stiva as she had not done for some time past in the relations of husband and wife the same estrangement still remained but there was no talk of separation and stepan arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation 
 immediately after dinner kitty came in she knew anna arkadyevna but only very slightly and she came now to her with some trepidation at the prospect of meeting this fashionable peterburg lady of whom everyone spoke so highly but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna she perceived that at once anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under sway but in love with her as young girls do fall in love with older and married women anna did not resemble a fashionable lady or the mother of a boy eight years old in the elasticity of her movements the freshness and the animation which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty had it not been for a serious and at times a mournful look in her eyes which struck and attracted kitty kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing but that she had another higher world of interests complex and poetic which were inaccessible to kitty 
 after dinner when dolly withdrew to her own room anna rose quickly and went up to her brother who was just lighting a cigar 
 stiva she said to him winking gaily making the sign of the cross over him and glancing toward the door go and god help you 
 he tossed away his cigar having understood her and departed through the doorway 
 when stepan arkadyevich had disappeared she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her the two elder ones and the younger following their lead as children so often do had clung about their new aunt since before dinner and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt to touch her hold her little hand kiss it play with her ring or even touch the flounce of her skirt 
 come come as we were sitting before said anna arkadyevna sitting down in her place 
 and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness 
 and when is your next ball she asked kitty 
 next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself 
 why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself anna said with tender irony

 no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her for me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others 
 how can you be dull at a ball 
 why should not i be dull at a ball inquired anna 
 kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow 
 because you always look the loveliest of all 
 anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed and said

 dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownups stepan arkadyevich did not come out he must have left his room by a back door 
 i am afraid be cold upstairs observed dolly addressing anna i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer 
 oh please trouble about me answered anna looking intently into face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not 
 it will be lighter for you here answered her 
 i assure you that i can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any time 
 all this inquired stepan arkadyevich coming out of his room and addressing his wife 
 from his tone both kitty and anna at once gathered that a reconciliation had taken place 
 i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself answered dolly addressing him 
 god knows whether they are fully reconciled thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed 
 come dolly why be always making difficulties answered her husband there do it all if you like 
 i know how you do everything answered dolly you tell matvei to do what be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of lips as she spoke 
 full full reconciliation full thought anna thank god and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her 
 not at all why do you always look down on me and matvei said stepan arkadyevich smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife 
 the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevich was happy and cheerful yet not so as to seem as if having been forgiven he had forgotten his fault 
 at nine a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange having begun talking about common acquaintances in peterburg anna got up quickly 
 she is in my album she said and by the way show you my seriozha she added with a smile of pride 
 toward ten when she usually said good night to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her seriozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase 
 just as she was leaving the drawing room a ring was heard in the hall 
 who can that be said dolly 
 too early for me to be fetched and for anyone else too late observed kitty 
 sure to be someone with papers for me put in stepan arkadyevich when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of some dread stirred in her heart he stood there without taking off his coat and pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and the expression of his face changed to embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and calm voice of vronsky refusing 
 when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity 
 and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is added stepan arkadyevich 
 kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up he has been at home she thought and find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and here 
 all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at album 
 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a calling at nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in yet it seemed strange to all of them and to anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than to any of the others

 i am afraid be cold upstairs observed dolly addressing anna i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer 
 oh please trouble about me answered anna looking intently into face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not 
 it will be lighter for you here answered her 
 i assure you that i can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any time 
 all this inquired stepan arkadyevich coming out of his room and addressing his wife 
 from his tone both kitty and anna at once gathered that a reconciliation had taken place 
 i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself answered dolly addressing him 
 god knows whether they are fully reconciled thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed 
 come dolly why be always making difficulties answered her husband there do it all if you like 
 i know how you do everything answered dolly you tell matvei to do what be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of lips as she spoke 
 full full reconciliation full thought anna thank god and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her 
 not at all why do you always look down on me and matvei said stepan arkadyevich smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife 
 the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevich was happy and cheerful yet not so as to seem as if having been forgiven he had forgotten his fault 
 at nine a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange having begun talking about common acquaintances in peterburg anna got up quickly 
 she is in my album she said and by the way show you my seriozha she added with a smile of pride 
 toward ten when she usually said good night to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her seriozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase 
 just as she was leaving the drawing room a ring was heard in the hall 
 who can that be said dolly 
 too early for me to be fetched and for anyone else too late observed kitty 
 sure to be someone with papers for me put in stepan arkadyevich when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of some dread stirred in her heart he stood there without taking off his coat and pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and the expression of his face changed to embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and calm voice of vronsky refusing 
 when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity 
 and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is added stepan arkadyevich 
 kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up he has been at home she thought and find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and here 
 all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at album 
 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a calling at nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in yet it seemed strange to all of them and to anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than to any of the others

 the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase flooded with light and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats from the rooms came a constant steady noise like that of a hive aswarm and as they were giving the final little touches to hair and dresses before a mirror on the landing between potted trees they heard coming from the ballroom the gently distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little ancient in civilian dress arranging his gray curls before another mirror and diffusing an odor of scent stumbled against them on the stairs and stood aside evidently admiring kitty whom he did not know a beardless youth one of those society youths whom the old prince shcherbatsky called whelps in an exceedingly open waistcoat straightening his white tie as he went bowed to them and after running by came back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky she had to promise this youth the second an officer buttoning his glove stood aside in the doorway and stroking his mustache admired the rosy kitty 
 although her dress her coiffure and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty much trouble and planning at this moment she walked into the ballroom in the elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as unconcernedly and simply as though all the rosettes and lace all the minute details of her attire had not cost her or her family a attention as though she had been born in this tulle and lace with this towering coiffure surmounted by a rose and two small leaves 
 when just before entering the ballroom the old princess tried to adjust a sash ribbon that had become twisted kitty had drawn back a little she felt that everything must be right of itself and graceful and that nothing could need setting straight 
 
 kitty had one of her good days her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere her lace bertha did not droop anywhere her rosettes were neither crushed nor torn off her pink slippers with high curving heels did not pinch but gladdened her tiny feet and the thick bandeaux of fair hair kept up on her head all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines the black velvet ribbon of her locket nestled with special tenderness round her neck this velvet ribbon was a darling at home regarding her neck in the looking glass kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet ribbon was a darling kitty smiled here too at the ball when she glanced at it in the glass her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sensation of chill marble a sensation she particularly liked her eyes sparkled and her rosy lips could not help but smile from the consciousness of their own attractiveness she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies waiting to be asked to dance kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz and asked by the best partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned conductor of the dances and master of ceremonies married man handsome and well built iegorushka korsunsky he had only just left the countess banina with whom he had danced the first turn of the waltz and scanning his demesne that is to say a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of kitty entering and flew up to her with that peculiar easy amble which is confined to conductors of the dances bowing and without even asking her if she cared to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she looked round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smiling to her took it 
 how good of you to come in good time he said to her embracing her waist such a bad habit to be late 
 bending her left arm she laid it on his shoulder and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly lightly and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music 
 a rest to waltz with you he said to her as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz charming such lightness precision he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well 
 she smiled at his praise and continued to look about the room over his shoulder she was not like a girl at her first ball for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome but she was in the middle stage between these two she was excited and at the same time she had sufficient to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the very flower of society grouped together there impossibly naked was the beauty liddy wife there was the lady of the house there shone the bald pate of krivin always to be found wherever the best people were in that direction gazed the young men not venturing to approach there too she descried stiva and there she saw the charming figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown and he was there kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin with her farsighted eyes knew him at once and was even aware that he was looking at her 
 another turn eh not tired said korsunsky a little out of breath 
 no thank you 
 where shall i take you 
 madame here i think take me to her 
 wherever you command 
 and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight toward the group in the left corner continually saying pardon mesdames pardon pardon mesdames and steering his course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarranging a feather he turned his partner sharply round so that her slim ankles in light transparent stockings were exposed to view and her train floated out in fan shape and covered knees korsunsky bowed set straight his open shirt front and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna kitty flushed took her train from knees and a little giddy looked round seeking anna anna was not in lilac as kitty had so urgently wished but in a black velvet gown showing her full shoulders and bosom that looked as though carved in old ivory and her rounded arms with tiny slender hands the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair her own with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies and a similar one on the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure was not striking all that was noticeable was the little willful tendrils of her curly hair that persisted in escaping on the nape of her neck and on her temples encircling her sculptured strong neck was a thread of pearls 
 kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was precisely in that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and animated 
 she was standing as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned toward him 
 no i cast a stone she was saying in answer to something though i understand it she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward kitty with a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks you came into the room dancing she added 
 this is one of my most faithful supporters said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen the princess helps to make any ball festive and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz he said bending down to her 
 why have you met inquired their host 
 is there anyone we have not met my wife and i are like white wolves everyone knows us answered korsunsky a waltz anna arkadyevna 
 i dance whenever possible not to she said 
 but tonight impossible answered korsunsky 
 during the conversation vronsky was approaching them 
 well since impossible tonight let us start she said not noticing bow and hastily put her hand on shoulder 
 what is she vexed with him about thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret at not having seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing as she listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterward for several years this look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame 
 pardon pardon waltz waltz shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing

 kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was precisely in that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and animated 
 she was standing as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned toward him 
 no i cast a stone she was saying in answer to something though i understand it she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward kitty with a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks you came into the room dancing she added 
 this is one of my most faithful supporters said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen the princess helps to make any ball festive and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz he said bending down to her 
 why have you met inquired their host 
 is there anyone we have not met my wife and i are like white wolves everyone knows us answered korsunsky a waltz anna arkadyevna 
 i dance whenever possible not to she said 
 but tonight impossible answered korsunsky 
 during the conversation vronsky was approaching them 
 well since impossible tonight let us start she said not noticing bow and hastily put her hand on shoulder 
 what is she vexed with him about thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret at not having seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing as she listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterward for several years this look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame 
 pardon pardon waltz waltz shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing

 vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordstone when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future popular theater and only once did the conversation touch her to the quick when he asked her whether levin were here and added that he liked him very much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a sinking heart to the mazurka she fancied that the mazurka would decide everything the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance it with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna since the beginning of the evening and now she again suddenly saw her as quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously curving her lips and the distinct grace precision and lightness of her movements 
 who is it she asked herself all or one and without keeping up her end of the conversation the thread of which the harassed young man she was dancing with lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chaine and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart no not admiration of the crowd that has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips she seemed to make an effort to control herself in order not to show these signs of delight but they appeared on her face of themselves but what of him kitty looked at him and was horrified what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of face she saw in him what had become of his always calm firm manner and the carelessly calm expression of his face now every time he turned to her he bent his head as though he would have fallen at her feet and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread i would not offend you his eyes seemed to be saying each time but i want to save myself and i know how on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before 
 they were speaking of common acquaintances keeping up the smallest of small talk but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers and strangely enough although they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovich was with his french and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match these words were yet fraught with significance for them and they sensed this as much as kitty did the whole ball the whole world everything seemed screened by a fog within soul nothing but the stern discipline of her supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her that is to dance to answer questions to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners and now she was not dancing the mazurka she had not even a hope of being asked for it because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home yet she had not the strength to do this she felt crushed 
 she went to the farthest end of the second drawing room and sank into a low chair her light transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hanging listlessly was lost in the folds of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan and with rapid short strokes fanned her burning face yet while she looked like a butterfly clinging to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight her heart ached with a horrible despair 
 but perhaps i am wrong perhaps it was not so and again she recalled all she had seen 
 kitty what is it said countess nordstone stepping noiselessly over the carpet toward her i understand it 
 lower lip began to quiver she got up quickly 
 kitty not dancing the mazurka 
 no no said kitty in a voice shaking with tears 
 he asked her for the mazurka in my presence said countess nordstone knowing kitty would understand who he and her were she said why you going to dance it with princess shcherbatskaia 
 oh it matter to me answered kitty 
 no one but she herself understood her position no one knew that she had refused yesterday the man whom perhaps she loved and refused him because she had put her faith in another 
 countess nordstone found korsunsky with whom she was to dance the mazurka and told him to ask kitty 
 kitty danced in the first couple and luckily for her she had not to talk because korsunsky was all the time running about overseeing his demesne vronsky and anna were sitting almost opposite her she saw them with her farsighted eyes and saw them too close by when they met in the figures and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was consummated she saw that they felt themselves alone in this crowded room and on face always so firm and independent she saw the look that had struck her of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong 
 anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew eyes to face she was charming in her simple black dress charming were her round arms with their bracelets charming was her firm neck with its thread of pearls charming the straying curls of her loose hair charming the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands charming was that lovely face in its animation yet there was something terrible and cruel in her charm 
 kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute did her suffering grow kitty felt crushed and her face showed it when vronsky caught sight of her coming upon her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her so changed was she 
 delightful ball he said to her merely for the sake of saying something 
 yes she answered 
 in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned kitty and another lady kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady 
 yes there is something uncanny devilish and charming about her said kitty to herself 
 anna did not want to stay for supper but the master of the house began urging her 
 nonsense anna arkadyevna said korsunsky placing her bare hand upon his coat sleeve such an idea for a cotillon un bijou 
 and he moved gradually on trying to draw her along with him their host smiled approvingly 
 no not going to stay answered anna smiling but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay 
 no why as it is i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in peterburg said anna looking round at vronsky who stood near her i must rest a little before my journey 
 are you definitely going tomorrow then asked vronsky 
 yes i suppose so answered anna as though wondering at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it 
 anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper but went home

 yes there must be something disgusting repulsive about me reflected levin as he left the and set out on foot for his lodgings and i get on with other people pride they say no i even pride if i had any pride i should not have put myself in such a position and he pictured to himself vronsky happy clever and calm certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening yes she was bound to choose him it must be so and i cannot complain of anyone or anything i am myself to blame what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine who am i and what am i a nobody not wanted by anyone nor of use to anybody and he recalled his brother nikolai and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him he right in saying that everything in the world is bad and vile and are we fair in our judgment present and past of brother nikolai of course from the point of view of procophii seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy a despicable person but i know him differently i know his soul and know that we are alike and i instead of going to seek him out went out to dinner and then came here levin walked up to a lamppost read his address which was in his pocketbook and called a cabby all the long way to his levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother life he remembered how his brother while at the university and for a year afterward had in spite of the jeers of his companions lived like a monk strictly observing all religious rites services and fasts and avoiding every sort of pleasure especially women and now afterward he had all at once broken out had associated with the most horrible people and rushed into the most senseless debauchery he remembered later the scandal over a boy whom he had taken from the country to bring up and in a fit of rage had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for personal injury then he remembered the scandal with a sharper to whom he had lost money and given a promissory note and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint asserting that he had cheated him this was the money sergei ivanovich had paid then he remembered how he had spent a night in a police station for disorderly conduct in the street he remembered the shameful proceedings he had instituted against his brother sergei ivanovich accusing him of not having paid him apparently his share of his estate and the last scandal when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder it was all horribly vile yet to levin it appeared not at all as vile as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolai did not know all his story did not know his heart 
 levin remembered that when nikolai had been in the devout stage the period of fasts and monks and church services when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament everyone far from encouraging him had jeered at him and levin had too with the others they had teased him calling him noah and monk yet when he had broken out no one had helped him but had all turned away from him with horror and loathing 
 levin felt that brother nikolai in spite of all the ugliness of his life in his soul in the very depths of his soul was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled character and some pressure upon his intellect for he had always wanted to be good i will tell him everything without reserve and i will make him speak without reserve too and show him that i love him and therefore understand him levin resolved to himself as toward eleven he reached the hotel of which he had the address 
 at the top twelve and thirteen the porter answered inquiry 
 at home 
 probably he is at home 
 the door of no was half open and together with a streak of light there issued thick fumes of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he knew at once that his brother was there he recognized his cough 
 as he went in at the door the unknown voice was saying 
 it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the done 
 konstantin levin looked in at the door and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair wearing a russian coat and that a young woman in a woollen gown without collar or cuffs was sitting on the sofa his brother was not to be seen konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life no one had heard him and konstantin taking off his galoshes listened to what the gentleman in the russian coat was saying he was speaking of some enterprise 
 well the devil flay them these privileged classes his voice responded with a cough masha get us some supper and serve up some wine if any left or else send for some 
 the woman rose came out from behind the partition and saw konstantin 
 some gentleman here nikolai dmitrievich she said 
 whom do you want said the voice of nikolai levin angrily 
 i answered konstantin levin coming forward into the light 
 i voice said again still more angrily he could be heard getting up hurriedly stumbling against something and levin saw facing him in the doorway the big scared eyes and the huge gaunt stooping figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its oddity and sickliness 
 he was even thinner than three years before when konstantin levin had seen him last he was wearing a short coat and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever his hair had grown thinner the same straight mustache hid his lips the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor 
 ah kostia he exclaimed suddenly recognizing his brother and his eyes lighted up with joy but the same second he looked round at the young man and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well as if his cravat were choking him and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rested on his emaciated face 
 i wrote to you and sergei ivanovich both that i know you and want to know you what is it you want 
 he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him the worst and most oppressive part of his character which made all relations with him so difficult had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him and now when he saw his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remembered it all 
 i want to see you for anything he answered timidly simply come to see you 
 his timidity obviously softened nikolai his lips twitched 
 oh so it he said well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this is he said addressing his brother and indicating the gentleman in the russian coat this is mr kritsky a friend of my kiev days a very remarkable man persecuted by the police of course since not a scoundrel 
 and he surveyed as it was a habit of his everyone in the room seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was starting to go he shouted to her wait a minute i said and with that inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin knew so well he began with another look round at everyone to tell story to his brother how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benevolent society for the poor students and classes on sunday and how he had afterward been a teacher in a rural school and had been driven out of that too and had afterward been on trial for something or other 
 of the kiev university said konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that followed 
 yes i was in kiev kritsky replied angrily his face darkening 
 and this woman nikolai levin interrupted him pointing to her is my lifemate marya nikolaevna i took her out of a dive and he jerked his neck as he said it but i love her and respect her and anyone who wants to know me he added raising his voice and knitting his brows is requested to love her and respect her precisely the same as a wife to me precisely so now you know whom got to do with and if you think lowering yourself well the door and god speed thee 
 and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them 
 but how will i lower myself i understand

 chapter 
 
 so you see pursued nikolai levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching 
 it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do 
 here do you see he pointed to some sort of short iron bars fastened together with twine lying in a corner of the room do you see that the beginning of a new enterprise going into this enterprise will be an industrial association 
 konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from nikolai levin went on talking 
 you know that capital oppresses the worker our workers the mouzhiks bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that no matter how much they work they escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society is so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed he finished up and looked questioningly at his brother 
 yes of course said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his projecting cheekbones 
 and so founding a association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production everything will be in common 
 where is the association to be asked konstantin levin 
 in the village of vozdrem government of kazan 
 but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a association in a village 
 why because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were and why you and sergei ivanovich like people to try and get them out of their slavery said nikolai levin exasperated by the objection 
 konstantin levin sighed looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolai still more 
 i know sergei and your aristocratic views i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils 
 i say why do you talk of sergei ivanovich levin let drop smiling 
 sergei ivanovich tell you why nikolai levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergei ivanovich tell you why but the use of talking only one thing what did you come to me for you look down on all this very well then but go away in name go away he shrieked getting up from his chair go away go away 
 i look down on it at all said konstantin levin timidly i even dispute it 
 at that instant marya nikolaevna came back nikolai levin looked round angrily at her she went quickly to him and whispered something 
 not well grown irritable said nikolai levin getting calmer and breathing painfully and then you talk to me of sergei ivanovich and his essay such rubbish such lying such what can a man write about justice who knows nothing of it have you read his essay he turned to kritsky sitting down again at the table and clearing a space for himself by pushing back some cigarettes 
 i kritsky responded gloomily obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation 
 why not said nikolai levin now turning with exasperation upon kritsky 
 because i see the use of wasting my time over it 
 oh if you please how did you know it would be wasting your time that too deep for many people that is to say over their heads but different with me i see through his ideas and i know wherein the weakness lies 
 they all fell silent kritsky got up sluggishly and reached for his cap 
 you have supper all right come round tomorrow with the locksmith 
 kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolai levin smiled and winked 
 he too is poor stuff he said for i can see 
 but at that instant kritsky at the door called him 
 what do you want now he said and went out to him in the passage left alone with marya nikolaevna levin turned to her 
 have you been long with my brother he said to her

 so you see pursued nikolai levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching 
 it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do 
 here do you see he pointed to some sort of short iron bars fastened together with twine lying in a corner of the room do you see that the beginning of a new enterprise going into this enterprise will be an industrial association 
 konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from nikolai levin went on talking 
 you know that capital oppresses the worker our workers the mouzhiks bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that no matter how much they work they escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society is so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed he finished up and looked questioningly at his brother 
 yes of course said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his projecting cheekbones 
 and so founding a association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production everything will be in common 
 where is the association to be asked konstantin levin 
 in the village of vozdrem government of kazan 
 but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a association in a village 
 why because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were and why you and sergei ivanovich like people to try and get them out of their slavery said nikolai levin exasperated by the objection 
 konstantin levin sighed looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolai still more 
 i know sergei and your aristocratic views i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils 
 i say why do you talk of sergei ivanovich levin let drop smiling 
 sergei ivanovich tell you why nikolai levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergei ivanovich tell you why but the use of talking only one thing what did you come to me for you look down on all this very well then but go away in name go away he shrieked getting up from his chair go away go away 
 i look down on it at all said konstantin levin timidly i even dispute it 
 at that instant marya nikolaevna came back nikolai levin looked round angrily at her she went quickly to him and whispered something 
 not well grown irritable said nikolai levin getting calmer and breathing painfully and then you talk to me of sergei ivanovich and his essay such rubbish such lying such what can a man write about justice who knows nothing of it have you read his essay he turned to kritsky sitting down again at the table and clearing a space for himself by pushing back some cigarettes 
 i kritsky responded gloomily obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation 
 why not said nikolai levin now turning with exasperation upon kritsky 
 because i see the use of wasting my time over it 
 oh if you please how did you know it would be wasting your time that too deep for many people that is to say over their heads but different with me i see through his ideas and i know wherein the weakness lies 
 they all fell silent kritsky got up sluggishly and reached for his cap 
 you have supper all right come round tomorrow with the locksmith 
 kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolai levin smiled and winked 
 he too is poor stuff he said for i can see 
 but at that instant kritsky at the door called him

 chapter 
 
 in the morning konstantin levin left moscow and toward evening he reached home on the journey in the train he talked to his fellow travelers about politics and the new railways and just as in moscow he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas by dissatisfaction with himself and shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station when he saw his coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turned up when in the dim light falling through the station windows he saw his own carpeted sledge his own horses with their tails up in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage told him the village news that the contractor had arrived and that pava had calved he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up and the shame and were passing away he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses but he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light when he had put on the sheepskin coat brought for him and all muffled up had taken his seat in the sleigh and started off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village and staring at the off horse that had been formerly his saddle horse overridden but a spirited animal from the don he felt himself and did not want to be anyone else all he wanted now was to be better than before in the first place he resolved that from that day on he would give up hoping for the extraordinary happiness which the marriage was to afford him and consequently he would not disdain the present so in the second place he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to propose then remembering his brother nikolai he resolved that he would never allow himself to forget him that he would watch him and not lose sight of him so as to be ready to help should things go ill with him and that would be soon he felt then too his talk of communism which he had treated so lightly at the time now made him reflect he considered an alteration in economic conditions nonsense yet he had always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the common folk and he now determined that in order to feel quite in the right though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before he would now work still harder and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in most pleasant reveries with a lively feeling of hope in a new better life he drove up to his house about nine at night 
 the snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by light falling from the windows in the room of his old nurse agathya mikhailovna who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house she was not yet asleep kouzma awakened by her sleepy and barefooted ran out onto the steps a setter bitch laska leaped out too almost upsetting kouzma and whining rubbed against knees jumping up and longing yet not daring to put her forepaws on his chest

 the house was big and and levin though he lived alone heated and used the whole house he knew that this was stupid he knew that it was even wrong and contrary to his present new plans but this house was a whole world to levin it was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died they had lived just the life that to levin seemed the ideal of perfection and that he had dreamed of renewing with his wife with his family 
 levin scarcely remembered his mother his conception of her was for him a sacred memory and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been 
 he was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family his ideas of marriage were consequently quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances for whom getting married was merely one of the many affairs of everyday life for levin it was the chief affair of life on which its whole happiness turned and now he had to give up that

 stepan arkadyevich was not dining at home but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven 
 kitty too did not come sending a note that she had a headache dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess whether it was because children are fickle or because they have acute senses and they felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her that she was not now interested in them they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt and their love for her and were quite indifferent to her leaving anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances jotted down her accounts and packed altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind but in that worried mood which dolly knew so well in her own case and which does not come without cause and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with oneself after dinner anna went up to her room to dress and dolly followed her 
 how queer you are today dolly said to her 
 i do you think so not queer but nasty i am like that sometimes i keep feeling as if i could cry very stupid but pass off said anna quickly and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs her eyes were particularly bright and were continually dimmed with tears in the same way i want to leave peterburg and now i want to go away from here 
 you came here and did a good deed said dolly looking intently at her 
 eyes were wet with tears as she looked at her 
 say that dolly done nothing and could do nothing i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me what have i done and what could i do in your heart there was found love enough to forgive 
 if it had not been for you god knows what would have happened how happy you are anna said dolly everything is clear and good in your heart 
 every heart has its own skeleton as the english say 
 you have no sort of skeleton have you everything is so clear in you 
 i have said anna suddenly and unexpectedly after her tears a sly mocking smile puckered her lips 
 come amusing anyway your skeleton and not depressing said dolly smiling 
 no he is depressing do you know why going today instead of tomorrow this is a confession that weighs on me i want to make you its recipient said anna resolutely letting herself drop into an armchair and looking straight into face 
 and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears up to the curly black ringlets on her neck 
 yes anna went on do you know why kitty come to dinner jealous of me i have spoiled been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure but truly truly not my fault or only my fault a little bit she said daintily drawling the words a little bit 
 oh how like stiva you said that said dolly laughing 
 anna was hurt 
 oh no oh no not stiva she said knitting her brows why telling you just because i do not even for an instant permit myself to doubt about myself said anna 
 but at the very moment she was uttering the words she felt that they were not true she was not merely doubting about herself she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky and was going away sooner than she had meant solely to avoid meeting him 
 yes stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him and that he 
 you imagine how absurdly it all came about i only meant to be matchmaking and all at once it turned out quite differently possibly against my own will 
 she flushed and stopped 
 oh they feel it immediately said dolly 
 but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side anna interrupted her and certain it will all be forgotten and kitty will leave off hating me 
 all the same anna to tell you the truth not very anxious for this marriage for kitty and better it should come to nothing if he vronsky is capable of falling in love with you in a single day 
 oh heavens that would be too silly said anna and again a deep flush of pleasure appeared on her face as she heard the idea that absorbed her put into words and so here i am going away having made an enemy of kitty whom i liked so much ah how sweet she is but make it right dolly eh 
 dolly could scarcely suppress a smile she loved anna but she was pleased to see that she too had her weaknesses 
 an enemy that be 
 i did so want you all to care for me as i do for you and now i care for you more than ever said anna with tears in her eyes ah how silly i am today 
 she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing 
 at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevich arrived late rosy and smelling of wine and cigars 
 emotionalism infected dolly and when she embraced her for the last time she whispered 
 remember anna what done for me i shall never forget and remember that i love you and shall always love you as my dearest friend

 chapter 
 
 now all over god be praised was the first thought that came to anna arkadyevna when she had said for the last time to her brother who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang she sat down on her lounge beside annushka and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping carriage thank god tomorrow i shall see seriozha and alexei alexandrovich and my life good and familiar will go on in the old way 
 still in the same anxious frame of mind in which she had been all that day anna took a meticulous pleasure in making herself comfortable for the journey with her tiny deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag took out a cushion laid it on her knees and carefully wrapping up her feet settled herself comfortably an invalid lady had already lain down to sleep two other ladies began talking to anna and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet and made observations about the heating of the train anna answered the ladies in a few words but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation she asked annushka to get a small lantern hooked it on the arm of her seat and took from her bag a paper knife and an english novel at first she could not get interested in her reading the fuss and stir were disturbing then when the train had started she could not help listening to the noises then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane and the sight of the muffled guard passing by covered with snow on one side and the conversations about the terrible blizzard raging outside distracted her attention and after that everything was the same and the same the same jouncing and rattling the same snow lashing the window the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold and back again to heat the same flitting of the same faces in the and the same voices and then anna began to read and to grasp what she read annushka was already dozing the red bag on her lap clutched by her broad hands in gloves of which one was torn anna arkadyevna read and grasped the sense yet it was annoying to her to read that is to follow the reflection of other lives she had too great a desire to live herself if she read that the heroine of the novel were nursing a sick man she longed to move with noiseless steps about his sickroom if she read of a member of parliament delivering a speech she longed to deliver it if she read of how lady mary had ridden after the hounds and had provoked her and had surprised everyone by her daring she too longed to be doing the same but there was no chance of doing anything and her little hands toying with the smooth paper knife she forced herself to read 
 the hero of the novel was already beginning to attain his english happiness a baronetcy and an estate and anna was feeling a desire to go with him to his estate when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed and that she was ashamed of the same thing but what was it he was ashamed of what have i to be ashamed of she asked herself in injured surprise she abandoned the book and sank against the back of her chair tightly gripping the paper knife in both hands there was nothing to be ashamed of she went over all her moscow recollections all were fine pleasant she recalled the ball recalled vronsky and his enamored submissive face she recalled all her conduct with him there was nothing shameful yet with all that at this very point in her reminiscences the feeling of shame was intensified as though some inner voice precisely here when she recalled vronsky were saying to her warm very warm hot well what is it she said to herself resolutely shifting on her seat what does it mean am i afraid to look at this without blinking well what is it can it be that between me and this there exist or can exist any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance she laughed contemptuously and took up her book again but now she was absolutely unable to make sense of what she read she passed the paper knife over the windowpane then laid its smooth cool surface to her cheek and almost laughed aloud at the unreasoning joy that all at once possessed her she felt that her nerves like strings were being tautened more and more upon some kind of tightening peg she felt her eyes opening wider and wider her fingers and toes twitching nervously something within stopping her breathing while all images and sounds seemed in the swaying to strike her with extraordinary vividness moments of doubt were continually besetting her was the car going forward or back or was it standing absolutely still was it really annushka at her side or a stranger that on the arm of the chair a fur cloak or some beast and what am i myself is it i or some other woman she was afraid of yielding to this trance but something was drawing her into it and at will she could yield to it or resist it she got up to rouse herself and slipped off her plaid and the cape of warm dress for a moment she regained her and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long nankeen overcoat with a button missing from it was the fireman that he was looking at the thermometer that the wind and snow had burst in after him through the door but then everything grew confused again that peasant with the long waist took to gnawing something within the wall the little crone started stretching her legs the whole length of the car and filled it with a black cloud then there was a dreadful screeching and banging as though someone were being rent into pieces then a red blaze blinded her eyes and at last everything was screened by a wall anna felt that she had plunged downward yet all this was not terrible but joyful the voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her very ear she arose and came to realizing that they had come to a station and that this was the conductor she requested annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl put them on and went toward the door 
 do you wish to get out asked annushka 
 yes i want to get a breath of air very hot in here 
 and she opened the door the blizzard and the wind rushed to meet her and began to contend with her for the door and even this seemed joyful to her she opened the door and stepped out this seemed to be all that the wind had been lying in wait for it set up a gleeful whistle and was about to snatch her up and whirl her away but she clutched the cold doorpost and holding on to her shawl descended to the platform and the shelter of the car the wind had been mighty on the steps but on the platform in the lee of the train there was a lull with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the snowy frosty air and standing near the car looked about the platform and the lighted station

 the frightful storm raged and whistled between the wheels of the cars along the posts around the corner of the station the cars posts people everything in sight were covered with snow on one side and were getting more and more snowed under for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would again swoop down with such gusts that it seemed impossible to withstand it meanwhile some men or other were dashing about gaily talking to one another making the boards of the platform creak and ceaselessly opening and shutting the big doors a stooping human shadow glided by at her feet and she heard a hammer tapping upon iron have the telegram came an angry voice out of the stormy murk on the other side this way no other voices were also shouting and muffled figures scurried by plastered with snow two gentlemen passed by her cigarettes glowing in their mouths she drew in one more deep breath and had just taken her hand out of her muff to grasp the doorpost and enter the car when still another man in a military overcoat quite close beside her stepped between her and the flickering light of a lantern she looked round and the same instant recognized face putting his hand to the peak of his cap he bowed to her and asked if there anything she wanted whether he could not be of some service to her she gazed rather long at him without any answer and in spite of the shadow in which he was standing she saw or fancied she saw the expression both of his face and his eyes it was again that expression of reverent rapture which had affected her so yesterday more than once she had told herself during the past few days and only just now that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men forever exactly the same that one meets everywhere that she would never permit herself even to think of him yet now at the first flush of meeting him she was seized by an emotion of joyous pride she had no need to ask why he was here she knew as surely as if he had told her that he was here only to be where she was 
 i know you were going and why are you going she said letting fall the hand which had grasped the doorpost and irrepressible joy and animation shone in her face 
 why am i going he repeated looking straight into her eyes you know that i am going to be where you are he said i cannot do otherwise 
 and at this very point as though it had overcome all obstacles the wind scattered the snow from the car roofs and began to flutter some sheet of iron it had torn off while the whistle of the engine set up a roar in front dismal and lamenting all the awesomeness of the blizzard now seemed still more splendid to her he had uttered precisely what her soul yearned for but which her reason dreaded she made no answer and in her face he beheld a struggle 
 forgive me if what i have said displeases you he said humbly 
 he had spoken courteously deferentially yet so firmly so obdurately that for long she could find no answer 
 what you say is wrong and i beg of you if you are a good man to forget what you have said even as i shall forget it she said at last 
 not a single word of yours nor a single gesture shall i ever forget nor could i forget 
 enough enough she cried vainly attempting to give a stern expression to her face which he was avidly scrutinizing clutching at the cold doorpost she clambered up the steps and quickly entered the corridor of the car but in this little corridor she paused reviewing in her imagination all that had occurred without recalling her own words or his she realized instinctively that that conversation had brought them fearfully closer and she was both frightened and made happy thereby after standing thus a few seconds she went into the car and sat down in her place that tensed state which had tormented her at first was not only renewed but grew greater and reached such a pitch that she was afraid that at any moment something would snap within her from the excessive tension she did not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the reveries that filled her imagination there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy on the contrary there was something joyous glowing and exhilarating toward morning anna dozed off as she sat and when she awoke it was already light and the train was nearing peterburg at once thoughts of home of her husband and son and the details of the day ahead and days to follow came thronging upon her 
 at peterburg as soon as the train stopped and she got out the first face that attracted her attention was that of her husband oh my god what has happened to his ears she thought looking at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ears that struck her so now as they propped up the brim of his round hat catching sight of her he went to meet her pursing his lips into their habitual mocking smile and fixing her with his big tired eyes some unpleasant sensation contracted her heart as she met his obdurate and tired glance as though she had expected to see him a different man she was particularly struck by that feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced on meeting him this was an intimate familiar feeling like that state of dissimulation which she experienced in her relations with her husband but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling now she was clearly and painfully aware of it 
 yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as he was during the second year after marriage was consumed by the desire of seeing you he said in his dilatory voice and in that tone which he almost always used to her a tone of bantering at anyone who should speak thus in earnest 
 is seriozha quite well she asked 
 and is this all the reward said he for my ardor well quite well

 i know you were going and why are you going she said letting fall the hand which had grasped the doorpost and irrepressible joy and animation shone in her face 
 why am i going he repeated looking straight into her eyes you know that i am going to be where you are he said i cannot do otherwise 
 and at this very point as though it had overcome all obstacles the wind scattered the snow from the car roofs and began to flutter some sheet of iron it had torn off while the whistle of the engine set up a roar in front dismal and lamenting all the awesomeness of the blizzard now seemed still more splendid to her he had uttered precisely what her soul yearned for but which her reason dreaded she made no answer and in her face he beheld a struggle 
 forgive me if what i have said displeases you he said humbly 
 he had spoken courteously deferentially yet so firmly so obdurately that for long she could find no answer 
 what you say is wrong and i beg of you if you are a good man to forget what you have said even as i shall forget it she said at last 
 not a single word of yours nor a single gesture shall i ever forget nor could i forget 
 enough enough she cried vainly attempting to give a stern expression to her face which he was avidly scrutinizing clutching at the cold doorpost she clambered up the steps and quickly entered the corridor of the car but in this little corridor she paused reviewing in her imagination all that had occurred without recalling her own words or his she realized instinctively that that conversation had brought them fearfully closer and she was both frightened and made happy thereby after standing thus a few seconds she went into the car and sat down in her place that tensed state which had tormented her at first was not only renewed but grew greater and reached such a pitch that she was afraid that at any moment something would snap within her from the excessive tension she did not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the reveries that filled her imagination there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy on the contrary there was something joyous glowing and exhilarating toward morning anna dozed off as she sat and when she awoke it was already light and the train was nearing peterburg at once thoughts of home of her husband and son and the details of the day ahead and days to follow came thronging upon her 
 at peterburg as soon as the train stopped and she got out the first face that attracted her attention was that of her husband oh my god what has happened to his ears she thought looking at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ears that struck her so now as they propped up the brim of his round hat catching sight of her he went to meet her pursing his lips into their habitual mocking smile and fixing her with his big tired eyes some unpleasant sensation contracted her heart as she met his obdurate and tired glance as though she had expected to see him a different man she was particularly struck by that feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced on meeting him this was an intimate familiar feeling like that state of dissimulation which she experienced in her relations with her husband but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling now she was clearly and painfully aware of it 
 yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as he was during the second year after marriage was consumed by the desire of seeing you he said in his dilatory voice and in that tone which he almost always used to her a tone of bantering at anyone who should speak thus in earnest 
 is seriozha quite well she asked 
 and is this all the reward said he for my ardor well quite well

 chapter 
 
 vronsky had not even attempted to fall asleep all that night he sat in his armchair his eyes fixed before him or scanning the people who got in and out and if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and aroused people who did not know him by his air of unshakable calmness he now seemed prouder and more than ever he regarded people as if they were things a nervous young man a clerk in a law court who had the seat opposite his conceived a hatred for him because of this air the young man asked him for a light and entered into conversation with him and even jostled him to make him feel that he was not a thing but a man but vronsky kept on regarding him as if he were a lamppost and the young man grimaced feeling that he was losing his under the oppressiveness of this refusal to recognize him as a human being 
 vronsky saw nothing and no one he felt himself a king not because he believed that he had made any impression on anna he did not yet believe that but because the impression she had made on him afforded him happiness and pride 
 what would come of it all he did not know or even think he felt that all his forces hitherto dissolute scattered were centered on one thing and bent with fearful energy toward one blissful goal and therein lay his happiness he did but know that he had told her the truth that he had come where she was that all the happiness of life the sole meaning in life for him now lay in seeing her and hearing her voice and when he got out of his car at bologovo to get some seltzer water and had caught sight of anna his very first word had involuntarily told her his very thoughts and he was glad he had told her that she knew now and was thinking of it he did not sleep all night back in his compartment he incessantly kept ruminating upon every posture in which he had seen her every word she had uttered and in his imagination making his heart swoon floated pictures of a possible future 
 when he got out of the train at peterburg he felt after his sleepless night as lively and fresh as after a cold bath he paused near his car waiting for her to emerge once more he said to himself smiling unconsciously once more i shall see her walk her face she may say something turn her head glance smile perhaps but before he caught sight of her he saw her husband whom the stationmaster was deferentially escorting through the crowd ah yes the husband only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was someone attached to her a husband he had known that she had a husband but had hardly believed in his existence and only now when he saw him did he fully believe in him with his head and shoulders and his legs especially when he saw this husband placidly take her arm with a consciousness of proprietorship 
 seeing alexei alexandrovich with his peterburg face and austerely figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believed in him and was aware of a disagreeable sensation such as might be felt by a man who tortured by thirst finds on reaching a spring a dog a sheep or a pig therein that has not only drunk of it but also muddied the water alexei manner of walking gyrating his whole pelvis and his flat feet was especially offensive to vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same and the sight of her affected him the same way physically reviving him stirring him and filling his soul with happiness he told his german valet who ran up to him from the second class to take his things and go on he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife and noted with a insight the sign of the slight embarrassment with which she spoke to her husband no she does not love him and cannot love him he decided to himself 
 at the very moment that he was approaching anna arkadyevna from the back he noticed with joy that she was conscious of his drawing near and that she looked round after which seeing him she turned again to her husband 
 have you had a good night he said bowing both to her and to her husband and leaving it to alexei alexandrovich to accept the bow on his own account and to return it or not as he might see fit 
 thank you a very good one she answered 
 her face seemed tired and lacking in that play of animation which usually hovered between her smile and her eyes but for a single instant as she glanced at him something flashed in her eyes and although this flash died away at once he was made happy by that moment she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky alexei alexandrovich was regarding vronsky with displeasure trying to recall who he was calmness and had here run up like a scythe against a stone on the frigid of alexei alexandrovich 
 count vronsky said anna 
 ah we are acquainted i believe said alexei alexandrovich apathetically proffering his hand you set out with the mother and return with the son he said to anna articulating distinctly as though each word were a coin of high value bestowed by him on his hearers back from leave i suppose he said and without waiting for a reply he addressed his wife in his bantering tone well were a great many tears shed in moscow at parting 
 by addressing his wife thus he meant vronsky to perceive that he wished to be left alone and turning slightly toward him he touched his hat but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna 
 i hope to have the honor of calling on you he said 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky 
 delighted he said coldly at home mondays then dismissing vronsky entirely he said to his wife i am rather lucky to have just half an hour to meet you so that i can prove to you my fondness he went on in the same bantering tone 
 you lay too great a stress on your fondness for me to value it very much she responded in the same bantering tone involuntarily listening to the sound of steps behind them but what have i to do with that she said to herself and began questioning her husband as to how seriozha had got on without her 
 oh capitally mariette says he has been a very darling boy and i must disappoint you but he has not languished for you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for bestowing a whole day upon me our dear samovar will be enraptured he called the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was bubbling over with excitement on any and every occasion she has been asking for you and know if i may venture to advise you you ought to go to see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares anxious about the reconciliation of the oblonskys 
 the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her and the center of that one of the coteries of the peterburg beau monde with which anna was through her husband in the closest rapport 
 but i wrote to her 
 yes but she must have full details go to see her if not too tired my dear well kondratii will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee once more i shall not be alone at dinner alexei alexandrovich continued but no longer in a jesting tone you believe how grown used to you 
 and with a prolonged pressure of her hand and a particular smile he helped her into her carriage

 chapter 
 
 the first person to meet anna at home was her son he dashed down the stairs to her in spite of the call and with frenzied rapture shrieked mother mother running up to her he hung on her neck 
 i told you it was mother he shouted to the governess i knew it 
 and her son like her husband aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment in her imagination he had been better than he was in reality she had to descend to reality to enjoy him as he was but even so he was charming with his fair curls his blue eyes and his chubby graceful little legs in tightly stockings anna experienced an almost physical delight in the sensation of his nearness and his caresses and a moral reassurance when she met his ingenuous trusting and loving glance and heard his naive questions anna took out the presents children had sent him and told her son about tania a little girl in moscow and how tania could read and even taught the other children 
 why am i not as good as she asked seriozha 
 to me better than anyone else in the whole world 
 i know that said seriozha smiling 
 anna had scarcely drunk her coffee when the countess lidia ivanovna was announced the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall fleshy woman with an unwholesomely yellow complexion and beautiful pensive black eyes anna liked her but today she seemed for the first time to see her with all her shortcomings 
 well my friend were you the bearer of the olive branch asked countess lidia ivanovna the minute she entered the room 
 yes all over but it was not at all as serious as we thought answered anna my is in general much too categorical 
 but countess lidia ivanovna who was interested in everything that did not concern her had a habit of never listening to what interested her she interrupted anna 
 yes plenty of sorrow and evil in the world and i am so fatigued today 
 oh why asked anna trying to repress a smile 
 beginning to weary of vainly breaking lances for the truth and at times altogether unstrung the affair with our dear sisters this was a religiously patriotic philanthropic institution started off splendidly but impossible to do anything with such people added countess lidia ivanovna with a mocking submissiveness to fate they pounced on the idea and mangled it and afterward they thrash it out so pettily and trivially two or three people your husband among them grasp all the significance of this affair but the others merely degrade it yesterday pravdin wrote to me 
 pravdin was a abroad and countess lidia ivanovna told the gist of his letter 
 next the countess spoke of other unpleasantnesses and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches and departed in haste since that day she had to attend the meeting of another society and also a slavonic committee 
 all this is as it has always been but how is it i notice it before anna asked herself or has she been very much irritated today really ludicrous her object is to do good a christian yet forever angry and forever having enemies and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good 
 after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came the wife of a director of the department who told her all the news of the town at three she too went away promising to come to dinner alexei alexandrovich was at the ministry anna left alone spent the time till dinner in lending her presence to her dinner he dined apart from his parents in putting her things in order and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her escritoire 
 the feeling of unreasoning shame which she had felt during the journey and her agitation had completely vanished in the accustomed conditions of her life she again felt herself firm and irreproachable 
 she recalled with wonder her state of mind only yesterday what was it nothing vronsky said something silly which it was easy to put an end to and i answered just as i should have to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and impermissible to speak of it would be to attach importance to that which has none she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost declaration made her in peterburg by a young man a subordinate of her and how alexei alexandrovich had answered that every woman of the world was exposed to this sort of thing but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact and would never permit himself to degrade her and himself by jealousy so then no reason to say anything and thank god there anything to say she told herself
