 what in the world are you going to do now jo asked 
 meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other 
 going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes 
 i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver 
 never take advice keep still all day and not being a pussycat i like to doze by the fire i like adventures and going to find some 
 meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains 
 yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson 
 to lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were one another 
 that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so 
 the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window 
 there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day a shame toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him 
 up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out 
 how do you do are you sick 
 laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven 
 better thank you had a bad cold and been shut up a week 
 sorry what do you amuse yourself with 
 nothing dull as tombs up here 
 you read 
 not much they let me 
 somebody read to you 
 grandpa does sometimes but my books interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time 
 have someone come and see you then 
 there anyone like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak 
 there some nice girl read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse 
 know any 
 you know us began jo then laughed and stopped 
 so i do will you come please cried laurie 
 not quiet and nice but come if mother will let me go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come 
 with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring than a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady 
 all right show her up miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and three kittens in the other 
 here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew laugh at them but i refuse she was so anxious to do something 
 it so happened that funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once 
 that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blancmange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of pet geranium 
 it anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cozy room this is 
 it might be it it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i know how to make them mind it worries me though 
 right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed the things made straight on the mantelpiece the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then fixed 
 and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully 
 how kind you are yes what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company 
 no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by 
 thank you read all those and if you mind rather talk answered laurie 
 not a bit talk all day if only set me going beth says i never know when to stop 
 is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest 
 yes beth my girl and a regular good one she is too 
 the pretty one is meg and the one is amy i believe 
 laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when alone up here i help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i help watching it i got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control 
 the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said 
 never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping come over and see us mother is so splendid do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and have jolly times your grandpa let you 
 i think he would if your mother asked him very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more 
 we are not strangers we are neighbors and you think be a bother we want to know you and been trying to do it this ever so long we been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you 
 you see grandpa lives among his books and mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can 
 bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then have plenty of friends andpleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it last long if you keep going 
 laurie turned red again but offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant 
 do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased 
 go to school a i mean i go to wait on my and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo 
 laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it manners to make too many inquiries into affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable 
 jo liked his good breeding and mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled 
 laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter 
 oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment 
 much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself 
 if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you be afraid said laurie getting up 
 not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head 
 i believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met hem in some of his moods 
 the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it 
 what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the added impressively 
 a fellow live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite 
 before he could more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me your grandpa 
 well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked 
 i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i know why i should be marmee said i might come and i think any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door 
 a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i bear to stop said laurie gratefully 
 the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke 
 would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie 
 mind me happy as a cricket here answered jo 
 laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly sure now that i be afraid of him for got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of hisown he as handsome as my grandfather but i like him 
 thank you said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence 
 poor jo blushed till she blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so not afraid of me hey 
 not much sir 
 and you think me as handsome as your grandfather 
 not quite sir 
 and got a tremendous will have i 
 i only said i thought so 
 but you like me in spite of it 
 yes i do sir 
 that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod got your spirit if you his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend 
 thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly 
 what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put 
 only trying to be neighborly sir and jo to how her visit came about 
 you think he needs cheering up a bit do you 
 yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly 
 tut tut tut that was the affair how is the poor woman 
 doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were 
 just her way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so the tea bell we have it early on the account come down and go on being neighborly 
 if like to have me sir 
 ask you if i and mr laurence offered her his arm with courtesy 
 what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home 
 hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather 
 i know come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance 
 evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo 
 the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh 
 right the lad is lonely see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself 
 if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much 
 they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room by attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open 
 do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression 
 sometimes he answered modestly 
 please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth 
 you first 
 know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly 
 so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue 
 that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well much obliged to you and i hope come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo 
 he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head 
 no it was me he like to hear me play 
 why not 
 tell you some day john is going home with you as i 
 no need of that i am not a young lady and only a step take care of yourself you 
 yes but you will come again i hope 
 if you promise to come and see us after you are well 
 i will 
 good night laurie 
 good night jo good night 
 when all the adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues 
 mother why mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition 
 i am not sure but i think it was because his son father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said 
 dear me how romantic exclaimed meg 
 how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go 
 why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental 
 what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental 
 i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him 
 he meant the blanc mange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course 
 did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before 
 i never saw such a girl you know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter 
 i think they are great nonsense and thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun a nice boy and i like him and i have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish all be good to him because he got any mother and he may come over and see us he marmee 
 yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can 
 i call myself a child and not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth 
 i was thinking about our progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful 
 we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect

 the mummy 
 part 
 
 int scarab chamber day 
 the warden crawls into a dark chamber and lights a torch 
 a mural wall comes alive embedded into it are dozens of 
 black amethyst scarabs glittering images of the sacred 
 beetles awestruck the warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
 starts prying away at one of the precious bugs 
 int anubis chamber day 
 beni and the americans hover around the egyptologist 
 found the secret compartment inside anubis the egyptologist 
 brushes sand away from the seam henderson steps forward and 
 grabs the seam the egyptologist quickly stops him 
 egyptologist 
 seti was no fool 
 henderson sees the intense look in the eyes 
 henderson 
 yeah sure 
 he looks back at the native diggers 
 henderson 
 let him open it 
 the egyptologist nods then yells in egyptian at the diggers 
 the diggers hesitate filled with fear daniels pulls out his gun 
 aims it at three of the diggers the three diggers hesitantly step 
 forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams the other 
 diggers back away scared shitless beni and the americans 
 exchange looks and then they back away as well 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 three heroes are still digging into the ceiling 
 
 lemme get this straight they 
 stuck a sharp red hot poker up 
 your nose cut your brain into 
 small pieces then ripped it 
 all out through your nostrils 
 jonathan 
 owch really got to hurt 
 evelyn 
 called mummification 
 dead when they do this 
 
 jonathan 
 still 
 
 yeah bring you back to life 
 evelyn 
 you two are worse than a couple 
 of schoolboys 
 and when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly gives out 
 grabs evelyn and jerks her clear jonathan dives 
 for the far wall a massive stone casement drops out of the 
 ceiling and crashes to the floor dust flies fills the room 
 int anlibis chamber 
 having heard the crash beni and the americans have their 
 guns pointed at the floor the egyptologist could care less 
 he looks at the diggers gripping their crowbars and yells 
 egyptologist 
 feni 
 the three diggers pull hard the ancient seams start to give 
 the egyptologist yells again the diggers pull harder the 
 compartment starts to loosen again he yells the diggers 
 give one final pull and 
 an intense burst of liquid sprays out of the seam hits the 
 three diggers melts their skin clean off they scream dying 
 horribly half skeletal by the time they hit the ground 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 the dust is starting to clear evelyn and jonathan 
 slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement 
 we immediately recognize it as imhotepis sarcophagus 
 evelyn 
 oh my god it looks like 
 it looks like a sarcophagus 
 
 why would they bury somebody 
 in the ceiling 
 evelyn 
 they they buried him 
 at the foot of anubis he was 
 either someone of great importance 
 or he did something very naughty 
 int scarab chamber day 
 the warden drops an into his pouch then 
 prying away at another it rips off he drops 
 it into his pouch only he misses and this scarab quietly 
 falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing 
 close on the scarab on the floor it begins to transform 
 the amethyst starts to glow something inside starts to 
 wiggle as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon 
 then it splits open and a real live hideous 
 scurries out it races over to the shoe quickly 
 burrows into the leather and vanishes inside 
 the eyes fly open he starts to scream drops his 
 knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg 
 higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
 large hideous lump burrowing under his skin it burrows 
 way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest the 
 warden claws and scratches at it trying to stop it the lump 
 burrows up his neck the warden starts gagging and coughing 
 and then the vanishes into his head 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus 
 revealing a single ominous hieroglyph evelyn stares at it 
 jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid 
 jonathan 
 well who is it 
 evelyn stares at the hieroglyph confused and concerned 
 evelyn 
 he that shall not be named 
 dusts off the huge lock 
 
 some sort of lock here 
 you say these are made 
 of granite with a steel interior 
 evelyn 
 quarried granite with a cobalt lining 
 jonathan

 getting out 
 
 no kiddin without a key

 evelyn

 evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on back 
 evelyn 
 the man on the barge the one 
 with the hook he was looking 
 for a key 
 evelyn pulls out the jonathan tries to take it back 
 jonathan 
 hey mine 
 evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box now 
 shaped exactly like the keyhole evelyn smiles and 
 when they hear the screams echoing through 
 the labyrinth all three of them turn and running 
 int labyrinth day 
 the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the 
 labyrinth totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head 
 evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden 
 starts ripping his own hair out of his head and 
 jonathan grab at the hands but far too crazed 
 he shoves them aside runs full bore down the length of the 
 labyrinth and slams his head straight into a rock wall the 
 warden drops to the ground dead as lead eyes wide open 
 evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring 
 breathing hard themselves 
 ext base camp night 
 evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire 
 evelyn

 misadventure of their own today 
 three of their diggers were killed

 evelyn 
 no i believe if i can see it 
 and i can touch it then

 jonathan opens the pouch the one that held the 
 scarabs he reaches in starts scrounging around we slowly 
 push in waiting for the attack the music builds and then 
 jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the 
 pouch and evelyn both jump 
 
 what what is it 
 jonathan sucks his finger then reaches back into the pouch 
 and pulls out a liquor bottle the top has been chipped off 
 jonathan 
 seagrams 
 jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch inside 
 out and shakes it nothing but sand is inside it 
 jonathan 
 well he may have been a stinky 
 he had good taste 
 jonathan takes a swig and evelyn laugh guiltily 
 and then suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to 
 the sand evelyn and jonathan watch him a beat and then a 
 barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp 
 jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn 
 
 stay here 
 he takes off running through the ruins evelyn immediately 
 gets up and runs after him jonathan grabs a gun holds the 
 bottle of seagrams tight and dashes after her

 exchange looks and then they back away as well 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 three heroes are still digging into the ceiling 
 
 lemme get this straight they 
 stuck a sharp red hot poker up 
 your nose cut your brain into 
 small pieces then ripped it 
 all out through your nostrils 
 jonathan 
 owch really got to hurt 
 evelyn 
 called mummification 
 dead when they do this 
 
 jonathan 
 still 
 
 yeah bring you back to life 
 evelyn 
 you two are worse than a couple 
 of schoolboys 
 and when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly gives out 
 grabs evelyn and jerks her clear jonathan dives 
 for the far wall a massive stone casement drops out of the 
 ceiling and crashes to the floor dust flies fills the room 
 int anlibis chamber 
 having heard the crash beni and the americans have their 
 guns pointed at the floor the egyptologist could care less 
 he looks at the diggers gripping their crowbars and yells 
 egyptologist 
 feni 
 the three diggers pull hard the ancient seams start to give 
 the egyptologist yells again the diggers pull harder the 
 compartment starts to loosen again he yells the diggers 
 give one final pull and 
 an intense burst of liquid sprays out of the seam hits the 
 three diggers melts their skin clean off they scream dying 
 horribly half skeletal by the time they hit the ground 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 the dust is starting to clear evelyn and jonathan 
 slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement 
 we immediately recognize it as imhotepis sarcophagus 
 evelyn 
 oh my god it looks like 
 it looks like a sarcophagus 
 
 why would they bury somebody 
 in the ceiling 
 evelyn 
 they they buried him 
 at the foot of anubis he was 
 either someone of great importance 
 or he did something very naughty 
 int scarab chamber day 
 the warden drops an into his pouch then 
 prying away at another it rips off he drops 
 it into his pouch only he misses and this scarab quietly 
 falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing 
 close on the scarab on the floor it begins to transform 
 the amethyst starts to glow something inside starts to 
 wiggle as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon 
 then it splits open and a real live hideous 
 scurries out it races over to the shoe quickly 
 burrows into the leather and vanishes inside 
 the eyes fly open he starts to scream drops his 
 knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg 
 higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
 large hideous lump burrowing under his skin it burrows 
 way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest the 
 warden claws and scratches at it trying to stop it the lump 
 burrows up his neck the warden starts gagging and coughing 
 and then the vanishes into his head 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus 
 revealing a single ominous hieroglyph evelyn stares at it 
 jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid 
 jonathan 
 well who is it 
 evelyn stares at the hieroglyph confused and concerned 
 evelyn 
 he that shall not be named 
 dusts off the huge lock 
 
 some sort of lock here 
 you say these are made 
 of granite with a steel interior 
 evelyn 
 quarried granite with a cobalt lining 
 jonathan 
 in here sure 
 getting out 
 
 no kiddin without a key 
 take us a month to crack this thing 
 evelyn 
 a key it what he 
 was talking about 
 
 who was talking about what 
 evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on back 
 evelyn 
 the man on the barge the one 
 with the hook he was looking 
 for a key 
 evelyn pulls out the jonathan tries to take it back 
 jonathan 
 hey mine 
 evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box now 
 shaped exactly like the keyhole evelyn smiles and 
 when they hear the screams echoing through 
 the labyrinth all three of them turn and running 
 int labyrinth day 
 the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the 
 labyrinth totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head 
 evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden 
 starts ripping his own hair out of his head and 
 jonathan grab at the hands but far too crazed 
 he shoves them aside runs full bore down the length of the 
 labyrinth and slams his head straight into a rock wall the 
 warden drops to the ground dead as lead eyes wide open 
 evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring 
 breathing hard themselves 
 ext base camp night 
 evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire 
 evelyn 
 what do you suppose killed him 
 jonathan 
 did you ever see him eat 
 comes up over some rocks 
 
 seems the americans had a little 
 misadventure of their own today 
 three of their diggers were killed 
 evelyn 
 how 
 
 salt acid pressurized salt acid 
 some sort of ancient 
 jonathan 
 maybe this place really is cursed 
 a gust of wind blows through the camp the campfire flickers 
 and jonathan share a nervous look evelyn laughs 
 evelyn 
 two 
 
 believe in curses huh 
 evelyn 
 no i believe if i can see it 
 and i can touch it then 
 real what i believe 
 cocks his rifle gives her a big grin 
 
 i believe in being prepared 
 jonathan opens the pouch the one that held the 
 scarabs he reaches in starts scrounging around we slowly 
 push in waiting for the attack the music builds and then 
 jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the 
 pouch and evelyn both jump 
 
 what what is it 
 jonathan sucks his finger then reaches back into the pouch 
 and pulls out a liquor bottle the top has been chipped off 
 jonathan 
 seagrams 
 jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch inside 
 out and shakes it nothing but sand is inside it 
 jonathan 
 well he may have been a stinky 
 he had good taste 
 jonathan takes a swig and evelyn laugh guiltily 
 and then suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to 
 the sand evelyn and jonathan watch him a beat and then a 
 barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp 
 jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn 
 
 stay here 
 he takes off running through the ruins evelyn immediately 
 gets up and runs after him jonathan grabs a gun holds the 
 bottle of seagrams tight and dashes after her 
 jonathan 
 evy excuse me but 
 the man just say 
 ext american camp night 
 the american camp is under siege two dozen mumia riders 
 gallop through firing rifles several diggers are killed as 
 they run the americans leap out of their tents firing kill 
 multiple riders daniels is shot spins and falls keeps 
 shooting henderson and burns run to his aid blasting away

 ardeth bay gallops through the camp cutting diggers down 
 with his scimitar runs up on top of some rocks 
 leaps out and tackles him off his horse the two men slam to 
 the ground spins up onto one knee and fires point 
 blank blows the scimitar out of ardeth hand 
 is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them 
 
 a scimitar swoops down almost takes head off 
 misses him by an inch leaps up and blows the rider 
 off his mount the horse bolts but ardeth bay is gone 
 evelyn hides behind some rocks watching the scene suddenly 
 she hears something coming up behind her and spins around 
 a vicious tattooed mumia rider races at her evelyn quickly 
 backpedals over the rocks terrified the mumia rider raises 
 his scimitar about to strike evelyn screams trips over a 
 rock and fires the elephant gun blam blows the rider off 
 his mount and catapults him twenty feet back into some ruins 
 at the same time the kick blows evelyn off her feet and over 
 a ridge she flails through the air and lands in a sand dune 
 jonathan and some diggers are holding their own near the 
 temple door four riders come charging right at them 
 jonathan takes a swig off the seagrams 
 jonathan 
 let em have it boys 
 jonathan and the diggers open fire when the smoke clears 
 the riders are either dead or gone jonathan grins 
 jonathan 
 i say bloody good show 
 and then several more mumia leap off the temple and land 
 behind them jonathan and the remaining diggers spin around 
 and suddenly find themselves in combat 
 is quickly loading his pistol he hears something 
 thundering up behind him he spins around just as ardeth bay 
 on a horse swings his scimitar instinctively 
 raises his hands to protect his face the scimitar strikes 
 hits his gun ching gun flips away disarmed 
 dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
 of dynamite in his hand he shoves the fuse into a fire it 
 ignites he faces ardeth bay towering above him the two men 
 lock eyes the fuse continues to burn down ardeth bay points 
 his scimitar at head 
 ardeth bay 
 leave this place leave this 
 place or die 
 ardeth bay gallops off the remaining mumia riders race after 
 him vanishing into the night watches them leave 
 then turns to the burning fuse and blows it out evelyn 
 staggers up looking very shaken gently takes her 
 and holds her close 
 
 you alright 
 evelyn looks up into his strong eyes the first time 
 shown genuine concern for her and she likes it 
 also holding her a little too close and she likes that too 
 evelyn 
 yes fine thank you 
 beni crawls out from under some pillars as henderson and 
 burns help daniels to his feet 
 daniels 
 see that proves it old 
 gotta be under this sand 
 henderson 
 for them to protect it like this

 these men are a desert people

 the toil of trace and trail 
 
 
 thirty days from the time it left dawson the salt water mail with buck and his mates at the fore arrived at skaguay they were in a wretched state worn out and worn down one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen the rest of his mates though lighter dogs had relatively lost more weight than he pike the malingerer who in his lifetime of deceit had often successfully feigned a hurt leg was now limping in earnest was limping and dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder blade 
 they were all terribly footsore no spring or rebound was left in them their feet fell heavily on the trail jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a travel there was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired it was not the dead tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort from which recovery is a matter of hours but it was the dead tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil there was no power of recuperation left no reserve strength to call upon it had been all used the last least bit of it every muscle every fiber every cell was tired dead tired and there was reason for it in less than five months they had traveled hundred miles during the last eighteen hundred of which they had but five days rest when they arrived at skaguay they were apparently on their last legs they could barely keep the traces taut and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled 
 mush on poor sore feets the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of skaguay dis is de last den we get one long rest eh for sure one bully long rest 
 the drivers confidently expected a long stopover themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing but so many were the men who had rushed into the klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on alpine proportions also there were official orders fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail the worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold 
 three days passed by which time buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the states came along and bought them harness and all for a song the men addressed each other as hal and charles charles was a lightish colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty with a big revolver and a hunting knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges this belt was the most salient thing about him it advertised his callowness sheer and unutterable both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding 
 buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the government agent and knew that the scotch and the drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and francois and the others who had gone before when driven with his mates to the new owners camp buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent dishes unwashed everything in disorder also he saw a woman mercedes the men called her she was wife and nice family party 
 buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled there was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been the tin dishes were packed away unwashed mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice when they put a on the front of the sled she suggested it should go on the back and when they had it put on the back and covered it over with a couple of the bundles she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack and they unloaded again 
 three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on grinning and winking at one another 
 got a right smart load as it is said one of them and its not me should tell you your business but i tote that tent along if i was you 
 undreamed of cried mercedes throwing up her hands in dainty dismay however in the world could i manage without a tent 
 springtime and you get any more cold weather the man replied 
 she shook her head decidedly and charles and hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load 
 think ride one of the men asked 
 why it charles demanded rather shortly 
 oh all right all right the man hastened meekly to say i was just a wondering that is all it seemed a mite 
 charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could which was not in the least well 
 and of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them affirmed a second of the men 
 certainly said hal with freezing politeness taking hold of the with one hand and swinging his whip from the other mush he shouted mush on there 
 the dogs sprang against the breastbands strained hard for a few moments then relaxed they were unable to move the sled 
 the lazy brutes show them he cried preparing to lash out at them with the whip 
 but mercedes interfered crying oh hal you as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him the poor dears now you must promise you be harsh with them for the rest of the trip or i go a step 
 precious lot you know about dogs her brother sneered and i wish leave me alone lazy i tell you and got to whip them to get anything out of them their way you ask anyone ask one of those men 
 mercedes looked at them imploringly untold repugnances at sight of pain written in her pretty face 
 weak as water if you want to know came the reply from one of the men plum tuckered out the matter they need a rest 
 rest be blanked said hal with his beardless lips and mercedes said oh in pain and sorrow at the oath 
 but she was a clannish creature and rushed at once to the defense of her brother never mind that man she said pointedly driving our dogs and you do what you think best with them 
 again whip fell upon the dogs they threw themselves against the breastbands dug their feet into the packed snow got down low to it and put forth all their strength the sled held as though it were an anchor after two efforts they stood still panting the whip was whistling savagely when once more mercedes interfered she dropped on her knees before buck with tears in her eyes and put her arms around his neck 
 you poor poor dears she cried sympathetically why you pull hard then you be whipped buck did not like her but he was feeling too miserable to resist her taking it as a part of the miserable work 
 one of the onlookers who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech now spoke up 
 not that i care a whoop what becomes of you but for the dogs sakes i just want to tell you you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled the runners are froze fast throw your weight against the right and left and break it out 
 a third time the attempt was made but this time following the advice hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow the overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows a hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street it would have required an experienced man to keep the sled upright and hal was not such a man as they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings the dogs never stopped the lightened sled bounded on its side behind them they were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load buck was raging he broke into a run the team following his lead hal cried whoa whoa but they gave no heed he tripped and was pulled off his feet the capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street adding to the gaiety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare 
 citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings also they gave advice half the load and twice the dogs if they ever expected to reach dawson was what was said hal and his sister and listened unwillingly pitched tent and overhauled the outfit canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about blankets for a hotel quoth one of the men who laughed and helped half as many is too much get rid of them throw away that tent and all those going to wash them anyway good lord do you think traveling on a pullman 
 and so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous mercedes cried when her were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out she cried in general and she cried in particular over each discarded thing she clasped hands about knees rocking back and forth she averred she would not go an inch not for a dozen charleses she appealed to everybody and to everything finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries and in her zeal when she had finished with her own she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado 
 this accomplished the outfit though cut in half was still a formidable bulk charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs they added to the six of the original team and teek and koona the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip brought the team up to fourteen but the outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much three were pointers one was a newfoundland and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed they did not seem to know anything these newcomers buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do he could not teach them what to do they did not take kindly to trace and trail with the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received the two mongrels were without spirit at all bones were the only things breakable about them 
 with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by hundred miles of continuous trail the outlook was anything but bright the two men however were quite cheerful and they were proud too they were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson or come in from dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs but charles and hal did not know this they had worked the trip out with a pencil so much to a dog so many dogs and so many days mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple 
 late next morning buck led the long team up the street there was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows they were starting dead weary four times he had covered the distance between salt water and dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter his heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog the outsiders were timid and frightened the insiders without confidence in their masters 
 buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman they did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn they were slack in all things without order or discipline it took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load some days they did not make ten miles on other days they were unable to get started at all and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their computation 
 it was inevitable that they should go short on dog food but they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence the outsider dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites and when in addition to this the huskies pulled weakly hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small he doubled it and to cap it all when mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the and fed them slyly but is was not food that buck and the huskies needed but rest and though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely 
 then came the underfeeding hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog food was and the distance only quarter covered further that for love or money no additional dog food was to be obtained so he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the travel his sister and seconded him but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence it was a simple matter to give the dogs less food but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from traveling longer hours not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves 
 the first to go was dub poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker his wrenched untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally hal shot him with the big revolver it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky the newfoundland went first followed by the three pointers the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life but going in the end 
 by this time all the amenities and gentleness of the southland had fallen away from the three people shorn of its glamour and romance arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarreling with her husband and brother to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it it the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore and remain sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman they had no inkling of such a patience they were stiff and in pain their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night 
 charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance it was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity sometimes mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire a dispute which concerned only charles and hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead that views on art or the sort of society plays his brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of political prejudices and that tongue should be relevant to the building of a yukon fire was apparent only to mercedes who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her family in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp and the dogs unfed 
 mercedes nursed a special grievance of sex she was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days but the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous it was her custom to be helpless they complained upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex prerogative she made their lives unendurable she no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding in the sled she was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals she rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still charles and hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality 
 on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength they never did it again she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail they went on their way but she did not move after they had traveled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again 
 in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals theory which he practiced on others was that one must get hardened he had started out preaching it to his sister and failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club at the five fingers the dog food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horsehide for the revolver that kept the big hunting knife company at hip a poor substitute for food was this hide just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back in its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and unnutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair irritating and indigestible 
 and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare he pulled when he could when he could no longer pull he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat the hair hung down limp and draggled or matted with dried blood where club had bruised him his muscles had wasted away to knotty strings and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness it was heartbreaking only heart was unbreakable the man in the red sweater had proved that 
 as it was with buck so was it with his mates they were perambulating skeletons there were seven all together including him in their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club the pain of the beating was dull and distant just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant they were not or they were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly when a halt was made they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out and when the club or whip fell upon them the spark fluttered feebly up and they tottered to their feet and staggered on 
 there came a day when billee the fell and could not rise hal had traded off his revolver so he took the axe and knocked billee on the head as he lay in the traces then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side buck saw and his mates saw and they knew that this thing was very close to them on the next day koona went and but five of them remained joe too far gone to be malignant pike crippled and limping only and not conscious enough longer to malinger the still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull teek who had not traveled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher and buck still at the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet 
 it was beautiful spring weather but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it each day the sun rose earlier and set later it was dawn by three in the morning and twilight lingered till nine at night the whole long day was a blaze of sunshine the ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life this murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living it came from the things that lived and moved again things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost the sap was rising in the pines the willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green crickets sang in the nights and in the days all manner of creeping crawling things rustled forth into the sun partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest squirrels were chattering birds singing and overhead honked the wild fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air 
 from every hill slope came the trickle of water the music of unseen fountains all things were thawing bending snapping the yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down it ate away from beneath the sun ate from above formed fissures sprang and spread apart while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river and amid all this bursting rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men the woman and the huskies 
 with the dogs falling mercedes weeping and riding hal swearing innocuously and charles eyes wistfully watering they staggered into john camp at the mouth of the white river when they halted the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead mercedes dried her eyes and looked at john thornton charles sat down on a log to rest he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness hal did the talking john thornton was whittling the last touches on an he had made from a stick of birch he whittled and listened gave monosyllabic replies and when it was asked terse advice he knew the breed and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed 
 they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over hal said in response to warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice they told us we make white river and here we are this last with a sneering ring of triumph in it 
 and they told you true john thornton answered the likely to drop out at any moment only fools with the blind luck of fools could have made it i tell you straight i risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in alaska 
 because not a fool i suppose said hal all the same go on to dawson he uncoiled his whip get up there buck hi get up there mush on 
 thornton went on whittling it was idle he knew to get between a fool and his folly while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things 
 but the team did not get up at the command it had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it the whip flashed out here and there on its merciless errands john thornton compressed his lips was the first to crawl to his feet teek followed joe came next yelping with pain pike made painful efforts twice he fell over when and on the third attempt managed to rise buck made no effort he lay quietly where he had fallen the lash bit into him again and again but he neither whined nor struggled several times thornton started as though to speak but changed his mind a moisture came into his eyes and as the whipping continued he arose and walked irresolutely up and down 
 this was the first time buck had failed in itself a sufficient reason to drive hal into a rage he exchanged the whip for the customary club buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him like his mates he was barely able to get up but unlike them he had made up his mind not to get up he had a vague feeling of impending doom this had been strong upon him when he pulled into the bank and it had not departed from him what of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him he refused to stir so greatly had he suffered and so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much and as they continued to fall upon him the spark of life within flickered and went down it was nearly out he felt strangely numb as though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten the last sensations of pain left him he no longer felt anything though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body but it was no longer his body it seemed so far away 
 and then suddenly without warning uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal john thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club hal was hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree mercedes screamed charles looked on wistfully wiped his watery eyes but did not get up because of his stiffness 
 john thornton stood over buck struggling to control himself too convulsed with rage to speak 
 if you strike that dog again kill you he at last managed to say in a choking voice 
 my dog hal replied wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back get out of my way or fix you going to dawson 
 thornton stood between him and buck and evinced no intention of getting out of the way hal drew his long hunting knife mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria thornton rapped knuckles with the knocking the knife to the ground he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up then he stooped picked it up himself and with two strokes cut traces 
 hal had no fight left in him besides his hands were full with his sister or his arms rather while buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled a few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river buck heard them go and raised his head to see pike was leading was at the wheel and between were joe and teek they were limping and staggering mercedes was riding the loaded sled hal guided at the and charles stumbled along in the rear 
 as buck watched them thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones by the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the with hal clinging to it jerk into the air mercedes scream came to their ears they saw charles turn one step to run back sand then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear a yawning hole was all that was to be seen the bottom had dropped out of the trail 
 you poor devil said john thornton and buck licked his hand

 not that i care a whoop what becomes of you but for the dogs sakes i just want to tell you you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled the runners are froze fast throw your weight against the right and left and break it out 
 a third time the attempt was made but this time following the advice hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow the overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows a hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street it would have required an experienced man to keep the sled upright and hal was not such a man as they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings the dogs never stopped the lightened sled bounded on its side behind them they were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load buck was raging he broke into a run the team following his lead hal cried whoa whoa but they gave no heed he tripped and was pulled off his feet the capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street adding to the gaiety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare 
 citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings also they gave advice half the load and twice the dogs if they ever expected to reach dawson was what was said hal and his sister and listened unwillingly pitched tent and overhauled the outfit canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about blankets for a hotel quoth one of the men who laughed and helped half as many is too much get rid of them throw away that tent and all those going to wash them anyway good lord do you think traveling on a pullman 
 and so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous mercedes cried when her were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out she cried in general and she cried in particular over each discarded thing she clasped hands about knees rocking back and forth she averred she would not go an inch not for a dozen charleses she appealed to everybody and to everything finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries and in her zeal when she had finished with her own she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado 
 this accomplished the outfit though cut in half was still a formidable bulk charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs they added to the six of the original team and teek and koona the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip brought the team up to fourteen but the outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much three were pointers one was a newfoundland and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed they did not seem to know anything these newcomers buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do he could not teach them what to do they did not take kindly to trace and trail with the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received the two mongrels were without spirit at all bones were the only things breakable about them 
 with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by hundred miles of continuous trail the outlook was anything but bright the two men however were quite cheerful and they were proud too they were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson or come in from dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs but charles and hal did not know this they had worked the trip out with a pencil so much to a dog so many dogs and so many days mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple 
 late next morning buck led the long team up the street there was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows they were starting dead weary four times he had covered the distance between salt water and dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter his heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog the outsiders were timid and frightened the insiders without confidence in their masters 
 buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman they did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn they were slack in all things without order or discipline it took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load some days they did not make ten miles on other days they were unable to get started at all and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their computation 
 it was inevitable that they should go short on dog food but they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence the outsider dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites and when in addition to this the huskies pulled weakly hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small he doubled it and to cap it all when mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the and fed them slyly but is was not food that buck and the huskies needed but rest and though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely 
 then came the underfeeding hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog food was and the distance only quarter covered further that for love or money no additional dog food was to be obtained so he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the travel his sister and seconded him but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence it was a simple matter to give the dogs less food but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from traveling longer hours not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves 
 the first to go was dub poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker his wrenched untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally hal shot him with the big revolver it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky the newfoundland went first followed by the three pointers the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life but going in the end 
 by this time all the amenities and gentleness of the southland had fallen away from the three people shorn of its glamour and romance arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarreling with her husband and brother to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it it the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore and remain sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman they had no inkling of such a patience they were stiff and in pain their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night 
 charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance it was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity sometimes mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire a dispute which concerned only charles and hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead that views on art or the sort of society plays his brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of political prejudices and that tongue should be relevant to the building of a yukon fire was apparent only to mercedes who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her family in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp and the dogs unfed 
 mercedes nursed a special grievance of sex she was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days but the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous it was her custom to be helpless they complained upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex prerogative she made their lives unendurable she no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding in the sled she was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals she rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still charles and hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality 
 on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength they never did it again she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail they went on their way but she did not move after they had traveled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again 
 in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals theory which he practiced on others was that one must get hardened he had started out preaching it to his sister and failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club at the five fingers the dog food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horsehide for the revolver that kept the big hunting knife company at hip a poor substitute for food was this hide just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back in its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and unnutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair irritating and indigestible 
 and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare he pulled when he could when he could no longer pull he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat the hair hung down limp and draggled or matted with dried blood where club had bruised him his muscles had wasted away to knotty strings and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness it was heartbreaking only heart was unbreakable the man in the red sweater had proved that 
 as it was with buck so was it with his mates they were perambulating skeletons there were seven all together including him in their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club the pain of the beating was dull and distant just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant they were not or they were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly when a halt was made they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out and when the club or whip fell upon them the spark fluttered feebly up and they tottered to their feet and staggered on 
 there came a day when billee the fell and could not rise hal had traded off his revolver so he took the axe and knocked billee on the head as he lay in the traces then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side buck saw and his mates saw and they knew that this thing was very close to them on the next day koona went and but five of them remained joe too far gone to be malignant pike crippled and limping only and not conscious enough longer to malinger the still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull teek who had not traveled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher and buck still at the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet 
 it was beautiful spring weather but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it each day the sun rose earlier and set later it was dawn by three in the morning and twilight lingered till nine at night the whole long day was a blaze of sunshine the ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life this murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living it came from the things that lived and moved again things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost the sap was rising in the pines the willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green crickets sang in the nights and in the days all manner of creeping crawling things rustled forth into the sun partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest squirrels were chattering birds singing and overhead honked the wild fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air 
 from every hill slope came the trickle of water the music of unseen fountains all things were thawing bending snapping the yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down it ate away from beneath the sun ate from above formed fissures sprang and spread apart while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river and amid all this bursting rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men the woman and the huskies 
 with the dogs falling mercedes weeping and riding hal swearing innocuously and charles eyes wistfully watering they staggered into john camp at the mouth of the white river when they halted the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead mercedes dried her eyes and looked at john thornton charles sat down on a log to rest he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness hal did the talking john thornton was whittling the last touches on an he had made from a stick of birch he whittled and listened gave monosyllabic replies and when it was asked terse advice he knew the breed and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed 
 they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over hal said in response to warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice they told us we make white river and here we are this last with a sneering ring of triumph in it 
 and they told you true john thornton answered the likely to drop out at any moment only fools with the blind luck of fools could have made it i tell you straight i risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in alaska 
 because not a fool i suppose said hal all the same go on to dawson he uncoiled his whip get up there buck hi get up there mush on 
 thornton went on whittling it was idle he knew to get between a fool and his folly while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things 
 but the team did not get up at the command it had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it the whip flashed out here and there on its merciless errands john thornton compressed his lips was the first to crawl to his feet teek followed joe came next yelping with pain pike made painful efforts twice he fell over when and on the third attempt managed to rise buck made no effort he lay quietly where he had fallen the lash bit into him again and again but he neither whined nor struggled several times thornton started as though to speak but changed his mind a moisture came into his eyes and as the whipping continued he arose and walked irresolutely up and down 
 this was the first time buck had failed in itself a sufficient reason to drive hal into a rage he exchanged the whip for the customary club buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him like his mates he was barely able to get up but unlike them he had made up his mind not to get up he had a vague feeling of impending doom this had been strong upon him when he pulled into the bank and it had not departed from him what of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him he refused to stir so greatly had he suffered and so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much and as they continued to fall upon him the spark of life within flickered and went down it was nearly out he felt strangely numb as though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten the last sensations of pain left him he no longer felt anything though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body but it was no longer his body it seemed so far away 
 and then suddenly without warning uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal john thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club hal was hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree mercedes screamed charles looked on wistfully wiped his watery eyes but did not get up because of his stiffness 
 john thornton stood over buck struggling to control himself too convulsed with rage to speak 
 if you strike that dog again kill you he at last managed to say in a choking voice 
 my dog hal replied wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back get out of my way or fix you going to dawson 
 thornton stood between him and buck and evinced no intention of getting out of the way hal drew his long hunting knife mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria thornton rapped knuckles with the knocking the knife to the ground he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up then he stooped picked it up himself and with two strokes cut traces 
 hal had no fight left in him besides his hands were full with his sister or his arms rather while buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled a few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river buck heard them go and raised his head to see pike was leading was at the wheel and between were joe and teek they were limping and staggering mercedes was riding the loaded sled hal guided at the and charles stumbled along in the rear 
 as buck watched them thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones by the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the with hal clinging to it jerk into the air mercedes scream came to their ears they saw charles turn one step to run back sand then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear a yawning hole was all that was to be seen the bottom had dropped out of the trail 
 you poor devil said john thornton and buck licked his hand

lionfish nov chapter five the whomping willowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for liking he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive 
 
 on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed 
 
 it took a long while to get started next morning they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do mrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying trunk to the car 
 
 harry see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added 
 
 not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily 
 
 when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i mean never know it was this roomy from the outside would you 
 
 mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time to wonder when see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that left her diary by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high 
 
 mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 no arthur 
 
 no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster i installed get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser 
 
 i said no arthur not in broad daylight 
 
 they reached cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station 
 
 harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and which visible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing 
 
 percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier 
 
 percy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went next fred and george followed 
 
 take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing hand and setting off in the blink of an eye they were gone 
 
 go together only got a minute ron said to harry 
 
 harry made sure that cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he felt perfectly confident this nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feet away from it they broke into a run and 
 
 crash 
 
 both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes think doing 
 
 lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd 
 
 why we get through harry hissed to ron 
 
 i dunno 
 
 ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were still watching them 
 
 going to miss the train ron whispered i understand why the sealed itself 
 
 harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach ten seconds nine seconds 
 
 he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solid 
 
 three seconds two seconds one second 
 
 gone said ron sounding stunned the left what if mum and dad get back through to us have you got any muggle money 
 
 harry gave a hollow laughed the dursleys given me pocket money for about six years 
 
 ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier 
 
 hear a thing he said tensely we going to do i know how long take mum and dad to get back to us 
 
 they looked around people were still watching them mainly because of continuing screeches 
 
 i think better go and wait by the car said harry attracting too much atten 
 
 harry said ron his eyes gleaming the car 
 
 what about it 
 
 we can fly the car to hogwarts 
 
 but i thought 
 
 stuck right and got to get to school we and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy 
 
 but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way how will they get home 
 
 they need the car said ron impatiently they know how to apparate you know just vanish and reappear at home they only bother with floo powder and the car because all underage and not allowed to apparate yet 
 
 feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement 
 
 can you fly it 
 
 no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit go if we hurry be able to follow the hogwarts express 
 
 and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked 
 
 ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front 
 
 check that no watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty 
 
 okay he said 
 
 ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car around them vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars 
 
 go said voice from his right 
 
 and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them 
 
 then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared 
 
 said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster faulty 
 
 both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered back again 
 
 hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy 
 
 now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides 
 
 we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron 
 
 dip back down again quickly 
 
 they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground 
 
 i can see it harry yelled right ahead there 
 
 the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake 
 
 due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard okay just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on 
 
 and they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight 
 
 it was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun 
 
 all got to worry about now are airplanes said ron 
 
 they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they stop 
 
 it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing and jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle 
 
 they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches 
 
 several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch why they been able to get onto platform nine and 
 
 be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink ready for another check on the train 
 
 it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds 
 
 ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine 
 
 harry and ron exchanged nervous glances 
 
 probably just tired said ron never been this far before 
 
 and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars were blossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest 
 
 not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously 
 
 when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew 
 
 there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump straight ahead 
 
 silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle 
 
 but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed 
 
 come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on 
 
 the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake 
 
 the car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbled again 
 
 come on ron muttered 
 
 they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down 
 
 there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely 
 
 said ron into the silence 
 
 the nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall 
 
 noooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time 
 
 ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket 
 
 stop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them 
 
 watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late 
 
 crunch 
 
 with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a lump was throbbing on head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan 
 
 are you okay harry said urgently 
 
 my wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand 
 
 it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters 
 
 harry opened his mouth to say he was sure be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof 
 
 happen 
 
 ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the tree they had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach 
 
 aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving in 
 
 run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch 
 
 done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted 
 
 reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach 
 
 that panted ron was close well done car 
 
 the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily 
 
 come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand kill me 
 
 but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust 
 
 can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers of all the trees we hit we had to get one that hits back 
 
 he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly 
 
 come on said harry wearily better get up to the school 
 
 it at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors 
 
 i think the already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window hey harry come and look the sorting 
 
 harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall 
 
 innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars 
 
 through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of first years filing into the hall ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers 
 
 every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years 
 
 a very small boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and glasses shining brightly in the candlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet 
 
 hang on harry muttered to ron an empty chair at the staff table snape 
 
 professor severus snape was least favorite teacher harry also happened to be least favorite student cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions 
 
 maybe ill said ron hopefully 
 
 maybe left said harry because he missed out on the defense against dark arts job again 
 
 or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i mean everyone hates him 
 
 or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them waiting to hear why you two arrive on the school train 
 
 harry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble 
 
 follow me said snape 
 
 not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons 
 
 in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing 
 
 they entered office shivering the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry really want to know the name of at the moment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the door and turned to look at them 
 
 so he said softly the train good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys 
 
 no sir it was the barrier at cross it 
 
 silence said snape coldly what have you done with the car ron gulped this the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily dear dear his own son 
 
 harry felt as though just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad larger branches if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he thought of that 
 
 i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on 
 
 that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out 
 
 silence snapped snape again most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power you will wait here 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other harry feel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind desk if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict 
 
 ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted 
 
 sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire 
 
 explain she said her glasses glinting ominously 
 
 ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through 
 
 so we had no choice professor we get on the train 
 
 why you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry 
 
 harry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done 
 
 i i think 
 
 that said professor mcgonagall is obvious 
 
 there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore 
 
 whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusually grave he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow 
 
 there was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain why you did this 
 
 it would have been better if he had shouted harry hated the disappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles 
 
 go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice 
 
 what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall 
 
 well expelling us you said ron 
 
 harry looked quickly at dumbledore 
 
 not today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing to both your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you 
 
 snape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature 
 
 it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these severus said dumbledore calmly they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva got to give out a few notices come severus a custard tart i want to sample 
 
 snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle 
 
 better get along to the hospital wing weasley bleeding 
 
 not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve 
 
 professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted 
 
 the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall your sister is also in gryffindor 
 
 oh good said ron 
 
 and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term started so so gryffindor really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anyway 
 
 i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected as for writing to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectly well just be disappointed that the whomping willow squashed him flat 
 
 professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at desk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop 
 
 you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said i must also return to the feast 
 
 when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle 
 
 i thought had it he said grabbing a sandwich 
 
 so did i said harry taking one too 
 
 can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham fred and george flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite why we get through the barrier 
 
 harry shrugged have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we gone up to the feast 
 
 she want us showing off said ron sagely want people to think clever arriving by flying car 
 
 when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress 
 
 password she said as they approached 
 
 er said harry 
 
 they know the new password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them 
 
 there you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said been expelled for crashing a flying car 
 
 well we been expelled harry assured her 
 
 not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall 
 
 skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password 
 
 wattlebird said hermione impatiently but not the point 
 
 her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached through the portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them 
 
 brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying a car right into the whomping willow be talking about that one for years 
 
 good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though just won a marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why come in the car eh 
 
 ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who look happy at all percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in direction ron got the point at once 
 
 got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories 
 
 night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like 
 
 they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years they entered the familiar circular room with its five hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds 
 
 ron grinned guiltily at harry 
 
 i know i enjoyed that or anything but 
 
 the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom 
 
 unbelievable beamed seamus 
 
 cool said dean 
 
 amazing said neville awestruck 
 
 harry help it he grinned too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the whomping willowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for liking he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive 
 
 on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed 
 
 it took a long while to get started next morning they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do mrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying trunk to the car 
 
 harry see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added 
 
 not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily 
 
 when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i mean never know it was this roomy from the outside would you 
 
 mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time to wonder when see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that left her diary by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high 
 
 mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 no arthur 
 
 no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster i installed get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser 
 
 i said no arthur not in broad daylight 
 
 they reached cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station 
 
 harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and which visible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing 
 
 percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier 
 
 percy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went next fred and george followed 
 
 take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing hand and setting off in the blink of an eye they were gone 
 
 go together only got a minute ron said to harry 
 
 harry made sure that cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he felt perfectly confident this nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feet away from it they broke into a run and 
 
 crash 
 
 both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes think doing 
 
 lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd 
 
 why we get through harry hissed to ron 
 
 i dunno 
 
 ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were still watching them 
 
 going to miss the train ron whispered i understand why the sealed itself 
 
 harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach ten seconds nine seconds 
 
 he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solid 
 
 three seconds two seconds one second 
 
 gone said ron sounding stunned the left what if mum and dad get back through to us have you got any muggle money 
 
 harry gave a hollow laughed the dursleys given me pocket money for about six years 
 
 ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier 
 
 hear a thing he said tensely we going to do i know how long take mum and dad to get back to us 
 
 they looked around people were still watching them mainly because of continuing screeches 
 
 i think better go and wait by the car said harry attracting too much atten 
 
 harry said ron his eyes gleaming the car 
 
 what about it 
 
 we can fly the car to hogwarts 
 
 but i thought 
 
 stuck right and got to get to school we and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy 
 
 but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way how will they get home 
 
 they need the car said ron impatiently they know how to apparate you know just vanish and reappear at home they only bother with floo powder and the car because all underage and not allowed to apparate yet 
 
 feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement 
 
 can you fly it 
 
 no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit go if we hurry be able to follow the hogwarts express 
 
 and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked 
 
 ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front 
 
 check that no watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty 
 
 okay he said 
 
 ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car around them vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars 
 
 go said voice from his right 
 
 and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them 
 
 then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared 
 
 said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster faulty 
 
 both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered back again 
 
 hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy 
 
 now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides 
 
 we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron 
 
 dip back down again quickly 
 
 they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground 
 
 i can see it harry yelled right ahead there 
 
 the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake 
 
 due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard okay just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on 
 
 and they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight 
 
 it was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun 
 
 all got to worry about now are airplanes said ron 
 
 they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they stop 
 
 it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing and jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle 
 
 they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches 
 
 several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch why they been able to get onto platform nine and 
 
 be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink ready for another check on the train 
 
 it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds 
 
 ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine 
 
 harry and ron exchanged nervous glances 
 
 probably just tired said ron never been this far before 
 
 and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars were blossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest 
 
 not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously 
 
 when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew 
 
 there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump straight ahead 
 
 silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle 
 
 but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed 
 
 come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on 
 
 the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake 
 
 the car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbled again 
 
 come on ron muttered 
 
 they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down 
 
 there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely 
 
 said ron into the silence 
 
 the nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall 
 
 noooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time 
 
 ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket 
 
 stop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them 
 
 watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late 
 
 crunch 
 
 with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a lump was throbbing on head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan 
 
 are you okay harry said urgently 
 
 my wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand 
 
 it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters 
 
 harry opened his mouth to say he was sure be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof 
 
 happen 
 
 ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the tree they had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach 
 
 aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving in 
 
 run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch 
 
 done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted 
 
 reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach 
 
 that panted ron was close well done car 
 
 the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily 
 
 come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand kill me 
 
 but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust 
 
 can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers of all the trees we hit we had to get one that hits back 
 
 he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly 
 
 come on said harry wearily better get up to the school 
 
 it at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors 
 
 i think the already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window hey harry come and look the sorting 
 
 harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall 
 
 innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars 
 
 through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of first years filing into the hall ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers 
 
 every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years 
 
 a very small boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and glasses shining brightly in the candlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet 
 
 hang on harry muttered to ron an empty chair at the staff table snape 
 
 professor severus snape was least favorite teacher harry also happened to be least favorite student cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions 
 
 maybe ill said ron hopefully 
 
 maybe left said harry because he missed out on the defense against dark arts job again 
 
 or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i mean everyone hates him 
 
 or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them waiting to hear why you two arrive on the school train 
 
 harry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble 
 
 follow me said snape 
 
 not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons 
 
 in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing 
 
 they entered office shivering the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry really want to know the name of at the moment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the door and turned to look at them 
 
 so he said softly the train good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys 
 
 no sir it was the barrier at cross it 
 
 silence said snape coldly what have you done with the car ron gulped this the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily dear dear his own son 
 
 harry felt as though just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad larger branches if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he thought of that 
 
 i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on 
 
 that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out 
 
 silence snapped snape again most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power you will wait here 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other harry feel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind desk if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict 
 
 ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted 
 
 sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire 
 
 explain she said her glasses glinting ominously 
 
 ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through 
 
 so we had no choice professor we get on the train 
 
 why you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry 
 
 harry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done 
 
 i i think 
 
 that said professor mcgonagall is obvious 
 
 there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore 
 
 whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusually grave he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow 
 
 there was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain why you did this 
 
 it would have been better if he had shouted harry hated the disappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles 
 
 go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice 
 
 what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall 
 
 well expelling us you said ron 
 
 harry looked quickly at dumbledore 
 
 not today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing to both your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you 
 
 snape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature 
 
 it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these severus said dumbledore calmly they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva got to give out a few notices come severus a custard tart i want to sample 
 
 snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle 
 
 better get along to the hospital wing weasley bleeding 
 
 not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve 
 
 professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted 
 
 the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall your sister is also in gryffindor 
 
 oh good said ron 
 
 and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term started so so gryffindor really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anyway 
 
 i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected as for writing to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectly well just be disappointed that the whomping willow squashed him flat 
 
 professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at desk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop 
 
 you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said i must also return to the feast 
 
 when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle 
 
 i thought had it he said grabbing a sandwich 
 
 so did i said harry taking one too 
 
 can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham fred and george flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite why we get through the barrier 
 
 harry shrugged have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we gone up to the feast 
 
 she want us showing off said ron sagely want people to think clever arriving by flying car 
 
 when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress 
 
 password she said as they approached 
 
 er said harry 
 
 they know the new password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them 
 
 there you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said been expelled for crashing a flying car 
 
 well we been expelled harry assured her 
 
 not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall 
 
 skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password 
 
 wattlebird said hermione impatiently but not the point 
 
 her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached through the portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them 
 
 brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying a car right into the whomping willow be talking about that one for years 
 
 good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though just won a marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why come in the car eh 
 
 ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who look happy at all percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in direction ron got the point at once 
 
 got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories 
 
 night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like 
 
 they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years they entered the familiar circular room with its five hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds 
 
 ron grinned guiltily at harry 
 
 i know i enjoyed that or anything but 
 
 the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom 
 
 unbelievable beamed seamus 
 
 cool said dean 
 
 amazing said neville awestruck 
 
 harry help it he grinned too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the dementorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable 
 
 the sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy 
 
 got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy again 
 
 they headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion made as a young girl all three of them were rather giggly 
 
 what were you saying ron asked harry as they sat down 
 
 later harry muttered as percy stormed in 
 
 harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudly 
 
 all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerwork let you out on the train 
 
 you snapped ron what about poor scabbers eh 
 
 he pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocket 
 
 mr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuck his head inside 
 
 here he said harry come on 
 
 mr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two dark green cars each of which was driven by a wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet 
 
 in you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded street 
 
 harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione ron and to disgust percy 
 
 the journey to cross was very uneventful compared with trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle new company car certainly have managed they reached cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights 
 
 mr weasley kept close to elbow all the way into the station 
 
 right then he said glancing around them do this in pairs as there are so many of us go through first with harry 
 
 mr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten pushing trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated him 
 
 in a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train 
 
 percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run 
 
 ah penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she miss his shiny badge 
 
 once the remaining weasleys and hermione had joined them harry and mr weasley led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty they loaded the trunks onto it stowed hedwig and crookshanks in the luggage rack then went back outside to say goodbye to mr and mrs weasley 
 
 mrs weasley kissed all her children then hermione and finally harry he was embarrassed but really quite pleased when she gave him an extra hug 
 
 do take care you harry she said as she straightened up her eyes oddly bright then she opened her enormous handbag and said made you all sandwiches here you are ronno not corned beef fred fred here you are dear 
 
 harry said mr weasley quietly come over here for a moment 
 
 he jerked his head towards a pillar and harry followed him behind it leaving the others crowded around mrs weasley 
 
 something got to tell you before you leave said mr weasley in a tense voice 
 
 all right mr weasley said harry i already know 
 
 you know how could you know 
 
 i er i heard you and mrs wesley talking last night i help hearing harry added quickly sorry 
 
 not the way have chosen for you to find out said mr weasley looking anxious 
 
 no honestly ok this way you broken your word to fudge and i know going on 
 
 harry you must be scared 
 
 not said harry sincerely really he added because mr weasley was looking disbelieving not trying to be a hero but seriously sirius black be worse than lord voldemort can he 
 
 mr weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it 
 
 harry i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than fudge seems to think and obviously pleased that not scared but 
 
 arthur called mrs weasley who was now shepherding the rest onto the train arthur what are you doing about to go 
 
 coming molly said mr weasley but he turned back to harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice listen i want you to give me your word 
 
 that be a good boy and stay in the castle said harry gloomily 
 
 not entirely said mr weasley who looked more serious than harry had ever seen him harry swear to me you go looking for black 
 
 harry stared what 
 
 there was a loud whistle guards were walking along the train slamming all the doors shut 
 
 promise me harry said mr weasley talking more quickly still that whatever happens 
 
 why would i go looking for someone i know wants to kill me said harry blankly 
 
 swear to me that whatever you might hear 
 
 arthur quickly cried mrs weasley 
 
 steam was billowing from the train it had started to move harry ran to the compartment door and ron threw it open and stood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mr and mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view 
 
 i need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speed 
 
 go away ginny said ron 
 
 oh nice said ginny huffily and she stalked off 
 
 harry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train 
 
 this had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cart 
 
 the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with gray 
 
 who reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the window 
 
 professor r j lupin whispered hermione at once 
 
 you know that 
 
 on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters 
 
 wonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor pallid profile 
 
 obvious whispered hermione only one vacancy there defense against the dark arts 
 
 harry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxed 
 
 well i hope up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like on good hex would finish him off he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell us 
 
 harry explained all about mr and mrs argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him when finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you oh have to be really really careful go looking for trouble harry 
 
 i go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me 
 
 how thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakily 
 
 they were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was 
 
 no one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ever done it before and he was a prisoner too 
 
 but catch him they said hermione earnestly i mean got all the muggles looking out for him too 
 
 that noise said ron suddenly 
 
 a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere they looked all around the compartment 
 
 coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of hand and glowing brilliantly 
 
 is that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better look 
 
 yeahmind you a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to leg to send it to harry 
 
 were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdly 
 
 no welli supposed to be using errol you know not really up to long journeysbut how else was i supposed to get present to him 
 
 stick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or wake him up 
 
 he nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on it 
 
 we could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back down they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told me 
 
 do you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly read the only entirely settlement in britain 
 
 yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of way but not why i want to go i just want to get inside honeydukes 
 
 that said hermione 
 
 this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his face where got everythingpepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like thinking what to write nextc 
 
 but a very interesting place it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the goblin rebellion and the shrieking supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain 
 
 c and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was saying 
 
 hermione looked around at harry 
 
 it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade 
 
 spect it will said harry heavily have to tell me when found out 
 
 what mean said ron 
 
 i go the dursleys sign my permission form and fudge either 
 
 ron looked horrified 
 
 not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission 
 
 harry gave a hollow laugh professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house was very strict 
 
 c or we can ask fred and george they know every secret passage out of the castle 
 
 ron said hermione sharply i think harry should be sneaking out of the school with black on the loose 
 
 yeah i expect what mcgonagall will say when i ask of permission said harry bitterly 
 
 but if with him said ron spiritedly to hermione black dare 
 
 oh ron talk rubbish snapped hermione already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street do you really think going to worry about attacking harry just because there 
 
 she was fumbling with the straps of basket as she spoke 
 
 let that thing out ron said but too late crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket stretched yawned and sprang onto knees the lump in pocket trembled and he shoved crookshanks angrily away 
 
 get out of it 
 
 ron said hermione angrily 
 
 ron was about to answer back when professor lupin stirred they watched him apprehensively but he simply turned his head the other way mouth slightly open and slept on 
 
 the hogwarts express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened overhead people were chasing backwards and forwards past the door of their compartment crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat his squashed face turned towards ron his yellow eyes on top pocket 
 
 at one the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door 
 
 think we should wake him up ron asked awkwardly nodding towards professor lupin he looks like he could do with some food 
 
 hermione approached professor lupin cautiously 
 
 er professor she said excuse me professor 
 
 he move 
 
 worry dear said the witch as she handed a large stack of cauldron cakes if hungry when he wakes be up front with the driver 
 
 i suppose he is asleep said ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed i mean he died has he 
 
 no no breathing whispered hermione taking the cauldron cake harry passed her 
 
 he might not be very good company but professor presence in their compartment had its uses just as it had started to rain blurring the rolling hills outside the window they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again and their three least favorite people appeared at the door draco malfoy flanked by his cronies vincent crabbe and gregory goyle 
 
 draco malfoy and harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first journey to hogwarts malfoy who had a pale pointed sneering face was in slytherin house he played seeker on the slytherin quidditch team the same position that harry played on the gryffindor team crabbe and goyle seemed to exist to do bidding they were both wide and muscly crabbe was taller with a haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorilla arms 
 
 well look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weasel 
 
 crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly 
 
 i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer weasley said malfoy did your mother die of shock 
 
 ron stood up so quickly he knocked basket to the floor professor lupin gave a snort 
 
 that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupin 
 
 new teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoy 
 
 pale eyes narrowed he fool enough to pick a fight right under a nose 
 
 he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappeared 
 
 harry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knuckles 
 
 not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrily i mean it if he makes one more crack about my family going to get hold of his head and 
 
 ron made a violent gesture in midair 
 
 ron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be careful 
 
 but professor lupin was still fast asleep 
 
 the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks the train rattled the rain hammered the wind roared but still professor lupin slept 
 
 we must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black window 
 
 the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down 
 
 great said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside starving i want to get to the feast 
 
 we be there yet said hermione checking her watch 
 
 so we stopping 
 
 the train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows 
 
 harry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments 
 
 the train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warning all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness 
 
 going on said voice from behind harry 
 
 ouch gasped hermione ron that was my foot 
 
 harry felt his way back to his seat 
 
 think broken down 
 
 dunno 
 
 there was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ron wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out 
 
 something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboard 
 
 the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over legs 
 
 sorry know going on ouch sorry 
 
 hullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloak 
 
 harry is that you happening 
 
 no idea sit down 
 
 there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanks 
 
 going to go and ask the driver going on came voice harry felt her pass him heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain 
 
 that 
 
 that 
 
 ginny 
 
 hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 i was looking for ron 
 
 come in and sit down 
 
 not here said harry hurriedly here 
 
 ouch said neville 
 
 quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly 
 
 professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his corner 
 
 none of them spoke 
 
 there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames they illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert and wary 
 
 stay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him 
 
 but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it 
 
 standing in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish and scabbed like something dead that had decayed in water 
 
 but it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak 
 
 and then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slow rattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings 
 
 an intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart 
 
 eyes rolled up into his head he see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder 
 
 and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but thick white fog was swirling around him inside him 
 
 harry harry are you all right 
 
 someone was slapping his face 
 
 
 
 harry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his face 
 
 ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat 
 
 are you okay ron asked nervously 
 
 yeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened that that thing who screamed 
 
 no one screamed said ron more nervously still 
 
 harry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very pale 
 
 but i heard screaming 
 
 a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces 
 
 here he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it help 
 
 harry took the chocolate but eat it 
 
 what was that thing he asked lupin 
 
 a dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone else one of the dementors of azkaban 
 
 everyone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket 
 
 eat he repeated help i need to speak to the driver excuse me 
 
 he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor 
 
 are you sure okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiously 
 
 i get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his face 
 
 well that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i see its face and you you 
 
 i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching 
 
 and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementor and pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor move so lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away 
 
 it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came in 
 
 i felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like never be cheerful again 
 
 ginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her 
 
 but any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardly 
 
 no said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad though 
 
 harry understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shame why had he gone to pieces like that when no one else had 
 
 professor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked around and said with a small smile i poisoned that chocolate you know 
 
 harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes 
 
 be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harry 
 
 harry ask how professor lupin knew his name 
 
 fine he muttered embarrassed 
 
 they talk much during the remainder of the journey at long last the train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheets 
 
 firs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake 
 
 all right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the door the coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in procession 
 
 the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again 
 
 as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars harry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a halt and hermione and ron got out 
 
 as harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his ear 
 
 you fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actually fainted 
 
 malfoy elbowed past hermione to block way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously 
 
 shove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clenched 
 
 did you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasley 
 
 is there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage 
 
 malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the dilapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle 
 
 hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors 
 
 the door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you both 
 
 harry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagall transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a stern looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong 
 
 no need to look so worried i just want a word in my office she told them move along there weasley 
 
 ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridor 
 
 once they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fire professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potter 
 
 before harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling in 
 
 harry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fuss 
 
 fine he said i need anything 
 
 oh you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose been doing something dangerous again 
 
 it was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly 
 
 setting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back hair and feeling his forehead he be the last one who collapses yes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate 
 
 not delicate said harry crossly 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulse 
 
 what does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed rest should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing 
 
 fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture 
 
 well he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into eyes 
 
 already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us 
 
 did he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies 
 
 are you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharply 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 very well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast together 
 
 harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hall 
 
 it was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a stool out of the hall 
 
 oh said hermione softly missed the sorting 
 
 new students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast 
 
 he and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seats 
 
 what was all that about he muttered to harry 
 
 harry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke off 
 
 professor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beard spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that why harry respected him you help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment 
 
 welcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beard welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic business 
 
 he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school 
 
 they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he said 
 
 percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a sound 
 
 on a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year 
 
 first professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes 
 
 look at snape ron hissed in ear 
 
 professor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape wanted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry 
 
 as to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacher retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties 
 
 harry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard 
 
 we known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting book 
 
 harry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth 
 
 well i think everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast begin 
 
 the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat 
 
 it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared name last year 
 
 at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chance 
 
 congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers table 
 
 all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe itgreat man dumbledorecame straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said had what i always wanted 
 
 overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away 
 
 harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower where a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them password 
 
 coming through coming through percy called from behind the crowd the new fortuna major 
 
 oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwords 
 
 through the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five beds and harry looking around felt he was home at last 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the dementorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable 
 
 the sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy 
 
 got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy again 
 
 they headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion made as a young girl all three of them were rather giggly 
 
 what were you saying ron asked harry as they sat down 
 
 later harry muttered as percy stormed in 
 
 harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudly 
 
 all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerwork let you out on the train 
 
 you snapped ron what about poor scabbers eh 
 
 he pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocket 
 
 mr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuck his head inside 
 
 here he said harry come on 
 
 mr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two dark green cars each of which was driven by a wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet 
 
 in you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded street 
 
 harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione ron and to disgust percy 
 
 the journey to cross was very uneventful compared with trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle new company car certainly have managed they reached cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights 
 
 mr weasley kept close to elbow all the way into the station 
 
 right then he said glancing around them do this in pairs as there are so many of us go through first with harry 
 
 mr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten pushing trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated him 
 
 in a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train 
 
 percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run 
 
 ah penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she miss his shiny badge 
 
 once the remaining weasleys and hermione had joined them harry and mr weasley led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty they loaded the trunks onto it stowed hedwig and crookshanks in the luggage rack then went back outside to say goodbye to mr and mrs weasley 
 
 mrs weasley kissed all her children then hermione and finally harry he was embarrassed but really quite pleased when she gave him an extra hug 
 
 do take care you harry she said as she straightened up her eyes oddly bright then she opened her enormous handbag and said made you all sandwiches here you are ronno not corned beef fred fred here you are dear 
 
 harry said mr weasley quietly come over here for a moment 
 
 he jerked his head towards a pillar and harry followed him behind it leaving the others crowded around mrs weasley 
 
 something got to tell you before you leave said mr weasley in a tense voice 
 
 all right mr weasley said harry i already know 
 
 you know how could you know 
 
 i er i heard you and mrs wesley talking last night i help hearing harry added quickly sorry 
 
 not the way have chosen for you to find out said mr weasley looking anxious 
 
 no honestly ok this way you broken your word to fudge and i know going on 
 
 harry you must be scared 
 
 not said harry sincerely really he added because mr weasley was looking disbelieving not trying to be a hero but seriously sirius black be worse than lord voldemort can he 
 
 mr weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it 
 
 harry i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than fudge seems to think and obviously pleased that not scared but 
 
 arthur called mrs weasley who was now shepherding the rest onto the train arthur what are you doing about to go 
 
 coming molly said mr weasley but he turned back to harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice listen i want you to give me your word 
 
 that be a good boy and stay in the castle said harry gloomily 
 
 not entirely said mr weasley who looked more serious than harry had ever seen him harry swear to me you go looking for black 
 
 harry stared what 
 
 there was a loud whistle guards were walking along the train slamming all the doors shut 
 
 promise me harry said mr weasley talking more quickly still that whatever happens 
 
 why would i go looking for someone i know wants to kill me said harry blankly 
 
 swear to me that whatever you might hear 
 
 arthur quickly cried mrs weasley 
 
 steam was billowing from the train it had started to move harry ran to the compartment door and ron threw it open and stood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mr and mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view 
 
 i need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speed 
 
 go away ginny said ron 
 
 oh nice said ginny huffily and she stalked off 
 
 harry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train 
 
 this had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cart 
 
 the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with gray 
 
 who reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the window 
 
 professor r j lupin whispered hermione at once 
 
 you know that 
 
 on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters 
 
 wonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor pallid profile 
 
 obvious whispered hermione only one vacancy there defense against the dark arts 
 
 harry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxed 
 
 well i hope up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like on good hex would finish him off he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell us 
 
 harry explained all about mr and mrs argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him when finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you oh have to be really really careful go looking for trouble harry 
 
 i go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me 
 
 how thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakily 
 
 they were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was 
 
 no one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ever done it before and he was a prisoner too 
 
 but catch him they said hermione earnestly i mean got all the muggles looking out for him too 
 
 that noise said ron suddenly 
 
 a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere they looked all around the compartment 
 
 coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of hand and glowing brilliantly 
 
 is that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better look 
 
 yeahmind you a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to leg to send it to harry 
 
 were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdly 
 
 no welli supposed to be using errol you know not really up to long journeysbut how else was i supposed to get present to him 
 
 stick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or wake him up 
 
 he nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on it 
 
 we could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back down they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told me 
 
 do you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly read the only entirely settlement in britain 
 
 yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of way but not why i want to go i just want to get inside honeydukes 
 
 that said hermione 
 
 this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his face where got everythingpepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like thinking what to write nextc 
 
 but a very interesting place it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the goblin rebellion and the shrieking supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain 
 
 c and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was saying 
 
 hermione looked around at harry 
 
 it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade 
 
 spect it will said harry heavily have to tell me when found out 
 
 what mean said ron 
 
 i go the dursleys sign my permission form and fudge either 
 
 ron looked horrified 
 
 not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission 
 
 harry gave a hollow laugh professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house was very strict 
 
 c or we can ask fred and george they know every secret passage out of the castle 
 
 ron said hermione sharply i think harry should be sneaking out of the school with black on the loose 
 
 yeah i expect what mcgonagall will say when i ask of permission said harry bitterly 
 
 but if with him said ron spiritedly to hermione black dare 
 
 oh ron talk rubbish snapped hermione already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street do you really think going to worry about attacking harry just because there 
 
 she was fumbling with the straps of basket as she spoke 
 
 let that thing out ron said but too late crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket stretched yawned and sprang onto knees the lump in pocket trembled and he shoved crookshanks angrily away 
 
 get out of it 
 
 ron said hermione angrily 
 
 ron was about to answer back when professor lupin stirred they watched him apprehensively but he simply turned his head the other way mouth slightly open and slept on 
 
 the hogwarts express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened overhead people were chasing backwards and forwards past the door of their compartment crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat his squashed face turned towards ron his yellow eyes on top pocket 
 
 at one the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door 
 
 think we should wake him up ron asked awkwardly nodding towards professor lupin he looks like he could do with some food 
 
 hermione approached professor lupin cautiously 
 
 er professor she said excuse me professor 
 
 he move 
 
 worry dear said the witch as she handed a large stack of cauldron cakes if hungry when he wakes be up front with the driver 
 
 i suppose he is asleep said ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed i mean he died has he 
 
 no no breathing whispered hermione taking the cauldron cake harry passed her 
 
 he might not be very good company but professor presence in their compartment had its uses just as it had started to rain blurring the rolling hills outside the window they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again and their three least favorite people appeared at the door draco malfoy flanked by his cronies vincent crabbe and gregory goyle 
 
 draco malfoy and harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first journey to hogwarts malfoy who had a pale pointed sneering face was in slytherin house he played seeker on the slytherin quidditch team the same position that harry played on the gryffindor team crabbe and goyle seemed to exist to do bidding they were both wide and muscly crabbe was taller with a haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorilla arms 
 
 well look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weasel 
 
 crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly 
 
 i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer weasley said malfoy did your mother die of shock 
 
 ron stood up so quickly he knocked basket to the floor professor lupin gave a snort 
 
 that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupin 
 
 new teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoy 
 
 pale eyes narrowed he fool enough to pick a fight right under a nose 
 
 he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappeared 
 
 harry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knuckles 
 
 not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrily i mean it if he makes one more crack about my family going to get hold of his head and 
 
 ron made a violent gesture in midair 
 
 ron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be careful 
 
 but professor lupin was still fast asleep 
 
 the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks the train rattled the rain hammered the wind roared but still professor lupin slept 
 
 we must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black window 
 
 the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down 
 
 great said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside starving i want to get to the feast 
 
 we be there yet said hermione checking her watch 
 
 so we stopping 
 
 the train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows 
 
 harry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments 
 
 the train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warning all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness 
 
 going on said voice from behind harry 
 
 ouch gasped hermione ron that was my foot 
 
 harry felt his way back to his seat 
 
 think broken down 
 
 dunno 
 
 there was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ron wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out 
 
 something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboard 
 
 the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over legs 
 
 sorry know going on ouch sorry 
 
 hullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloak 
 
 harry is that you happening 
 
 no idea sit down 
 
 there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanks 
 
 going to go and ask the driver going on came voice harry felt her pass him heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain 
 
 that 
 
 that 
 
 ginny 
 
 hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 i was looking for ron 
 
 come in and sit down 
 
 not here said harry hurriedly here 
 
 ouch said neville 
 
 quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly 
 
 professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his corner 
 
 none of them spoke 
 
 there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames they illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert and wary 
 
 stay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him 
 
 but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it 
 
 standing in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish and scabbed like something dead that had decayed in water 
 
 but it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak 
 
 and then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slow rattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings 
 
 an intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart 
 
 eyes rolled up into his head he see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder 
 
 and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but thick white fog was swirling around him inside him 
 
 harry harry are you all right 
 
 someone was slapping his face 
 
 
 
 harry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his face 
 
 ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat 
 
 are you okay ron asked nervously 
 
 yeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened that that thing who screamed 
 
 no one screamed said ron more nervously still 
 
 harry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very pale 
 
 but i heard screaming 
 
 a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces 
 
 here he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it help 
 
 harry took the chocolate but eat it 
 
 what was that thing he asked lupin 
 
 a dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone else one of the dementors of azkaban 
 
 everyone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket 
 
 eat he repeated help i need to speak to the driver excuse me 
 
 he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor 
 
 are you sure okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiously 
 
 i get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his face 
 
 well that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i see its face and you you 
 
 i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching 
 
 and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementor and pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor move so lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away 
 
 it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came in 
 
 i felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like never be cheerful again 
 
 ginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her 
 
 but any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardly 
 
 no said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad though 
 
 harry understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shame why had he gone to pieces like that when no one else had 
 
 professor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked around and said with a small smile i poisoned that chocolate you know 
 
 harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes 
 
 be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harry 
 
 harry ask how professor lupin knew his name 
 
 fine he muttered embarrassed 
 
 they talk much during the remainder of the journey at long last the train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheets 
 
 firs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake 
 
 all right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the door the coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in procession 
 
 the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again 
 
 as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars harry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a halt and hermione and ron got out 
 
 as harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his ear 
 
 you fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actually fainted 
 
 malfoy elbowed past hermione to block way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously 
 
 shove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clenched 
 
 did you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasley 
 
 is there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage 
 
 malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the dilapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle 
 
 hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors 
 
 the door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you both 
 
 harry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagall transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a stern looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong 
 
 no need to look so worried i just want a word in my office she told them move along there weasley 
 
 ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridor 
 
 once they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fire professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potter 
 
 before harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling in 
 
 harry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fuss 
 
 fine he said i need anything 
 
 oh you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose been doing something dangerous again 
 
 it was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly 
 
 setting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back hair and feeling his forehead he be the last one who collapses yes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate 
 
 not delicate said harry crossly 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulse 
 
 what does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed rest should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing 
 
 fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture 
 
 well he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into eyes 
 
 already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us 
 
 did he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies 
 
 are you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharply 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 very well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast together 
 
 harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hall 
 
 it was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a stool out of the hall 
 
 oh said hermione softly missed the sorting 
 
 new students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast 
 
 he and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seats 
 
 what was all that about he muttered to harry 
 
 harry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke off 
 
 professor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beard spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that why harry respected him you help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment 
 
 welcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beard welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic business 
 
 he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school 
 
 they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he said 
 
 percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a sound 
 
 on a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year 
 
 first professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes 
 
 look at snape ron hissed in ear 
 
 professor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape wanted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry 
 
 as to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacher retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties 
 
 harry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard 
 
 we known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting book 
 
 harry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth 
 
 well i think everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast begin 
 
 the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat 
 
 it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared name last year 
 
 at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chance 
 
 congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers table 
 
 all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe itgreat man dumbledorecame straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said had what i always wanted 
 
 overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away 
 
 harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower where a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them password 
 
 coming through coming through percy called from behind the crowd the new fortuna major 
 
 oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwords 
 
 through the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five beds and harry looking around felt he was home at last 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter five weasleys wizard wheezescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire 
 
 did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet 
 
 yeah said harry straightening up what was it 
 
 toffee said fred brightly george and i invented them and been looking for someone to test them on all summer 
 
 the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers 
 
 you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky he had a broad face which was and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it 
 
 bill got to his feet smiling and also shook hand bill came as something of a surprise harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about and fond of bossing everyone around however bill was there was no other word for it cool he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide 
 
 before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at shoulder he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him 
 
 that funny fred he shouted what on earth did you give that muggle boy 
 
 i give him anything said fred with another evil grin i just dropped was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to 
 
 you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley you knew eat it you knew he was on a diet 
 
 how big did his tongue get george asked eagerly 
 
 it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it 
 
 harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again 
 
 it funny mr weasley shouted that sort of behavior seriously undermines relations i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons 
 
 we give it to him because a muggle said fred indignantly 
 
 no we gave it to him because a great bullying git said george he harry 
 
 yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly 
 
 not the point raged mr weasley you wait until i tell your mother 
 
 tell me what said a voice behind them 
 
 mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion 
 
 oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling then her eyes snapped back to her husband tell me what arthur 
 
 mr weasley hesitated harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was and friend hermione granger the other who was small and was younger sister ginny both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow 
 
 tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice 
 
 nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but had words with them 
 
 what have they done this time said mrs weasley if got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 why you show harry where sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway 
 
 he knows where sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last 
 
 we can all go said hermione pointedly 
 
 oh said ron cottoning on right 
 
 yeah come too said george 
 
 you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley 
 
 harry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories 
 
 what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed 
 
 ron and ginny both laughed although hermione 
 
 mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and room said ron quietly great long price lists for stuff invented joke stuff you know fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff it was brilliant i never knew been inventing all that 
 
 been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny we thought they just liked the noise 
 
 only most of the stuff well all of it really was a bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them told them they allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order furious at them anyway they get as many as she expected 
 
 were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen 
 
 and then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop 
 
 just then a door on the second landing opened and a face poked out wearing glasses and a very annoyed expression 
 
 hi percy said harry 
 
 oh hello harry said percy i was wondering who was making all the noise trying to work in here you know got a report to finish for the office and rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs 
 
 not thundering said ron irritably walking sorry if disturbed the workings of the ministry of magic 
 
 what are you working on said harry 
 
 a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly trying to standardize cauldron thickness some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year 
 
 change the world that report will said ron front page of the daily prophet i expect cauldron leaks 
 
 percy went slightly pink 
 
 you might sneer ron he said heatedly but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy products that seriously endanger 
 
 yeah yeah all right said ron and he started off upstairs again percy slammed his bedroom door shut as harry hermione and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them it sounded as though mr weasley had told mrs weasley about the toffees 
 
 the room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay the same posters of favorite quidditch team the chudley cannons were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling and the fish tank on the windowsill which had previously held frog spawn now contained one extremely large frog old rat scabbers was here no more but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered letter to harry in privet drive it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly 
 
 shut up pig said ron edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room fred and george are in here with us because bill and charlie are in their room he told harry percy gets to keep his room all to himself because got to work 
 
 er why are you calling that owl pig harry asked ron 
 
 because being stupid said ginny its proper name is pigwidgeon 
 
 yeah and not a stupid name at all said ron sarcastically ginny named him he explained to harry she reckons sweet and i tried to change it but it was too late he answer to anything else so now pig got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes he annoys me too come to that 
 
 pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage hooting shrilly harry knew ron too well to take him seriously he had moaned continually about his old rat scabbers but had been most upset when cat crookshanks appeared to have eaten him 
 
 crookshanks harry asked hermione now 
 
 out in the garden i expect she said he likes chasing gnomes never seen any before 
 
 enjoying work then said harry sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling 
 
 enjoying it said ron darkly i reckon come home if dad make him obsessed just get him onto the subject of his boss according to mr crouchas i was saying to mr crouch mr crouch is of the opinionmr crouch was telling be announcing their engagement any day now 
 
 have you had a good summer harry said hermione did you get our food parcels and everything 
 
 yeah thanks a lot said harry they saved my life those cakes 
 
 and have you heard from ron began but at a look from hermione he fell silent harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about godfather as he was however discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped or believed in his innocence 
 
 i think stopped arguing said hermione to cover the awkward moment because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry shall we go down and help your mum with dinner 
 
 yeah all right said ron the four of them left room and went back downstairs to find mrs weasley alone in the kitchen looking extremely 
 
 eating out in the garden she said when they came in just not room for eleven people in here could you take the plates outside girls bill and charlie are setting up the tables knives and forks please you two she said to ron and harry pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling 
 
 oh for sake she snapped now directing her wand at a dustpan which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor scooping up the potatoes those two she burst out savagely now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard and harry knew she meant fred and george i know going to happen to them i really no ambition unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can 
 
 mrs weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred 
 
 not as though they got brains she continued irritably taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand but wasting them and unless they pull themselves together soon be in real trouble had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together if they carry on the way going end up in front of the improper use of magic office 
 
 mrs weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer which shot open harry and ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it flew across the kitchen and began chopping the potatoes which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan 
 
 i know where we went wrong with them said mrs weasley putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans been the same for years one thing after another and they listen to oh not again 
 
 she had picked up her wand from the table and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse 
 
 one of their fake wands again she shouted how many times have i told them not to leave them lying around 
 
 she grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking 
 
 ron said hurriedly to harry seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer go and help bill and charlie 
 
 they left mrs weasley and headed out the back door into the yard 
 
 they had only gone a few paces when ginger cat crookshanks came pelting out of the garden tail held high in the air chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs harry recognized it instantly as a gnome barely ten inches high its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot trying to reach it meanwhile a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn smashing into each other each attempting to knock the out of the air fred and george were cheering ginny was laughing and hermione was hovering near the hedge apparently torn between amusement and anxiety 
 
 table caught with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off there was a clatter from overhead and they all looked up to see head poking out of a window on the second floor 
 
 will you keep it down he bellowed 
 
 sorry perce said bill grinning the cauldron bottoms coming on 
 
 very badly said percy peevishly and he slammed the window shut chuckling bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass end to end and then with a flick of his wand bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere 
 
 by seven the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of mrs excellent cooking and the nine weasleys harry and hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear sky to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer this was paradise and at first harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie boiled potatoes and salad 
 
 at the far end of the table percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms 
 
 told mr crouch that have it ready by tuesday percy was saying pompously a bit sooner than he expected it but i like to keep on top of things i think be grateful done it in good time i mean its extremely busy in our department just now what with all the arrangements for the world cup just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports ludo bagman 
 
 i like ludo said mr weasley mildly he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup i did him a bit of a favor his brother otto got into a spot of trouble a lawnmower with unnatural powers i smoothed the whole thing over 
 
 oh likable enough of course said percy dismissively but how he ever got to be head of departmentwhen i compare him to mr crouch i see mr crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out happened to them you realize bertha jorkins has been missing for over a month now went on holiday to albania and never came back 
 
 yes i was asking ludo about that said mr weasley frowning he says gotten lost plenty of times before now though must say if it was someone in my department be worried 
 
 oh hopeless all right said percy i hear been shunted from department to department for years much more trouble than worthbut all the same bagman ought to be trying to find her mr crouch has been taking a personal interest she worked in our department at one time you know and i think mr crouch was quite fond of her but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania however percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too as you know got another big event to organize right after the world cup 
 
 percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where harry ron and hermione were sitting you know the one talking about father he raised his voice slightly the one 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work probably an exhibition of cauldrons 
 
 in the middle of the table mrs weasley was arguing with bill about his earring which seemed to be a recent acquisition 
 
 with a horrible great fang on it really bill what do they say at the bank 
 
 mum no one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure said bill patiently 
 
 and your getting silly dear said mrs weasley fingering her wand lovingly i wish let me give it a trim 
 
 i like it said ginny who was sitting beside bill so mum anyway nowhere near as long as professor 
 
 next to mrs weasley fred george and charlie were all talking spiritedly about the world cup 
 
 got to be ireland said charlie thickly through a mouthful of potato they flattened peru in the semifinals 
 
 bulgaria has got viktor krum though said fred 
 
 one decent player ireland has got seven said charlie shortly i wish england had got through that was embarrassing that was 
 
 what happened said harry eagerly regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on privet drive 
 
 went down to transylvania three hundred and ninety to ten said charlie gloomily shocking performance and wales lost to uganda and scotland was slaughtered by luxembourg 
 
 harry had been on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world a firebolt flying came more naturally to harry than anything else in the magical world and he played in the position of seeker on the gryffindor house team 
 
 mr weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream and by the time they had finished moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanks 
 
 ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking then he said very quietly to harry so have you heard from sirius lately 
 
 hermione looked around listening closely 
 
 yeah said harry softly twice he sounds okay i wrote to him yesterday he might write back while here 
 
 he suddenly remembered the reason he had written to sirius and for a moment was on the verge of telling ron and hermione about his scar hurting again and about the dream that had awoken himbut he really want to worry them just now not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful 
 
 look at the time mrs weasley said suddenly checking her wristwatch you really should be in bed the whole lot of you be up at the crack of dawn to get to the cup harry if you leave your school list out get your things for you tomorrow in diagon alley getting everyone there might not be time after the world cup the match went on for five days last time 
 
 wow hope it does this time said harry enthusiastically 
 
 well i certainly said percy sanctimoniously i shudder to think what the state of my would be if i was away from work for five days 
 
 yeah someone might slip dragon dung in it again eh perce said fred 
 
 that was a sample of fertilizer from norway said percy going very red in the face it was nothing personal 
 
 it was fred whispered to harry as they got up from the table we sent it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter five weasleys wizard wheezescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire 
 
 did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet 
 
 yeah said harry straightening up what was it 
 
 toffee said fred brightly george and i invented them and been looking for someone to test them on all summer 
 
 the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers 
 
 you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky he had a broad face which was and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it 
 
 bill got to his feet smiling and also shook hand bill came as something of a surprise harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about and fond of bossing everyone around however bill was there was no other word for it cool he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide 
 
 before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at shoulder he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him 
 
 that funny fred he shouted what on earth did you give that muggle boy 
 
 i give him anything said fred with another evil grin i just dropped was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to 
 
 you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley you knew eat it you knew he was on a diet 
 
 how big did his tongue get george asked eagerly 
 
 it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it 
 
 harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again 
 
 it funny mr weasley shouted that sort of behavior seriously undermines relations i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons 
 
 we give it to him because a muggle said fred indignantly 
 
 no we gave it to him because a great bullying git said george he harry 
 
 yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly 
 
 not the point raged mr weasley you wait until i tell your mother 
 
 tell me what said a voice behind them 
 
 mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion 
 
 oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling then her eyes snapped back to her husband tell me what arthur 
 
 mr weasley hesitated harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was and friend hermione granger the other who was small and was younger sister ginny both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow 
 
 tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice 
 
 nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but had words with them 
 
 what have they done this time said mrs weasley if got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 why you show harry where sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway 
 
 he knows where sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last 
 
 we can all go said hermione pointedly 
 
 oh said ron cottoning on right 
 
 yeah come too said george 
 
 you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley 
 
 harry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories 
 
 what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed 
 
 ron and ginny both laughed although hermione 
 
 mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and room said ron quietly great long price lists for stuff invented joke stuff you know fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff it was brilliant i never knew been inventing all that 
 
 been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny we thought they just liked the noise 
 
 only most of the stuff well all of it really was a bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them told them they allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order furious at them anyway they get as many as she expected 
 
 were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen 
 
 and then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop 
 
 just then a door on the second landing opened and a face poked out wearing glasses and a very annoyed expression 
 
 hi percy said harry 
 
 oh hello harry said percy i was wondering who was making all the noise trying to work in here you know got a report to finish for the office and rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs 
 
 not thundering said ron irritably walking sorry if disturbed the workings of the ministry of magic 
 
 what are you working on said harry 
 
 a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly trying to standardize cauldron thickness some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year 
 
 change the world that report will said ron front page of the daily prophet i expect cauldron leaks 
 
 percy went slightly pink 
 
 you might sneer ron he said heatedly but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy products that seriously endanger 
 
 yeah yeah all right said ron and he started off upstairs again percy slammed his bedroom door shut as harry hermione and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them it sounded as though mr weasley had told mrs weasley about the toffees 
 
 the room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay the same posters of favorite quidditch team the chudley cannons were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling and the fish tank on the windowsill which had previously held frog spawn now contained one extremely large frog old rat scabbers was here no more but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered letter to harry in privet drive it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly 
 
 shut up pig said ron edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room fred and george are in here with us because bill and charlie are in their room he told harry percy gets to keep his room all to himself because got to work 
 
 er why are you calling that owl pig harry asked ron 
 
 because being stupid said ginny its proper name is pigwidgeon 
 
 yeah and not a stupid name at all said ron sarcastically ginny named him he explained to harry she reckons sweet and i tried to change it but it was too late he answer to anything else so now pig got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes he annoys me too come to that 
 
 pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage hooting shrilly harry knew ron too well to take him seriously he had moaned continually about his old rat scabbers but had been most upset when cat crookshanks appeared to have eaten him 
 
 crookshanks harry asked hermione now 
 
 out in the garden i expect she said he likes chasing gnomes never seen any before 
 
 enjoying work then said harry sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling 
 
 enjoying it said ron darkly i reckon come home if dad make him obsessed just get him onto the subject of his boss according to mr crouchas i was saying to mr crouch mr crouch is of the opinionmr crouch was telling be announcing their engagement any day now 
 
 have you had a good summer harry said hermione did you get our food parcels and everything 
 
 yeah thanks a lot said harry they saved my life those cakes 
 
 and have you heard from ron began but at a look from hermione he fell silent harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about godfather as he was however discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped or believed in his innocence 
 
 i think stopped arguing said hermione to cover the awkward moment because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry shall we go down and help your mum with dinner 
 
 yeah all right said ron the four of them left room and went back downstairs to find mrs weasley alone in the kitchen looking extremely 
 
 eating out in the garden she said when they came in just not room for eleven people in here could you take the plates outside girls bill and charlie are setting up the tables knives and forks please you two she said to ron and harry pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling 
 
 oh for sake she snapped now directing her wand at a dustpan which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor scooping up the potatoes those two she burst out savagely now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard and harry knew she meant fred and george i know going to happen to them i really no ambition unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can 
 
 mrs weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred 
 
 not as though they got brains she continued irritably taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand but wasting them and unless they pull themselves together soon be in real trouble had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together if they carry on the way going end up in front of the improper use of magic office 
 
 mrs weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer which shot open harry and ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it flew across the kitchen and began chopping the potatoes which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan 
 
 i know where we went wrong with them said mrs weasley putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans been the same for years one thing after another and they listen to oh not again 
 
 she had picked up her wand from the table and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse 
 
 one of their fake wands again she shouted how many times have i told them not to leave them lying around 
 
 she grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking 
 
 ron said hurriedly to harry seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer go and help bill and charlie 
 
 they left mrs weasley and headed out the back door into the yard 
 
 they had only gone a few paces when ginger cat crookshanks came pelting out of the garden tail held high in the air chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs harry recognized it instantly as a gnome barely ten inches high its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot trying to reach it meanwhile a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn smashing into each other each attempting to knock the out of the air fred and george were cheering ginny was laughing and hermione was hovering near the hedge apparently torn between amusement and anxiety 
 
 table caught with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off there was a clatter from overhead and they all looked up to see head poking out of a window on the second floor 
 
 will you keep it down he bellowed 
 
 sorry perce said bill grinning the cauldron bottoms coming on 
 
 very badly said percy peevishly and he slammed the window shut chuckling bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass end to end and then with a flick of his wand bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere 
 
 by seven the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of mrs excellent cooking and the nine weasleys harry and hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear sky to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer this was paradise and at first harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie boiled potatoes and salad 
 
 at the far end of the table percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms 
 
 told mr crouch that have it ready by tuesday percy was saying pompously a bit sooner than he expected it but i like to keep on top of things i think be grateful done it in good time i mean its extremely busy in our department just now what with all the arrangements for the world cup just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports ludo bagman 
 
 i like ludo said mr weasley mildly he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup i did him a bit of a favor his brother otto got into a spot of trouble a lawnmower with unnatural powers i smoothed the whole thing over 
 
 oh likable enough of course said percy dismissively but how he ever got to be head of departmentwhen i compare him to mr crouch i see mr crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out happened to them you realize bertha jorkins has been missing for over a month now went on holiday to albania and never came back

 oh hopeless all right said percy i hear been shunted from department to department for years much more trouble than worthbut all the same bagman ought to be trying to find her mr crouch has been taking a personal interest she worked in our department at one time you know and i think mr crouch was quite fond of her but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania however percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too as you know got another big event to organize right after the world cup 
 
 percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where harry ron and hermione were sitting you know the one talking about father he raised his voice slightly the one 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work probably an exhibition of cauldrons

 what happened said harry eagerly regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on privet drive 
 
 went down to transylvania three hundred and ninety to ten said charlie gloomily shocking performance and wales lost to uganda and scotland was slaughtered by luxembourg 
 
 harry had been on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world a firebolt flying came more naturally to harry than anything else in the magical world and he played in the position of seeker on the gryffindor house team 
 
 mr weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream and by the time they had finished moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanks 
 
 ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking then he said very quietly to harry so have you heard from sirius lately

 your 
 
 my dear old mum yeah said sirius been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas get downstairs quick before they all wake up again 
 
 but a portrait of your mother doing here harry asked bewildered as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps the others just behind them 
 
 anyone told you this was my parents house said sirius but the last black left so mine now i offered it to dumbledore for headquartersabout the only useful thing been able to do 
 
 harry who had expected a better welcome noted how hard and bitter voice sounded he followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen 
 
 it was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above a cavernous room with rough stone walls most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them littered with rolls of parchment goblets empty wine bottles and a heap of what appeared to be rags mr weasley and his eldest son bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table 
 
 mrs weasley cleared her throat her husband a thin balding man who wore glasses looked around and jumped to his feet 
 
 harry mr weasley said hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously good to see you 
 
 over his shoulder harry saw bill who still wore his long hair in a ponytail hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table 
 
 journey all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once make you come via greenland then 
 
 he tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment oh nosorry 
 
 here dear said mrs weasley sounding exasperated and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand in the flash of light caused by mrs charm harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building 
 
 mrs weasley had seen him looking she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into already overladen arms 
 
 this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings she snapped before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates 
 
 bill took out his wand muttered evanesce and the scrolls vanished 
 
 sit down harry said sirius met mundungus you 
 
 the thing harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged grunting snore then jerked awake 
 
 say mundungus mumbled sleepily i agree with sirius he raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting his droopy bloodshot eyes unfocused 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 the over dung said sirius as they all sat down around him at the table arrived 
 
 eh said mundungus peering bale fully at harry through his matted ginger hair blimey so e as yeah you all right arry 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets still staring at harry and pulled out a grimy black pipe he stuck it in his mouth ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within seconds 
 
 owe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud 
 
 for the last time mundungus called mrs weasley will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when about to eat 
 
 ah said mundungus right sorry molly 
 
 the cloud of smoke vanished as mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered 
 
 and if you want dinner before midnight need a hand mrs weasley said to the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear had a long journey 
 
 what can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forwards 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated looking apprehensive 
 
 erno all right tonks you have a rest too done enough today 
 
 no no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser from which ginny was collecting cutlery 
 
 soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord supervised by mr weasley while mrs weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates more goblets and food from the pantry harry was left at the table with sirius and mundungus who was still blinking at him mournfully 
 
 seen old figgy since he asked 
 
 no said harry i seen anyone 
 
 see i ave left said mundungus leaning forward a pleading note in his voice but i ad a business opportunity 
 
 harry felt something brush against his knees and started but it was only crookshanks ginger cat who wound himself once around legs purring then jumped on to lap and curled up sirius scratched him behind the ears as he turned still to harry 
 
 had a good summer so far 
 
 no been lousy said harry 
 
 for the first time something like a grin flitted across free 
 
 know what complaining about myself 
 
 what said harry incredulously 
 
 personally have welcomed a dementor attack a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely you think had it bad at least been able to get out and about stretch your legs get into a few fights been stuck inside for a month 
 
 how come asked harry frowning 
 
 because the ministry of still after me and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now wormtail will have told him so my big disguise is useless not much i can do for the order of the phoenix or so dumbledore feels 
 
 there was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which sirius uttered name that told harry that sirius too was not very happy with the headmaster eithe harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather 
 
 at least known been going on he said bracingly 
 
 oh yeah said sirius sarcastically listening to reports having to take all his snide hints that out there risking his life while sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the going 
 
 what cleaning asked harry 
 
 trying to make this place fit for human habitation said sirius waving a hand around the dismal kitchen no lived here for ten years not since my dear mother died unless you count her old and gone round the twist cleaned anything in ages 
 
 sirius said mundungus who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation but had been closely examining an empty goblet this solid silver mate 
 
 yes said sirius surveying it with distaste finest silver embossed with the black family crest 
 
 come orf though muttered mundungus polishing it with his cuff 
 
 fredgeorgeno just carry them mrs weasley shrieked 
 
 harry sirius and mundungus looked around and within a split second they had dived away from the table fred and george had bewitched a large cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air towards them the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling its contents everywhere the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where right hand had been seconds before 
 
 for sake screamed mrs weasley there was no need had enough of this just because allowed to use magic now you have to whip your wands out for every tiny little thing 
 
 we were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mean to 
 
 harry and sirius were both laughing mundungus who had toppled backwards off his chair was swearing as he got to his feet crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness 
 
 boys mr weasley said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your right supposed to show a sense of responsibility now come of age 
 
 none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble mrs weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again bill feel the need to apparate every few feet charlie charm everything he met percy 
 
 she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly wooden 
 
 eat said bill quickly 
 
 it looks wonderful molly said lupin ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food then mrs weasley turned to sirius 
 
 been meaning to tell you sirius something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keeps rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it out 
 
 whatever you like said sirius indifferently 
 
 the curtains in there are full of doxys too mrs weasley went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow 
 
 i look forward to it said sirius harry heard the sarcasm in his voice but he was not sure that anyone else did 
 
 opposite harry tonks was entertaining hermione and ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in bedroom her nose swelled to a protuberance that resembled shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment because hermione and ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses 
 
 do that one like a pig snout tonks 
 
 tonks obliged and harry looking up had the fleeting impression that a female dudley was grinning at him from across the table 
 
 mr weasley bill and lupin were having an intense discuss on about goblins 
 
 not giving anything away yet said bill i still work out whether or not they believe back course they might prefer not to take sides at all keep out of it 
 
 sure never go over to said mr weasley shaking his head suffered losses too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottingham 
 
 i think it depends what offered said lupin and not talking about gold if offered the freedoms been denying them for centuries going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok bill 
 
 feeling pretty at the moment said bill he stopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a those goblins never got their gold from him you know 
 
 a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of words fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seats 
 
 and then choked mundungus tears running down his face and then if believe it e says to me e says ere dung where didja get all them toads from cos some son of a gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next so be wanting some more then and if believe me lads the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for a lot what e paid in the first place 
 
 i think we need to hear any more of your business dealings thank you very much mundungus said mrs weasley sharply as ron slumped forwards on to the table howling with laughter 
 
 beg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eyes and winking at harry but you know will nicked em orf warty harris in the first place so i really doing nothing wrong 
 
 i know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said mrs weasley coldly 
 
 fred and george buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer george was hiccoughing for some reason mrs weasley threw a very nasty look at sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding harry looked round at his godfather 
 
 molly approve of mundungus said sirius in an undertone 
 
 how come in the order harry said very quietly 
 
 useful sirius muttered knows all the crookswell he would seeing as one himself but also very loyal to dumbledore who helped him out of a tight spot once it pays to have someone like dung around he hears things we but molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far she forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you 
 
 three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight which was saying something as the jeans had once been as he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation mr weasley was leaning back in his chair looking replete and relaxed tonks was yawning widely her nose now back to normal and ginny who had lured crookshanks out from under the dresser was sitting on the floor rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase 
 
 nearly time for bed i think said mrs weasley with a yawn 
 
 not just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know surprised at you i thought the first thing do when you got here would be to start asking questions about voldemort 
 
 the atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity harry associated with the arrival of dementors where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed it was now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of name lupin who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary 
 
 i did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said not allowed in the order so 
 
 and quite right said mrs weasley too young 
 
 she was sitting bolt upright in her chair her fists clenched an its arms every trace of drowsiness gone 
 
 since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions asked sirius been trapped in that muggle house for a month got the right to know been happen 
 
 hang on interrupted george loudly 
 
 how come harry gets his questions answered said fred angrily 
 
 been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you told us a single stinking thing said george 
 
 too young not in the order said fred in a voice that sounded uncannily like his not even of age 
 
 not my fault you been told what the doing said sirius calmly your parents decision harry on the other hand 
 
 not down to you to decide good for harry said mrs weasley sharply the expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous you forgotten what dumbledore said i suppose 
 
 which bit sirius asked politely but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight 
 
 the bit about not telling harry more than he needs to know said mrs weasley placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words 
 
 ron hermione fred and heads swivelled from sirius to mrs weasley as though they were following a tennis rally ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open eyes were fixed on sirius 
 
 i intend to tell him more than he needs to know molly said sirius but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back again there was a collective shudder around the table at the name he has more right than most to 
 
 not a member of the order of the phoenix said mrs weasley only fifteen and 
 
 and dealt with as much as most in the order said sirius and more than some 
 
 no denying what done said mrs weasley her voice rising her fists trembling on the arms of her chair but still 
 
 not a child said sirius impatiently 
 
 not an adult either said mrs weasley the colour rising in her cheeks not james sirius 
 
 perfectly clear who he is thanks molly said sirius coldly 
 
 not sure you are said mrs weasley sometimes the way you talk about him as though you think got your best friend back 
 
 wrong with that said harry 
 
 wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said mrs weasley her eyes still boring into sirius you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it 
 
 meaning an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice rising 
 
 meaning you have been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and 
 
 leave my instructions from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudly 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley rounding on her husband arthur back me up 
 
 mr weasley did not speak at once he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply 
 
 dumbledore knows the position has changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters 
 
 yes but a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes 
 
 personally said lupin quietly looking away from sirius at last as mrs weasley turned quickly to him hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally i think it better that harry gets the factsnot all the facts molly but the general picturefrom us rather than a garbled version from others 
 
 his expression was mild but harry felt sure lupin at least knew that some extendable ears had survived mrs purge 
 
 well said mrs weasley breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see going to be overruled just say this dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking as someone who has best interests at heart 
 
 not your son said sirius quietly 
 
 as good as said mrs weasley fiercely who else has he got 
 
 got me 
 
 yes said mrs weasley her lip curling the thing is been rather difficult for you to look after him while been locked up in azkaban it 
 
 sirius started to rise from his chair 
 
 molly not the only person at this table who cares about harry said lupin sharply sirius sit down 
 
 mrs weasleys lower lip was trembling sirius sank slowly back into his chair his face white 
 
 i think harry ought to be allowed a say in this lupin continued old enough to decide for himself 
 
 i want to know been going on harry said at once 
 
 he did not look at mrs weasley he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling sirius was right he was not a child 
 
 very well said mrs weasley her voice cracking ginnyronhermionefredgeorgei want you out of this kitchen now 
 
 there was instant uproar 
 
 of age fred and george bellowed together 
 
 if allowed why i shouted ron 
 
 mum i want to hear wailed ginny 
 
 no shouted mrs weasley standing up her eyes overbright i absolutely forbid 
 
 molly you stop fred and george said mr weasley wearily they are of age 
 
 still at school 
 
 but legally adults now said mr weasley in the same tired voice 
 
 mrs weasley was now scarlet in the face 
 
 ioh all right then fred and george can stay but ron 
 
 tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly you he added uncertainly meeting eyes 
 
 for a split second harry considered telling ron that he tell him a single word that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it but the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other 
 
 course i will harry said 
 
 ron and hermione beamed 
 
 fine shouted mrs weasley fine ginnybed 
 
 ginny did not go quietly they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs and when she reached the hall mrs blacks shrieks were added to the din lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm it was only after he had returned closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again that sirius spoke 
 
 ok harry what do you want to know 
 
 harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month 
 
 voldemort he said ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name he doing been trying to watch the muggle news and there been anything that looks like him yet no funny deaths or anything 
 
 because there been any funny deaths yet said sirius not as far as we know anyway and we know quite a lot 
 
 more than he thinks we do anyway said lupin 
 
 how come stopped killing people harry asked he knew voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone 
 
 because he want to draw attention to himself said sirius it would be dangerous for him his comeback come off quite the way he wanted it to you see he messed it up 
 
 or rather you messed it up for him said lupin with a satisfied smile 
 
 how harry asked perplexed 
 
 you supposed to survive said sirius nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know come back but you survived to bear witness 
 
 and the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was dumbledore said lupin and you made sure dumbledore knew at once 
 
 how has that helped harry asked 
 
 are you kidding said bill incredulously dumbledore was the only one was ever scared of 
 
 thanks to you dumbledore was able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned said sirius 
 
 so the order been doing said harry looking around at them all 
 
 working as hard as we can to make sure voldemort carry out his plans said sirius 
 
 how know what his plans are harry asked quickly 
 
 got a shrewd idea said lupin and shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate 
 
 so what does dumbledore reckon planning 
 
 well firstly he wants to build up his army again said sirius in the old days he had huge numbers at his command witches and wizards bullied or bewitched into following him his faithful death eaters a great variety of dark creatures you heard him planning to recruit the giants well be just one of the groups after certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eaters 
 
 so trying to stop him getting more followers 
 
 doing our best said lupin 
 
 how 
 
 well the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that really has returned to put them on their guard said bill proving tricky though 
 
 why 
 
 because of the attitude said tonks you saw cornelius fudge after came back harry well he shifted his position at all absolutely refusing to believe happened 
 
 but why said harry desperately he being so stupid if dumbledore 
 
 ah well put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wry smile dumbledore 
 
 fudge is frightened of him you see said tonks sadly 
 
 frightened of dumbledore said harry incredulously 
 
 frightened of what up to said mr weasley fudge thinks plotting to overthrow him he thinks dumbledore wants to be minister for magic 
 
 but dumbledore want 
 
 of course he said mr weasley never wanted the job even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when millicent bagnold retired fudge came to power instead but never quite forgotten how much popular support dumbledore had even though dumbledore never applied for the job 
 
 deep down fudge knows much cleverer than he is a much more powerful wizard and in the early days of his ministry he was forever asking dumbledore for help and advice said lupin but it seems become fond of power and much more confident he loves being minister for magic and managed to convince himself that the clever one and simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it 
 
 how can he think that said harry angrily how can he think dumbledore would just make it all upthat make it all up 
 
 because accepting that back would mean trouble like the ministry had to cope with for nearly fourteen years said sirius bitterly fudge just bring himself to face it so much more comfortable to convince himself lying to destabilise him 
 
 you see the problem said lupin while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort hard to convince people back especially as they really want to believe it in the first place more the leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what calling so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware happened and that makes them easy targets for the death eaters if using the imperius curse 
 
 but telling people you said harry looking around at mr weasley sirius bill mundungus lupin and tonks letting people know back 
 
 they all smiled humourlessly 
 
 well as everyone thinks a mad and the put a ten thousand galleon price on my head i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets can i said sirius restlessly 
 
 and not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community said lupin an occupational hazard of being a werewolf 
 
 tonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry if they started shooting their mouths off said sirius and very important for us to have spies inside the ministry because you can bet voldemort will have them 
 
 managed to convince a couple of people though said mr weasley tonks here for too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage kingsley been a real asset too in charge of the hunt for sirius so been feeding the ministry information that sirius is in tibet 
 
 but if none of you are putting the news out that back harry began 
 
 who said none of us are putting the news out said sirius why think in such trouble 
 
 what mean harry asked 
 
 trying to discredit him said lupin you see the daily prophet last week they reported that been voted out of the chairmanship of the international confederation of wizards because getting old and losing his grip but not true he was voted out by ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing return demoted him from chief warlock on the the wizard high courtand talking about taking away his order of merlin first class too 
 
 but dumbledore says he care what they do as long as they take him off the chocolate frog cards said bill grinning 
 
 no laughing matter said mr weasley sharply if he carries on defying the ministry like this he could end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is to have dumbledore locked up while knows out there and wise to what up to going to go cautiously if out of the waywell will have a clear field 
 
 but if trying to recruit more death eaters bound to get out that come back it asked harry desperately 
 
 voldemort march up to houses and bang on their front doors harry said sirius he tricks jinxes and blackmails them at operating in secret in any case gathering followers is only one thing interested in got other plans too plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed and concentrating on those for the moment 
 
 he after apart from followers harry asked swiftly he thought he saw sirius and lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before sirius answered stuff he can only get by stealth 
 
 when harry continued to look puzzled sirius said like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 when he was powerful before 
 
 yes 
 
 like what kind of weapon said harry something worse than the avada kedavra 
 
 enough 
 
 mrs weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door harry noticed her return from taking ginny upstairs her arms were crossed and she looked furious 
 
 i want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermione 
 
 you boss us fred began 
 
 watch me snarled mrs weasley she was trembling slightly as she looked at sirius given harry plenty of information any more and you might just as well induct him into the order straightaway 
 
 why not said harry quickly join i want to join i want to fight 
 
 no 
 
 it was not mrs weasley who spoke this time but lupin 
 
 the order is comprised only of overage wizards he said wizards who have left school he added as fred and george opened their mouths there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think right sirius said enough 
 
 sirius but did not argue mrs weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and herrnione one by one they stood up and harry recognising defeat followed suit 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the order of the phoenixcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 your 
 
 my dear old mum yeah said sirius been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas get downstairs quick before they all wake up again 
 
 but a portrait of your mother doing here harry asked bewildered as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps the others just behind them 
 
 anyone told you this was my parents house said sirius but the last black left so mine now i offered it to dumbledore for headquartersabout the only useful thing been able to do 
 
 harry who had expected a better welcome noted how hard and bitter voice sounded he followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen 
 
 it was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above a cavernous room with rough stone walls most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them littered with rolls of parchment goblets empty wine bottles and a heap of what appeared to be rags mr weasley and his eldest son bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table 
 
 mrs weasley cleared her throat her husband a thin balding man who wore glasses looked around and jumped to his feet 
 
 harry mr weasley said hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously good to see you 
 
 over his shoulder harry saw bill who still wore his long hair in a ponytail hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table 
 
 journey all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once make you come via greenland then 
 
 he tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment oh nosorry 
 
 here dear said mrs weasley sounding exasperated and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand in the flash of light caused by mrs charm harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building 
 
 mrs weasley had seen him looking she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into already overladen arms 
 
 this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings she snapped before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates 
 
 bill took out his wand muttered evanesce and the scrolls vanished 
 
 sit down harry said sirius met mundungus you 
 
 the thing harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged grunting snore then jerked awake 
 
 say mundungus mumbled sleepily i agree with sirius he raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting his droopy bloodshot eyes unfocused 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 the over dung said sirius as they all sat down around him at the table arrived 
 
 eh said mundungus peering bale fully at harry through his matted ginger hair blimey so e as yeah you all right arry 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets still staring at harry and pulled out a grimy black pipe he stuck it in his mouth ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within seconds 
 
 owe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud 
 
 for the last time mundungus called mrs weasley will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when about to eat 
 
 ah said mundungus right sorry molly 
 
 the cloud of smoke vanished as mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered 
 
 and if you want dinner before midnight need a hand mrs weasley said to the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear had a long journey 
 
 what can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forwards 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated looking apprehensive 
 
 erno all right tonks you have a rest too done enough today 
 
 no no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser from which ginny was collecting cutlery 
 
 soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord supervised by mr weasley while mrs weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates more goblets and food from the pantry harry was left at the table with sirius and mundungus who was still blinking at him mournfully 
 
 seen old figgy since he asked 
 
 no said harry i seen anyone 
 
 see i ave left said mundungus leaning forward a pleading note in his voice but i ad a business opportunity 
 
 harry felt something brush against his knees and started but it was only crookshanks ginger cat who wound himself once around legs purring then jumped on to lap and curled up sirius scratched him behind the ears as he turned still to harry 
 
 had a good summer so far 
 
 no been lousy said harry 
 
 for the first time something like a grin flitted across free 
 
 know what complaining about myself 
 
 what said harry incredulously 
 
 personally have welcomed a dementor attack a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely you think had it bad at least been able to get out and about stretch your legs get into a few fights been stuck inside for a month 
 
 how come asked harry frowning 
 
 because the ministry of still after me and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now wormtail will have told him so my big disguise is useless not much i can do for the order of the phoenix or so dumbledore feels 
 
 there was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which sirius uttered name that told harry that sirius too was not very happy with the headmaster eithe harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather 
 
 at least known been going on he said bracingly 
 
 oh yeah said sirius sarcastically listening to reports having to take all his snide hints that out there risking his life while sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the going 
 
 what cleaning asked harry 
 
 trying to make this place fit for human habitation said sirius waving a hand around the dismal kitchen no lived here for ten years not since my dear mother died unless you count her old and gone round the twist cleaned anything in ages 
 
 sirius said mundungus who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation but had been closely examining an empty goblet this solid silver mate 
 
 yes said sirius surveying it with distaste finest silver embossed with the black family crest 
 
 come orf though muttered mundungus polishing it with his cuff 
 
 fredgeorgeno just carry them mrs weasley shrieked 
 
 harry sirius and mundungus looked around and within a split second they had dived away from the table fred and george had bewitched a large cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air towards them the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling its contents everywhere the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where right hand had been seconds before 
 
 for sake screamed mrs weasley there was no need had enough of this just because allowed to use magic now you have to whip your wands out for every tiny little thing 
 
 we were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mean to 
 
 harry and sirius were both laughing mundungus who had toppled backwards off his chair was swearing as he got to his feet crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness 
 
 boys mr weasley said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your right supposed to show a sense of responsibility now come of age 
 
 none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble mrs weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again bill feel the need to apparate every few feet charlie charm everything he met percy 
 
 she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly wooden 
 
 eat said bill quickly 
 
 it looks wonderful molly said lupin ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food then mrs weasley turned to sirius 
 
 been meaning to tell you sirius something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keeps rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it out 
 
 whatever you like said sirius indifferently 
 
 the curtains in there are full of doxys too mrs weasley went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow 
 
 i look forward to it said sirius harry heard the sarcasm in his voice but he was not sure that anyone else did 
 
 opposite harry tonks was entertaining hermione and ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in bedroom her nose swelled to a protuberance that resembled shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment because hermione and ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses 
 
 do that one like a pig snout tonks 
 
 tonks obliged and harry looking up had the fleeting impression that a female dudley was grinning at him from across the table 
 
 mr weasley bill and lupin were having an intense discuss on about goblins 
 
 not giving anything away yet said bill i still work out whether or not they believe back course they might prefer not to take sides at all keep out of it 
 
 sure never go over to said mr weasley shaking his head suffered losses too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottingham 
 
 i think it depends what offered said lupin and not talking about gold if offered the freedoms been denying them for centuries going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok bill 
 
 feeling pretty at the moment said bill he stopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a those goblins never got their gold from him you know 
 
 a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of words fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seats 
 
 and then choked mundungus tears running down his face and then if believe it e says to me e says ere dung where didja get all them toads from cos some son of a gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next so be wanting some more then and if believe me lads the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for a lot what e paid in the first place 
 
 i think we need to hear any more of your business dealings thank you very much mundungus said mrs weasley sharply as ron slumped forwards on to the table howling with laughter 
 
 beg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eyes and winking at harry but you know will nicked em orf warty harris in the first place so i really doing nothing wrong 
 
 i know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said mrs weasley coldly 
 
 fred and george buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer george was hiccoughing for some reason mrs weasley threw a very nasty look at sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding harry looked round at his godfather 
 
 molly approve of mundungus said sirius in an undertone 
 
 how come in the order harry said very quietly 
 
 useful sirius muttered knows all the crookswell he would seeing as one himself but also very loyal to dumbledore who helped him out of a tight spot once it pays to have someone like dung around he hears things we but molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far she forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you 
 
 three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight which was saying something as the jeans had once been as he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation mr weasley was leaning back in his chair looking replete and relaxed tonks was yawning widely her nose now back to normal and ginny who had lured crookshanks out from under the dresser was sitting on the floor rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase 
 
 nearly time for bed i think said mrs weasley with a yawn 
 
 not just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know surprised at you i thought the first thing do when you got here would be to start asking questions about voldemort 
 
 the atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity harry associated with the arrival of dementors where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed it was now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of name lupin who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary 
 
 i did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said not allowed in the order so 
 
 and quite right said mrs weasley too young 
 
 she was sitting bolt upright in her chair her fists clenched an its arms every trace of drowsiness gone 
 
 since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions asked sirius been trapped in that muggle house for a month got the right to know been happen 
 
 hang on interrupted george loudly 
 
 how come harry gets his questions answered said fred angrily 
 
 been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you told us a single stinking thing said george 
 
 too young not in the order said fred in a voice that sounded uncannily like his not even of age 
 
 not my fault you been told what the doing said sirius calmly your parents decision harry on the other hand 
 
 not down to you to decide good for harry said mrs weasley sharply the expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous you forgotten what dumbledore said i suppose 
 
 which bit sirius asked politely but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight 
 
 the bit about not telling harry more than he needs to know said mrs weasley placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words 
 
 ron hermione fred and heads swivelled from sirius to mrs weasley as though they were following a tennis rally ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open eyes were fixed on sirius 
 
 i intend to tell him more than he needs to know molly said sirius but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back again there was a collective shudder around the table at the name he has more right than most to 
 
 not a member of the order of the phoenix said mrs weasley only fifteen and 
 
 and dealt with as much as most in the order said sirius and more than some 
 
 no denying what done said mrs weasley her voice rising her fists trembling on the arms of her chair but still 
 
 not a child said sirius impatiently 
 
 not an adult either said mrs weasley the colour rising in her cheeks not james sirius 
 
 perfectly clear who he is thanks molly said sirius coldly 
 
 not sure you are said mrs weasley sometimes the way you talk about him as though you think got your best friend back 
 
 wrong with that said harry 
 
 wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said mrs weasley her eyes still boring into sirius you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it 
 
 meaning an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice rising 
 
 meaning you have been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and 
 
 leave my instructions from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudly 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley rounding on her husband arthur back me up 
 
 mr weasley did not speak at once he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply 
 
 dumbledore knows the position has changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters 
 
 yes but a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes 
 
 personally said lupin quietly looking away from sirius at last as mrs weasley turned quickly to him hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally i think it better that harry gets the factsnot all the facts molly but the general picturefrom us rather than a garbled version from others 
 
 his expression was mild but harry felt sure lupin at least knew that some extendable ears had survived mrs purge 
 
 well said mrs weasley breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see going to be overruled just say this dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking as someone who has best interests at heart 
 
 not your son said sirius quietly 
 
 as good as said mrs weasley fiercely who else has he got 
 
 got me 
 
 yes said mrs weasley her lip curling the thing is been rather difficult for you to look after him while been locked up in azkaban it 
 
 sirius started to rise from his chair 
 
 molly not the only person at this table who cares about harry said lupin sharply sirius sit down 
 
 mrs weasleys lower lip was trembling sirius sank slowly back into his chair his face white 
 
 i think harry ought to be allowed a say in this lupin continued old enough to decide for himself 
 
 i want to know been going on harry said at once 
 
 he did not look at mrs weasley he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling sirius was right he was not a child 
 
 very well said mrs weasley her voice cracking ginnyronhermionefredgeorgei want you out of this kitchen now 
 
 there was instant uproar 
 
 of age fred and george bellowed together 
 
 if allowed why i shouted ron 
 
 mum i want to hear wailed ginny 
 
 no shouted mrs weasley standing up her eyes overbright i absolutely forbid 
 
 molly you stop fred and george said mr weasley wearily they are of age 
 
 still at school 
 
 but legally adults now said mr weasley in the same tired voice 
 
 mrs weasley was now scarlet in the face 
 
 ioh all right then fred and george can stay but ron 
 
 tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly you he added uncertainly meeting eyes 
 
 for a split second harry considered telling ron that he tell him a single word that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it but the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other 
 
 course i will harry said 
 
 ron and hermione beamed 
 
 fine shouted mrs weasley fine ginnybed 
 
 ginny did not go quietly they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs and when she reached the hall mrs blacks shrieks were added to the din lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm it was only after he had returned closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again that sirius spoke 
 
 ok harry what do you want to know 
 
 harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month 
 
 voldemort he said ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name he doing been trying to watch the muggle news and there been anything that looks like him yet no funny deaths or anything 
 
 because there been any funny deaths yet said sirius not as far as we know anyway and we know quite a lot 
 
 more than he thinks we do anyway said lupin 
 
 how come stopped killing people harry asked he knew voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone 
 
 because he want to draw attention to himself said sirius it would be dangerous for him his comeback come off quite the way he wanted it to you see he messed it up 
 
 or rather you messed it up for him said lupin with a satisfied smile 
 
 how harry asked perplexed 
 
 you supposed to survive said sirius nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know come back but you survived to bear witness 
 
 and the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was dumbledore said lupin and you made sure dumbledore knew at once 
 
 how has that helped harry asked 
 
 are you kidding said bill incredulously dumbledore was the only one was ever scared of 
 
 thanks to you dumbledore was able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned said sirius 
 
 so the order been doing said harry looking around at them all 
 
 working as hard as we can to make sure voldemort carry out his plans said sirius 
 
 how know what his plans are harry asked quickly 
 
 got a shrewd idea said lupin and shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate 
 
 so what does dumbledore reckon planning 
 
 well firstly he wants to build up his army again said sirius in the old days he had huge numbers at his command witches and wizards bullied or bewitched into following him his faithful death eaters a great variety of dark creatures you heard him planning to recruit the giants well be just one of the groups after certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eaters 
 
 so trying to stop him getting more followers 
 
 doing our best said lupin 
 
 how 
 
 well the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that really has returned to put them on their guard said bill proving tricky though 
 
 why 
 
 because of the attitude said tonks you saw cornelius fudge after came back harry well he shifted his position at all absolutely refusing to believe happened 
 
 but why said harry desperately he being so stupid if dumbledore 
 
 ah well put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wry smile dumbledore 
 
 fudge is frightened of him you see said tonks sadly 
 
 frightened of dumbledore said harry incredulously 
 
 frightened of what up to said mr weasley fudge thinks plotting to overthrow him he thinks dumbledore wants to be minister for magic 
 
 but dumbledore want 
 
 of course he said mr weasley never wanted the job even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when millicent bagnold retired fudge came to power instead but never quite forgotten how much popular support dumbledore had even though dumbledore never applied for the job 
 
 deep down fudge knows much cleverer than he is a much more powerful wizard and in the early days of his ministry he was forever asking dumbledore for help and advice said lupin but it seems become fond of power and much more confident he loves being minister for magic and managed to convince himself that the clever one and simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it 
 
 how can he think that said harry angrily how can he think dumbledore would just make it all upthat make it all up 
 
 because accepting that back would mean trouble like the ministry had to cope with for nearly fourteen years said sirius bitterly fudge just bring himself to face it so much more comfortable to convince himself lying to destabilise him 
 
 you see the problem said lupin while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort hard to convince people back especially as they really want to believe it in the first place more the leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what calling so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware happened and that makes them easy targets for the death eaters if using the imperius curse 
 
 but telling people you said harry looking around at mr weasley sirius bill mundungus lupin and tonks letting people know back 
 
 they all smiled humourlessly 
 
 well as everyone thinks a mad and the put a ten thousand galleon price on my head i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets can i said sirius restlessly 
 
 and not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community said lupin an occupational hazard of being a werewolf 
 
 tonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry if they started shooting their mouths off said sirius and very important for us to have spies inside the ministry because you can bet voldemort will have them 
 
 managed to convince a couple of people though said mr weasley tonks here for too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage kingsley been a real asset too in charge of the hunt for sirius so been feeding the ministry information that sirius is in tibet 
 
 but if none of you are putting the news out that back harry began 
 
 who said none of us are putting the news out said sirius why think in such trouble 
 
 what mean harry asked 
 
 trying to discredit him said lupin you see the daily prophet last week they reported that been voted out of the chairmanship of the international confederation of wizards because getting old and losing his grip but not true he was voted out by ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing return demoted him from chief warlock on the the wizard high courtand talking about taking away his order of merlin first class too 
 
 but dumbledore says he care what they do as long as they take him off the chocolate frog cards said bill grinning 
 
 no laughing matter said mr weasley sharply if he carries on defying the ministry like this he could end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is to have dumbledore locked up while knows out there and wise to what up to going to go cautiously if out of the waywell will have a clear field 
 
 but if trying to recruit more death eaters bound to get out that come back it asked harry desperately 
 
 voldemort march up to houses and bang on their front doors harry said sirius he tricks jinxes and blackmails them at operating in secret in any case gathering followers is only one thing interested in got other plans too plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed and concentrating on those for the moment 
 
 he after apart from followers harry asked swiftly he thought he saw sirius and lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before sirius answered stuff he can only get by stealth 
 
 when harry continued to look puzzled sirius said like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 when he was powerful before 
 
 yes 
 
 like what kind of weapon said harry something worse than the avada kedavra 
 
 enough 
 
 mrs weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door harry noticed her return from taking ginny upstairs her arms were crossed and she looked furious 
 
 i want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermione 
 
 you boss us fred began 
 
 watch me snarled mrs weasley she was trembling slightly as she looked at sirius given harry plenty of information any more and you might just as well induct him into the order straightaway 
 
 why not said harry quickly join i want to join i want to fight 
 
 no 
 
 it was not mrs weasley who spoke this time but lupin 
 
 the order is comprised only of overage wizards he said wizards who have left school he added as fred and george opened their mouths there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think right sirius said enough 
 
 sirius but did not argue mrs weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and herrnione one by one they stood up and harry recognising defeat followed suit 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter five an excess of phlegmcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boots and rusty cauldrons harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed dumbledore knocked three times and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window 
 
 there said a nervous voice he recognized as mrs declare yourself 
 
 it is i dumbledore bringing harry 
 
 the door opened at once there stood mrs weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown 
 
 harry dear gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning 
 
 we were lucky said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold slughorn proved much more persuadable than i had expected doing of course ah hello nymphadora 
 
 harry looked around and saw that mrs weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour a young witch with a pale face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands 
 
 hello professor she said wotcher harry 
 
 hi tonks 
 
 harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of hair 
 
 better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders thanks for the tea and sympathy molly 
 
 please leave on my account said dumbledore courteously i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour 
 
 no no i need to get going said tonks not meeting eyes night 
 
 dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and are coming 
 
 no really molly thanks anyway goodnight 
 
 tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air harry noticed that mrs weasley looked troubled 
 
 well i shall see you at hogwarts harry said dumbledore take care of yourself molly your servant 
 
 he made mrs weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot mrs weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance 
 
 like ron she sighed looking him up and down both of you look as though had stretching jinxes put on you i swear grown four inches since i last bought him school robes are you hungry harry 
 
 yeah i am said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was 
 
 sit down dear knock something up 
 
 as harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there purring 
 
 so here he asked happily as he tickled crookshanks behind the ears 
 
 oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mrs weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once in bed of course we expect you for hours here you are 
 
 she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mrs weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup 
 
 bread dear 
 
 thanks mrs weasley 
 
 she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs weasley sat down opposite him 
 
 so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job 
 
 harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak 
 
 he taught arthur and me said mrs weasley he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as dumbledore i think did you like him 
 
 his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a jerk of the head 
 
 i know what you mean said mrs weasley nodding wisely of course he can be charming when he wants to be but never liked him much the littered with old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur seem to think he was enough of a highflier well that just shows you even slughorn makes mistakes i know whether told you in any of his letters only just happened but been promoted 
 
 it could not have been clearer that mrs weasley had been bursting to say this 
 
 harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering 
 
 great he gasped 
 
 you are sweet beamed mrs weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news yes rufus scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects a big job got ten people reporting to him now 
 
 what exactly 
 
 well you see in all the panic about odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against and the death eaters you can imagine the kind of thing protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off well in the main the perpetrators are just people like mundungus hotelier never done an honest work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater so you see a very important job and i tell him just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish mrs weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been harry suggesting that it was natural to miss 
 
 is mr weasley still at work harry asked 
 
 yes he is as a matter of fact a tiny bit late he said be back around midnight 
 
 she turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table harry recognized it at once it had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that mrs weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril 
 
 been like that for a while now said mrs weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since came back into the open i suppose in mortal danger now i think it can be just our family but i know anyone else got a clock like this so i check oh 
 
 with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the face mr hand had switched to traveling 
 
 coming 
 
 and sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door mrs weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly arthur is that you 
 
 yes came mr weary voice but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear ask the question 
 
 oh honestly 
 
 molly 
 
 all right all right what is your dearest ambition 
 
 to find out how airplanes stay up 
 
 mrs weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut 
 
 molly got to ask you your question first 
 
 arthur really this is just silly 
 
 what do you like me to call you when alone together 
 
 even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mrs weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl 
 
 mollywobbles whispered a mortified mrs weasley into the crack at the edge of the door 
 
 correct said mr weasley now you can let me in 
 
 mrs weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding wizard wearing spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak 
 
 i still see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mrs weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you 
 
 i know dear but ministry procedure and i have to set an example something smells good onion soup 
 
 mr weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table 
 
 harry we expect you until morning 
 
 they shook hands and mr weasley dropped into the chair beside harry as mrs weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too 
 
 thanks molly been a tough night some started selling just sling them around your neck and be able to change your appearance at will a hundred thousand disguises all for ten galleons 
 
 and what really happens when you put them on 
 
 mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies as if st have enough to do already 
 
 it sounds like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny said mrs weasley hesitantly are you sure 
 
 of course i am said mr weasley the boys do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection 
 
 so is that why late 
 
 no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there 
 
 harry stifled a yawn behind his hand 
 
 bed said an undeceived mrs weasley at once got fred and room all ready for you have it to yourself 
 
 why where are they 
 
 oh in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as so busy said mrs weasley i must say i approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business come on dear your trunks already up there 
 
 night mr weasley said harry pushing back his chair crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room 
 
 harry said mr weasley 
 
 harry saw mrs weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen all the hands were once again at mortal peril 
 
 fred and bedroom was on the second floor mrs weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought was gunpowder a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood school trunk the room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse 
 
 hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting harry bade mrs weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds there was something hard inside the pillowcase he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep 
 
 seconds later or so it seemed to harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other 
 
 wuzzgoinon 
 
 we know you were here already said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head 
 
 ron hit him said a voice reproachfully 
 
 hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though i he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him 
 
 all right 
 
 never been better said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows you 
 
 not bad said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it when did you get here only just told us 
 
 about one this morning 
 
 were the muggles all right did they treat you okay 
 
 same as usual said harry as hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they talk to me much but i like it better that way you hermione 
 
 oh fine said hermione who was scrutinizing harry as though he was sickening for something he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said the time have i missed breakfast 
 
 worry about that bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said ron rolling his eyes so been going on 
 
 nothing much just been stuck at my aunt and i 
 
 come off it said ron been off with dumbledore 
 
 it that exciting he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement his horace slughorn 
 
 oh said ron looking disappointed we thought 
 
 hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed 
 
 we thought be something like that 
 
 you did said harry amused 
 
 yeah yeah now umbridge has left obviously we need a new defense against the dark arts teacher we so er he like 
 
 he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said harry something wrong hermione 
 
 she was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile 
 
 no of course not so um did slughorn seem like be a good teacher 
 
 dunno said harry he be worse than umbridge can he 
 
 i know someone worse than umbridge said a voice from the doorway younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable hi harry 
 
 up with you ron asked 
 
 her said ginny plonking herself down on bed driving me mad 
 
 she done now asked hermione sympathetically 
 
 the way she talks to me think i was about three 
 
 i know said hermione dropping her voice so full of herself 
 
 harry was astonished to hear hermione talking about mrs weasley like this and could not blame ron for saying angrily you two lay off her for five seconds 
 
 oh right defend her snapped ginny we all know you get enough of her 
 
 this seemed an odd comment to make about mother starting to feel that he was missing something harry said who are you 
 
 but his question was answered before he could finish it the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor 
 
 a young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless she was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow to complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray 
 
 arry she said in a throaty voice eet as been too long 
 
 as she swept over the threshold toward him mrs weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross 
 
 there was no need to bring up the tray i was just about to do it myself 
 
 eet was no trouble said fleur delacour setting the tray across knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn i ave been longing to see im you remember my seester gabrielle she never stops talking about arry potter she will be delighted to see you again 
 
 oh is she here too harry croaked 
 
 no no silly boy said fleur with a tinkling laugh i mean next summer when we but do you not know 
 
 her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at mrs weasley who said we got around to telling him yet 
 
 fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs weasley across the face 
 
 bill and i are going to be married 
 
 oh said harry blankly he could not help noticing how mrs weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one gaze wow er congratulations 
 
 she swooped down upon him and kissed him again 
 
 bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and i only work at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is family properly i was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens well enjoy your breakfast arry 
 
 with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her 
 
 mrs weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah 
 
 mum hates her said ginny quietly 
 
 i do not hate her said mrs weasley in a cross whisper i just think hurried into this engagement all 
 
 known each other a year said ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door 
 
 well not very long i know why happened of course all this uncertainty with coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so rushing all sorts of decisions normally take time over it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center 
 
 including you and dad said ginny slyly 
 
 yes well your father and i were made for each other what was the point in waiting said mrs weasley whereas bill and fleur well what have they really got in common a hardworking sort of person whereas 
 
 a cow said ginny nodding but not that a he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour i expect why gone for phlegm 
 
 stop calling her that ginny said mrs weasley sharply as harry and hermione laughed well better get on eat your eggs while warm harry 
 
 looking careworn she left the room ron still seemed slightly he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water 
 
 you get used to her if staying in the same house harry asked 
 
 well you do said ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then 
 
 pathetic said hermione furiously striding away from ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall 
 
 you really want her around forever ginny asked ron incredulously when he merely shrugged she said well going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything 
 
 she going to manage that asked harry 
 
 she keeps trying to get tonks round for dinner i think hoping bill will fall for tonks instead i hope he does much rather have her in the family 
 
 yeah work said ron sarcastically listen no bloke in his right going to fancy tonks when around i mean tonks is when she doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but 
 
 a damn sight nicer than phlegm said ginny 
 
 and more intelligent an auror said hermione from the corner 
 
 not stupid she was good enough to enter the triwizard tournament said harry 
 
 not you as well said hermione bitterly 
 
 i suppose you like the way phlegm says arry do you asked ginny scornfully 
 
 no said harry wishing he spoken i was just saying phlegm i mean fleur 
 
 much rather have tonks in the family said ginny at least a laugh 
 
 she been much of a laugh lately said ron every time seen her looked more like moaning myrtle 
 
 not fair snapped hermione she still got over what happened you know i mean he was her cousin 
 
 heart sank they had arrived at sirius he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation 
 
 tonks and sirius barely knew each other said ron sirius was in azkaban half her life and before that their families never met 
 
 not the point said hermione she thinks it was her limit he died 
 
 how does she work that one out asked harry in spite of himself 
 
 well she was fighting bellatrix lestrange she i think she feels that if only she had finished her off bellatrix have killed sirius 
 
 stupid said ron 
 
 guilt said hermione i know tried to talk her round but still really down actually having trouble with her metamorphosing 
 
 with her 
 
 she change her appearance like she used to explained hermione i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something 
 
 i know that could happen said harry 
 
 nor did i said hermione but i suppose if really depressed 
 
 the door opened again and mrs weasley popped her head in ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch 
 
 talking to this lot said ginny outraged 
 
 now said mrs weasley and withdrew 
 
 she only wants me there so she have to be alone with phlegm said ginny crossly she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina 
 
 you lot had better come down quickly too she said as she left 
 
 harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast hermione was peering into fred and boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at harry ron who was now helping himself to toast was still gazing dreamily at the door 
 
 this hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope 
 
 dunno said ron but if fred and george left it here probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful 
 
 your mum said the going well said harry said fred and george have got a real flair for business 
 
 an understatement said ron raking in the galleons i wait to see the place we been to diagon alley yet because mum says got to be there for extra security and been really busy at work but it sounds excellent 
 
 and what about percy asked harry the weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family is he talking to your mum and dad again 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 but he knows your dad was right all along now about voldemort being back 
 
 dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said hermione i heard him telling your mum ron 
 
 sounds like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say said ron 
 
 going to be giving me private lessons this year said harry conversationally 
 
 ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped 
 
 you kept that quiet said ron 
 
 i only just remembered said harry honestly he told me last night in your broom shed 
 
 blimey private lessons with dumbledore said ron looking impressed i wonder why 
 
 his voice tailed away harry saw him and hermione exchange looks harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed dumbledore had said to do it why not now he fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said i know exactly why going to be giving me lessons but i think it must be because of the prophecy 
 
 neither ron nor hermione spoke harry had the impression that both had frozen he continued still speaking to his fork you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry 
 
 nobody knows what it said though said hermione quickly it got smashed 
 
 although the prophet says began ron but hermione said shh 
 
 the prophets got it right said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed that glass ball that smashed the only record of the prophecy i heard the whole thing in office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me from what it said harry took a deep breath it looks like the one got to finish off voldemort at least it said neither of us could live while the other survives 
 
 the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment then there was a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke 
 
 hermione shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash 
 
 hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye 
 
 i squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped 
 
 and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope 
 
 worry said ron who was plainly trying not to laugh fix that good at healing minor injuries 
 
 oh well never mind that now said hermione hastily harry oh harry 
 
 she sat down on the edge of his bed again 
 
 we wondered after we got back from the ministry obviously we want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this oh harry she stared at him then whispered are you scared 
 
 not as much as i was said harry when i first heard it i was but now it seems as though i always knew have to face him in the end 
 
 when we heard dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy said ron eagerly and we were kind of right we he be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner waste his time he must think got a chance 
 
 true said hermione i wonder what teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably powerful countercurses 
 
 harry did not really listen a warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them 
 
 and evasive enchantments generally concluded hermione well at least you know one lesson be having this year one more than ron and me i wonder when our results will come 
 
 be long now been a month said ron 
 
 hang on said harry as another part of last conversation came back to him i think dumbledore said our results would be arriving today 
 
 today shrieked hermione today but why you oh my god you should have said 
 
 she leapt to her feet 
 
 going to see whether any owls have come 
 
 but when harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mrs weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda 
 
 it just budge mrs weasley was saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the helpmate open at bruises cuts and abrasions this has always worked before i just understand it 
 
 be fred and idea of a funny joke making sure it come off said ginny 
 
 but got to come off squeaked hermione i go around looking like this forever 
 
 you dear find an antidote worry said mrs weasley soothingly 
 
 bill told me ow fred and george are very amusing said fleur smiling serenely 
 
 yes i can hardly breathe for laughing snapped hermione 
 
 she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together 
 
 mrs weasley quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning 
 
 yes dear have noticed said mrs weasley patiently but barely nine still plenty of time 
 
 i know i messed up ancient runes muttered hermione feverishly i definitely made at least one serious mistranslation and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back 
 
 hermione will you shut up not the only one nervous barked ron and when got your eleven outstanding 
 
 said hermione flapping her hands hysterically i know failed everything 
 
 what happens if we fail harry asked the room at large but it was again hermione who answered 
 
 we discuss our options with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term 
 
 stomach squirmed he wished he had eaten less breakfast 
 
 at beauxbatons said fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing things i think eet was better we sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then 
 
 words were drowned in a scream hermione was pointing through the kitchen window three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time 
 
 definitely owls said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window 
 
 and there are three of them said harry hastening to her other side 
 
 one for each of us said hermione in a terrified whisper oh no oh no oh no 
 
 she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbows 
 
 the owls were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope 
 
 oh no squealed hermione 
 
 mrs weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window one two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line all three of them lifted their right legs 
 
 harry moved forward the letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle he untied it with fumbling fingers to his left ron was trying to detach his own results to his right hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble 
 
 nobody in the kitchen spoke at last harry managed to detach the envelope he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside 
 
 ordinary wizarding level results

 harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading it was all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else he ran his finger down the grades he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectations at potions and best of all he had achieved outstanding at defense against the dark arts 
 
 he looked around hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron was looking delighted 
 
 only failed divination and history of magic and who cares about them he said happily to harry here swap 
 
 harry glanced down grades there were no outstandings there 
 
 knew be top at defense against the dark arts said ron punching harry on the shoulder done all right we 
 
 well done said mrs weasley proudly ruffling hair seven more than fred and george got together 
 
 hermione said ginny tentatively for hermione still turned around how did you do 
 
 inot bad said hermione in a small voice 
 
 oh come off it said ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand yep ten outstandings and one exceeds expectations at defense against the dark arts he looked down at her actually disappointed you 
 
 hermione shook her head but harry laughed 
 
 well students now grinned ron mum are there any more sausages 
 
 harry looked back down at his results they were as good as he could have hoped for he felt just one tiny twinge of regret this was the end of his ambition to become an auror he had not secured the required potions grade he had known all along that he but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e 
 
 it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he really think of anything else he would like to be moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago neither can live while the other survives he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill voldemort

lionfish nov chapter five an excess of phlegmcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boots and rusty cauldrons harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed dumbledore knocked three times and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window 
 
 there said a nervous voice he recognized as mrs declare yourself 
 
 it is i dumbledore bringing harry 
 
 the door opened at once there stood mrs weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown 
 
 harry dear gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning 
 
 we were lucky said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold slughorn proved much more persuadable than i had expected doing of course ah hello nymphadora 
 
 harry looked around and saw that mrs weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour a young witch with a pale face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands 
 
 hello professor she said wotcher harry 
 
 hi tonks 
 
 harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of hair 
 
 better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders thanks for the tea and sympathy molly 
 
 please leave on my account said dumbledore courteously i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour 
 
 no no i need to get going said tonks not meeting eyes night 
 
 dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and are coming 
 
 no really molly thanks anyway goodnight 
 
 tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air harry noticed that mrs weasley looked troubled 
 
 well i shall see you at hogwarts harry said dumbledore take care of yourself molly your servant 
 
 he made mrs weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot mrs weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance 
 
 like ron she sighed looking him up and down both of you look as though had stretching jinxes put on you i swear grown four inches since i last bought him school robes are you hungry harry 
 
 yeah i am said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was 
 
 sit down dear knock something up 
 
 as harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there purring 
 
 so here he asked happily as he tickled crookshanks behind the ears 
 
 oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mrs weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once in bed of course we expect you for hours here you are 
 
 she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mrs weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup 
 
 bread dear 
 
 thanks mrs weasley 
 
 she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs weasley sat down opposite him 
 
 so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job 
 
 harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak 
 
 he taught arthur and me said mrs weasley he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as dumbledore i think did you like him 
 
 his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a jerk of the head 
 
 i know what you mean said mrs weasley nodding wisely of course he can be charming when he wants to be but never liked him much the littered with old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur seem to think he was enough of a highflier well that just shows you even slughorn makes mistakes i know whether told you in any of his letters only just happened but been promoted 
 
 it could not have been clearer that mrs weasley had been bursting to say this 
 
 harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering 
 
 great he gasped 
 
 you are sweet beamed mrs weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news yes rufus scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects a big job got ten people reporting to him now 
 
 what exactly 
 
 well you see in all the panic about odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against and the death eaters you can imagine the kind of thing protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off well in the main the perpetrators are just people like mundungus hotelier never done an honest work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater so you see a very important job and i tell him just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish mrs weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been harry suggesting that it was natural to miss 
 
 is mr weasley still at work harry asked 
 
 yes he is as a matter of fact a tiny bit late he said be back around midnight 
 
 she turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table harry recognized it at once it had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that mrs weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril 
 
 been like that for a while now said mrs weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since came back into the open i suppose in mortal danger now i think it can be just our family but i know anyone else got a clock like this so i check oh 
 
 with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the face mr hand had switched to traveling 
 
 coming 
 
 and sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door mrs weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly arthur is that you 
 
 yes came mr weary voice but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear ask the question 
 
 oh honestly 
 
 molly 
 
 all right all right what is your dearest ambition 
 
 to find out how airplanes stay up 
 
 mrs weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut 
 
 molly got to ask you your question first 
 
 arthur really this is just silly 
 
 what do you like me to call you when alone together 
 
 even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mrs weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl 
 
 mollywobbles whispered a mortified mrs weasley into the crack at the edge of the door 
 
 correct said mr weasley now you can let me in 
 
 mrs weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding wizard wearing spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak 
 
 i still see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mrs weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you 
 
 i know dear but ministry procedure and i have to set an example something smells good onion soup 
 
 mr weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table 
 
 harry we expect you until morning 
 
 they shook hands and mr weasley dropped into the chair beside harry as mrs weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too 
 
 thanks molly been a tough night some started selling just sling them around your neck and be able to change your appearance at will a hundred thousand disguises all for ten galleons 
 
 and what really happens when you put them on 
 
 mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies as if st have enough to do already 
 
 it sounds like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny said mrs weasley hesitantly are you sure 
 
 of course i am said mr weasley the boys do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection 
 
 so is that why late 
 
 no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there 
 
 harry stifled a yawn behind his hand 
 
 bed said an undeceived mrs weasley at once got fred and room all ready for you have it to yourself 
 
 why where are they 
 
 oh in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as so busy said mrs weasley i must say i approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business come on dear your trunks already up there 
 
 night mr weasley said harry pushing back his chair crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room 
 
 harry said mr weasley 
 
 harry saw mrs weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen all the hands were once again at mortal peril 
 
 fred and bedroom was on the second floor mrs weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought was gunpowder a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood school trunk the room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse 
 
 hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting harry bade mrs weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds there was something hard inside the pillowcase he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep 
 
 seconds later or so it seemed to harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other 
 
 wuzzgoinon 
 
 we know you were here already said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head 
 
 ron hit him said a voice reproachfully 
 
 hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though i he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him 
 
 all right 
 
 never been better said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows you 
 
 not bad said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it when did you get here only just told us 
 
 about one this morning 
 
 were the muggles all right did they treat you okay 
 
 same as usual said harry as hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they talk to me much but i like it better that way you hermione 
 
 oh fine said hermione who was scrutinizing harry as though he was sickening for something he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said the time have i missed breakfast 
 
 worry about that bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said ron rolling his eyes so been going on 
 
 nothing much just been stuck at my aunt and i 
 
 come off it said ron been off with dumbledore 
 
 it that exciting he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement his horace slughorn 
 
 oh said ron looking disappointed we thought 
 
 hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed 
 
 we thought be something like that 
 
 you did said harry amused 
 
 yeah yeah now umbridge has left obviously we need a new defense against the dark arts teacher we so er he like 
 
 he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said harry something wrong hermione 
 
 she was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile 
 
 no of course not so um did slughorn seem like be a good teacher 
 
 dunno said harry he be worse than umbridge can he 
 
 i know someone worse than umbridge said a voice from the doorway younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable hi harry 
 
 up with you ron asked 
 
 her said ginny plonking herself down on bed driving me mad 
 
 she done now asked hermione sympathetically 
 
 the way she talks to me think i was about three 
 
 i know said hermione dropping her voice so full of herself 
 
 harry was astonished to hear hermione talking about mrs weasley like this and could not blame ron for saying angrily you two lay off her for five seconds 
 
 oh right defend her snapped ginny we all know you get enough of her 
 
 this seemed an odd comment to make about mother starting to feel that he was missing something harry said who are you 
 
 but his question was answered before he could finish it the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor 
 
 a young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless she was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow to complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray 
 
 arry she said in a throaty voice eet as been too long 
 
 as she swept over the threshold toward him mrs weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross 
 
 there was no need to bring up the tray i was just about to do it myself 
 
 eet was no trouble said fleur delacour setting the tray across knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn i ave been longing to see im you remember my seester gabrielle she never stops talking about arry potter she will be delighted to see you again 
 
 oh is she here too harry croaked 
 
 no no silly boy said fleur with a tinkling laugh i mean next summer when we but do you not know 
 
 her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at mrs weasley who said we got around to telling him yet 
 
 fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs weasley across the face 
 
 bill and i are going to be married 
 
 oh said harry blankly he could not help noticing how mrs weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one gaze wow er congratulations 
 
 she swooped down upon him and kissed him again 
 
 bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and i only work at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is family properly i was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens well enjoy your breakfast arry 
 
 with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her 
 
 mrs weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah 
 
 mum hates her said ginny quietly 
 
 i do not hate her said mrs weasley in a cross whisper i just think hurried into this engagement all 
 
 known each other a year said ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door 
 
 well not very long i know why happened of course all this uncertainty with coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so rushing all sorts of decisions normally take time over it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center 
 
 including you and dad said ginny slyly 
 
 yes well your father and i were made for each other what was the point in waiting said mrs weasley whereas bill and fleur well what have they really got in common a hardworking sort of person whereas 
 
 a cow said ginny nodding but not that a he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour i expect why gone for phlegm 
 
 stop calling her that ginny said mrs weasley sharply as harry and hermione laughed well better get on eat your eggs while warm harry 
 
 looking careworn she left the room ron still seemed slightly he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water 
 
 you get used to her if staying in the same house harry asked 
 
 well you do said ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then 
 
 pathetic said hermione furiously striding away from ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall 
 
 you really want her around forever ginny asked ron incredulously when he merely shrugged she said well going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything 
 
 she going to manage that asked harry 
 
 she keeps trying to get tonks round for dinner i think hoping bill will fall for tonks instead i hope he does much rather have her in the family 
 
 yeah work said ron sarcastically listen no bloke in his right going to fancy tonks when around i mean tonks is when she doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but 
 
 a damn sight nicer than phlegm said ginny 
 
 and more intelligent an auror said hermione from the corner 
 
 not stupid she was good enough to enter the triwizard tournament said harry 
 
 not you as well said hermione bitterly 
 
 i suppose you like the way phlegm says arry do you asked ginny scornfully 
 
 no said harry wishing he spoken i was just saying phlegm i mean fleur 
 
 much rather have tonks in the family said ginny at least a laugh 
 
 she been much of a laugh lately said ron every time seen her looked more like moaning myrtle 
 
 not fair snapped hermione she still got over what happened you know i mean he was her cousin 
 
 heart sank they had arrived at sirius he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation 
 
 tonks and sirius barely knew each other said ron sirius was in azkaban half her life and before that their families never met 
 
 not the point said hermione she thinks it was her limit he died 
 
 how does she work that one out asked harry in spite of himself 
 
 well she was fighting bellatrix lestrange she i think she feels that if only she had finished her off bellatrix have killed sirius 
 
 stupid said ron 
 
 guilt said hermione i know tried to talk her round but still really down actually having trouble with her metamorphosing 
 
 with her 
 
 she change her appearance like she used to explained hermione i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something 
 
 i know that could happen said harry 
 
 nor did i said hermione but i suppose if really depressed 
 
 the door opened again and mrs weasley popped her head in ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch 
 
 talking to this lot said ginny outraged 
 
 now said mrs weasley and withdrew 
 
 she only wants me there so she have to be alone with phlegm said ginny crossly she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina 
 
 you lot had better come down quickly too she said as she left 
 
 harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast hermione was peering into fred and boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at harry ron who was now helping himself to toast was still gazing dreamily at the door 
 
 this hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope 
 
 dunno said ron but if fred and george left it here probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful 
 
 your mum said the going well said harry said fred and george have got a real flair for business 
 
 an understatement said ron raking in the galleons i wait to see the place we been to diagon alley yet because mum says got to be there for extra security and been really busy at work but it sounds excellent 
 
 and what about percy asked harry the weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family is he talking to your mum and dad again 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 but he knows your dad was right all along now about voldemort being back 
 
 dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said hermione i heard him telling your mum ron 
 
 sounds like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say said ron 
 
 going to be giving me private lessons this year said harry conversationally 
 
 ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped 
 
 you kept that quiet said ron 
 
 i only just remembered said harry honestly he told me last night in your broom shed 
 
 blimey private lessons with dumbledore said ron looking impressed i wonder why 
 
 his voice tailed away harry saw him and hermione exchange looks harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed dumbledore had said to do it why not now he fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said i know exactly why going to be giving me lessons but i think it must be because of the prophecy 
 
 neither ron nor hermione spoke harry had the impression that both had frozen he continued still speaking to his fork you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry 
 
 nobody knows what it said though said hermione quickly it got smashed 
 
 although the prophet says began ron but hermione said shh 
 
 the prophets got it right said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed that glass ball that smashed the only record of the prophecy i heard the whole thing in office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me from what it said harry took a deep breath it looks like the one got to finish off voldemort at least it said neither of us could live while the other survives 
 
 the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment then there was a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke 
 
 hermione shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash 
 
 hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye 
 
 i squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped 
 
 and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope 
 
 worry said ron who was plainly trying not to laugh fix that good at healing minor injuries 
 
 oh well never mind that now said hermione hastily harry oh harry 
 
 she sat down on the edge of his bed again 
 
 we wondered after we got back from the ministry obviously we want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this oh harry she stared at him then whispered are you scared 
 
 not as much as i was said harry when i first heard it i was but now it seems as though i always knew have to face him in the end 
 
 when we heard dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy said ron eagerly and we were kind of right we he be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner waste his time he must think got a chance 
 
 true said hermione i wonder what teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably powerful countercurses 
 
 harry did not really listen a warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them 
 
 and evasive enchantments generally concluded hermione well at least you know one lesson be having this year one more than ron and me i wonder when our results will come 
 
 be long now been a month said ron 
 
 hang on said harry as another part of last conversation came back to him i think dumbledore said our results would be arriving today 
 
 today shrieked hermione today but why you oh my god you should have said 
 
 she leapt to her feet 
 
 going to see whether any owls have come 
 
 but when harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mrs weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda 
 
 it just budge mrs weasley was saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the helpmate open at bruises cuts and abrasions this has always worked before i just understand it 
 
 be fred and idea of a funny joke making sure it come off said ginny 
 
 but got to come off squeaked hermione i go around looking like this forever 
 
 you dear find an antidote worry said mrs weasley soothingly 
 
 bill told me ow fred and george are very amusing said fleur smiling serenely 
 
 yes i can hardly breathe for laughing snapped hermione 
 
 she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together 
 
 mrs weasley quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning 
 
 yes dear have noticed said mrs weasley patiently but barely nine still plenty of time 
 
 i know i messed up ancient runes muttered hermione feverishly i definitely made at least one serious mistranslation and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back 
 
 hermione will you shut up not the only one nervous barked ron and when got your eleven outstanding 
 
 said hermione flapping her hands hysterically i know failed everything 
 
 what happens if we fail harry asked the room at large but it was again hermione who answered 
 
 we discuss our options with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term 
 
 stomach squirmed he wished he had eaten less breakfast 
 
 at beauxbatons said fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing things i think eet was better we sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then 
 
 words were drowned in a scream hermione was pointing through the kitchen window three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time 
 
 definitely owls said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window 
 
 and there are three of them said harry hastening to her other side 
 
 one for each of us said hermione in a terrified whisper oh no oh no oh no 
 
 she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbows 
 
 the owls were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope 
 
 oh no squealed hermione 
 
 mrs weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window one two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line all three of them lifted their right legs 
 
 harry moved forward the letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle he untied it with fumbling fingers to his left ron was trying to detach his own results to his right hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble 
 
 nobody in the kitchen spoke at last harry managed to detach the envelope he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside 
 
 ordinary wizarding level results

 harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading it was all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else he ran his finger down the grades he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectations at potions and best of all he had achieved outstanding at defense against the dark arts 
 
 he looked around hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron was looking delighted 
 
 only failed divination and history of magic and who cares about them he said happily to harry here swap 
 
 harry glanced down grades there were no outstandings there 
 
 knew be top at defense against the dark arts said ron punching harry on the shoulder done all right we 
 
 well done said mrs weasley proudly ruffling hair seven more than fred and george got together 
 
 hermione said ginny tentatively for hermione still turned around how did you do 
 
 inot bad said hermione in a small voice 
 
 oh come off it said ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand yep ten outstandings and one exceeds expectations at defense against the dark arts he looked down at her actually disappointed you 
 
 hermione shook her head but harry laughed 
 
 well students now grinned ron mum are there any more sausages 
 
 harry looked back down at his results they were as good as he could have hoped for he felt just one tiny twinge of regret this was the end of his ambition to become an auror he had not secured the required potions grade he had known all along that he but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e 
 
 it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he really think of anything else he would like to be moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago neither can live while the other survives he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill voldemort

 the half blood prince

 hagrid 
 
 harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand he could not understand where voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead he crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was hagrid 
 
 hagrid hagrid talk to me c 
 
 but the dark mass did not stir 
 
 whos there is it potter are you harry potter 
 
 harry did not recognize the mans voice then a woman shouted theyve crashed ted crashed in the garden 
 
 harrys head was swimming 
 
 hagrid he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled 
 
 the next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm his missing tooth had been regrown the scar on his forehead was still throbbing 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room his rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy a man was watching harry anxiously 
 
 hagrids fine son said the man the wifes seeing to him now how are you feeling anything else broken ive fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm im ted by the way ted tonks c doras father 
 
 harry sat up too quickly lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy 
 
 voldemort c 
 
 easy now said ted tonks placing a hand on harrys shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions that was a nasty crash you just had what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions 
 
 no said harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound death eaters loads of them c we were chased c 
 
 death eaters said ted sharply what dyou mean death eaters i thought they didnt know you were being moved tonight i thought c 
 
 they knew said harry 
 
 ted tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above 
 
 well we know our protective charms hold then dont we they shouldnt be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction 
 
 now harry understood why voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the orders charms he only hoped they would continue to work he imagined voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what harry visualized as a great transparent bubble 
 
 he swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive he had barely stood up however when a door opened and hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive 
 
 harry 
 
 knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs blimey harry how did yeh get out o that i thought we were both goners 
 
 yeah me too i cant believe c 
 
 harry broke off he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind hagrid 
 
 you he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty 
 
 your wands here son said ted tapping it on harrys arm it fell right beside you i picked it upand thats my wife youre shouting at 
 
 oh im c im sorry 
 
 as she moved forward into the room mrs tonkss resemblance to her sister bellatrix became much less pronounced her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder nevertheless she looked a little haughty after harrys exclamation 
 
 what happened to our daughter she asked hagrid said you were ambushed where is nymphadora 
 
 i dont know said harry we dont know what happened to anyone else 
 
 she and ted exchanged looks a mixture of fear and guilt gripped harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault he had consented to the plan given them his hair 
 
 the portkey he said remembering all of a sudden weve got to get back to the burrow and find out c then well be able to send you word or c or tonks will once shes c 
 
 dorall be ok dromeda said ted she knows her stuff shes been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors the portkeys through here he added to harry its supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it 
 
 yeah we do said harry he seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders i c 
 
 he looked at mrs tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and insincere 
 
 ill tell tonks c dora c to send word when she thanks for patching us up thanks for everything i c 
 
 he was glad to leave the room and follow ted tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel 
 
 there you go son thats the portkey 
 
 mr tonks was pointing to a small hairbrush lying on the dressing table 
 
 thanks said harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave 
 
 wait a moment said hagrid looking around harry wheres hedwig 
 
 she she got hit said harry 
 
 the realization crashed over him he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes the owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the dursleys 
 
 hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder 
 
 never mind he said gruffly never mind she had a great old life c 
 
 hagrid said ted tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time 
 
 with a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the portkey as he and hagrid hurtled away from mr tonks second later harrys feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the burrow he heard screams throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush harry stood up swaying slightly and saw mrs weasley and ginny running down the steps by the back door as hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet 
 
 harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others cried mrs weasley 
 
 what dyou mean isnt anyone else back harry panted 
 
 the answer was clearly etched in mrs weasleys pale face 
 
 the death eaters were waiting for us harry told her we were surrounded the moment we took off c they knew it was tonight c i dont know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then voldemort caught up with us c 
 
 he could hear the note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but c 
 
 thank goodness youre all right she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved 
 
 havent go any brandy have yeh molly asked hagrid a little shakily fer medicinal purposes 
 
 she could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house harry knew that she wanted to hide her face he turned to ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once 
 
 ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby and that one she pointed at an ancient sneaker should have been dad and freds they were supposed to be second you and hagrid were third and she checked her watch if they made it george and lupin aught to be back in about a minute 
 
 mrs weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to hagrid he uncorked it and drank it straight down in one 
 
 mum shouted ginny pointing to a spot several feet away 
 
 a blue light had appeared in the darkness it grew larger and brighter and lupin and george appeared spinning and then falling harry knew immediately that there was something wrong lupin was supporting george who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood 
 
 harry ran forward and seized georges legs together he and lupin carried george into the house and through the kitchen to the living room where they laid him on the sofa as the lamplight fell across georges head ginny gasped and harrys stomach lurched one of georges ears was missing the side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood 
 
 no sooner had mrs weasley bent over her son that lupin grabbed harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door 
 
 oi said hagrid indignantly le go of him le go of harry 
 
 lupin ignored him 
 
 what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts he said giving harry a small shake answer me 
 
 a c a grindylow in a tank wasnt it 
 
 lupin released harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard 
 
 wha was tha about roared hagrid 
 
 im sorry harry but i had to check said lupin tersely weve been betrayed voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan you might have been an impostor 
 
 so why aren you checkin me panted hagrid still struggling with the door 
 
 youre said lupin looking up at hagrid the polyjuice potion is designed for human use only 
 
 none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight said harry the idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didnt know which one i was in the beginning if hed been in on the plan hed have known from the start i was the one with hagrid 
 
 voldemort caught up with you said lupin sharply what happened how did you escape 
 
 harry explained how the death eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned voldemort who had appeared just before he and hagrid had reached the sanctuary of tonkss parents 
 
 they recognized you but how what had you done 
 
 i harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion i saw stan shunpike you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of c well he doesnt know what hes doing does he he must be imperiused 
 
 lupin looked aghast 
 
 harry the time for disarming is past these people are trying to capture and kill you at least stun if you arent prepared to kill 
 
 we were hundreds of feet up stans not himself and if i stunned him and hed fallen hed have died the same as if id used avada kedavra expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago harry added defiantly lupin was reminding him of the sneering hufflepuff zacharias smith who had jeered at harry for wanting to teach dumbledores army how to disarm 
 
 yes harry said lupin with painful restraint and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under the imminent threat of death repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal 
 
 so you think i should have killed stan shunpike said harry angrily 
 
 of course not said lupin but the death eaters c frankly most people c would have expected you to attack back expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so 
 
 lupin was making harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him 
 
 i wont blast people out of my way just because theyre there said harry thats voldemorts job 
 
 lupins retort was lost finally succeeding in squeezing through the door hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies harry addressed lupin again 
 
 will george be okay 
 
 all lupins frustration with harry seemed to drain away at the question 
 
 i think so although theres no chance of replacing his ear not when its been cursed off c 
 
 there was a scuffling from outside lupin dived for the back door harry leapt over hagrids legs and sprinted into the yard 
 
 two figures had appeared in the yard and as harry ran toward them he realized they were hermione now returning to her normal appearance and kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger hermione flung herself into harrys arms but kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them over hermiones shoulder harry saw him raise his wand and point it at lupins chest 
 
 the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us 
 
 harry is the best hope we have trust him said lupin calmly 
 
 kingsley turned his wand on harry but lupin said its him ive checked 
 
 all right all right said kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak but somebody betrayed us they knew they knew it was tonight 
 
 so it seems replied lupin but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys 
 
 small comfort snarled kingsley who else is back 
 
 only harry hagrid george and me 
 
 hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand 
 
 what happened to you lupin asked kingsley 
 
 followed by five injured two mightve killed one kingsley reeled off and we saw as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly remus he can c 
 
 fly supplied harry i saw him too he came after hagrid and me 
 
 so thats why he left to follow you said kingsley i couldnt understand why hed vanished but what made him change targets 
 
 harry behaved a little too kindly to stan shunpike said lupin 
 
 stan repeated hermione but i thought he was in azkaban 
 
 kingsley let out a mirthless laugh 
 
 hermione theres obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up traverss hood fell off when i cursed him hes supposed to be inside too but what happened to you remus wheres george 
 
 he lost an ear said lupin 
 
 lost an c repeated hermione in a high voice 
 
 snapes work said lupin 
 
 snape shouted harry you didnt say c 
 
 he lost his hood during the chase sectumsempra was always a specialty of snapes i wish i could say id paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood 
 
 silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky there was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends where was ron where were fred and mr weasley where were bill fleur tonks and mundungus 
 
 harry give us a hand called hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again glad of something to do harry pulled him free the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where mrs weasley and ginny were still tending to george mrs weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight harry saw a clean gaping hole where georges ear had been 
 
 how is he 
 
 mrs weasley looked around and said i cant make it grow back not when its been removed by dark magic but it couldve been so much worse hes alive 
 
 yeah said harry thank god 
 
 did i hear someone else in the yard ginny asked 
 
 hermione and kingsley said harry 
 
 thank goodness ginny whispered they looked at each other harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that mrs weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen 
 
 ill prove who i am kingsley after ive seen my son now back off if you know whats good for you 
 
 harry had never heard mr weasley shout like that before he burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew fred right behind him both pale but uninjured 
 
 arthur sobbed mrs weasley oh thank goodness 
 
 how is he 
 
 mr weasley dropped to his knees beside george for the first time since harry had known him fred seemed to be lost for words he gaped over the back of the sofa at his twins wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing 
 
 perhaps roused by the sound of fred and their fathers arrival george stirred 
 
 how do you feel georgie whispered mrs weasley 
 
 georges fingers groped for the side of his head 
 
 saintlike he murmured 
 
 whats wrong with him croaked fred looking terrified is his mind affected 
 
 saintlike repeated george opening his eyes and looking up at his brother you see im holy holey fred geddit 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever color flooded freds pale face 
 
 pathetic he told george pathetic with the whole wide world of humor before you you go for holey 
 
 ah well said george grinning at his mother youll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum 
 
 he looked around 
 
 hi harry c you are harry right 
 
 yeah i am said harry moving closer to the sofa 
 
 well at least we got you back okay said george why arent ron and bill huddled round my sickbed 
 
 theyre not back yet george said mrs weasley georges grin faded harry glanced at ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside as they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice 
 
 ron and tonks should be back by now they didnt have a long journey auntie muriels not that far from here 
 
 harry said nothing he had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat as they walked down the back steps into the dark yard ginny took his hand 
 
 kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned harry was reminded of uncle vernon pacing the living room a million years ago hagrid hermione and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence none of them looked around when harry and ginny joined their silent vigil 
 
 the minutes stretched into what might as well have been years the slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing order members might leap unscathed from its leaves c 
 
 and then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground c 
 
 its them screamed hermione 
 
 tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere 
 
 remus tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into lupins arms his face was set and white he seemed unable to speak ron tripped dazedly toward harry and hermione 
 
 youre okay he mumbled before hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly 
 
 i thought c i thought c 
 
 m all right said ron patting her on the back m fine 
 
 ron was great said tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on lupin wonderful stunned one of the death eaters straight to the head and when youre aiming at a moving target from a flying broom c 
 
 you did said hermione gazing up at ron with her arms still around his neck 
 
 always the tone of surprise he said a little grumpily breaking free are we the last back 
 
 no said ginny were still waiting for bill and fleur and and mundungus im going to tell mum and dad youre okay ron c 
 
 she ran back inside 
 
 so what kept you what happened lupin sounded almost angry at tonks 
 
 bellatrix said tonks she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me i just wish id got her i owe bellatrix but we definitely injured rodolphus then we got to rons auntie muriels and we missed our portkey and she was fussing over us c 
 
 a muscle was jumping in lupins jaw he nodded but seemed unable to say anything else 
 
 so what happened to you lot tonks asked turning to harry hermione and kingsley 
 
 they recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of bill fleur and mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore 
 
 im going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago said kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky let me know when theyre back 
 
 lupin nodded with a wave to the others kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate harry thought he heard the faintest pop as kingsley disapparated just beyond the burrows boundaries 
 
 mr and mrs weasley came racing down the back steps ginny behind them both parents hugged ron before turning to lupin and tonks 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley for our sons 
 
 dont be silly molly said tonks at once 
 
 hows george asked lupin 
 
 whats wrong with him piped up ron 
 
 hes lost c 
 
 but the end of mrs weasleys sentence was drowned in a general outcry a thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them bill and fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt 
 
 bill thank god thank god c 
 
 mrs weasley ran forward but the hug bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory looking directly at his father he said dead 
 
 nobody spoke nobody moved harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever 
 
 we saw it said bill fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window it happened just after we broke out of the circle and dung were close by us they were heading north too voldemort c he can fly c went straight for them dung panicked i heard him cry out tried to stop him but he disapparated voldemorts curse hit full in the face he fell backward off his broom and c there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail c 
 
 bills voice broke 
 
 of course you couldnt have done anything said lupin 
 
 they all stood looking at each other harry could not quite comprehend it dead it could not be so tough so brave the consummate survivor 
 
 at last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point of waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed mr and mrs weasley back into the burrow and into the living room where fred and george were laughing together 
 
 whats wrong said fred scanning their faces as they entered whats happened whos c 
 
 said mr weasley dead 
 
 the twins grins turned to grimaces of shock nobody seemed to know what to do tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief she had been close to harry knew his favorite and his protge at the ministry of magic hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his handkerchief 
 
 bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of and some glasses 
 
 here he said and with a wave of his wand eh sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft 
 
 they all said and drank 
 
 echoed hagrid a little late with a hiccup the firewhisky seared harrys throat it seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage 
 
 so mundungus disappeared said lupin who had drained his own glass in one 
 
 the atmosphere changed at once everybody looked tense watching lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear 
 
 i know what youre thinking said bill and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didnt they but mundungus cant have betrayed us they didnt know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case youve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery why wouldnt he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked its as simple as that he didnt want to come in the first place but made him and went straight for them it was enough to make anyone panic 
 
 acted exactly as expected him to sniffed tonks said hed expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors he chased first and when mundungus gave them away he switched to kingsley 
 
 yes and zat eez all very good snapped fleur but still eet does not explain ow zey know we were moving arry tonight does eet somebody must ave been careless somebody let slip ze date to an outsider it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan 
 
 she glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her nobody did the only sound to break the silence was that of hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief harry glanced at hagrid who had just risked his own life to save harrys c hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragons egg 
 
 no harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised the firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice i mean if somebody made a mistake harry went on and let something slip i know they didnt mean to do it its not their fault he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken weve got to trust each other i trust all of you i dont think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort 
 
 more silence followed his words they were all looking at him harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do as he drank he thought of had always been scathing about dumbledores willingness to trust people 
 
 well said harry said fred unexpectedly 
 
 year ear ear said george with half a glance at fred the corner of whose mouth twitched 
 
 lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at harry it was close to pitying 
 
 you think im a fool demanded harry 
 
 no i think youre like james said lupin who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends 
 
 harry knew what lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend peter pettigrew he felt irrationally angry he wanted to argue but lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed bill theres work to do i can ask kingsley whether c 
 
 no said bill at once ill do it ill come 
 
 where are you going said tonks and fleur together 
 
 body said lupin we need to recover it 
 
 cant it c began mrs weasley with an appealing look at bill 
 
 wait said bill not unless youd rather the death eaters took it 
 
 nobody spoke lupin and bill said good bye and left 
 
 the rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for harry who remained standing the suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence 
 
 ive got to go too said harry 
 
 ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him 
 
 dont be silly harry said mrs weasley what are you talking about 
 
 i cant stay here 
 
 he rubbed his forehead it was prickling again he had not hurt like this for more than a year 
 
 youre all in danger while im here i dont want c 
 
 but dont be so silly said mrs weasley the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked and fleurs agreed to get married here rather than in france weve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you c 
 
 she did not understand she was making him feel worse not better 
 
 if voldemort finds out im here c 
 
 but why should he asked mrs weasley 
 
 there are a dozen places you might be now harry said mr weasley hes got no way of knowing which safe house youre in 
 
 its not me im worried for said harry 
 
 we know that said mr weasley quietly but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left 
 
 yer not goin anywhere growled hagrid blimey harry after all we wen through ter get you here 
 
 yeah what about my bleeding ear said george hoisting himself up on his cushions 
 
 i know that c 
 
 wouldnt want c 
 
 i know harry bellowed 
 
 he felt beleaguered and blackmailed did they think he did not know what they had done for him didnt they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf there was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by mrs weasley 
 
 wheres hedwig harry she said coaxingly we can put her up with pidwidgeon and give her something to eat 
 
 his insides clenched like a fist he could not tell her the truth he drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering 
 
 wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry said hagrid escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh 
 
 it wasnt me said harry flatly it was my wand my wand acted of its own accord 
 
 after a few moments hermione said gently but thats impossible harry you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively 
 
 no said harry the bike was falling i couldnt have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasnt even a spell i recognized ive never made gold flames appear before 
 
 often said mr weasley when youre in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of small children often find before theyre trained c 
 
 it wasnt like that said harry through gritted teeth his scar was burning he felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match voldemorts 
 
 no one said anything he knew that they did not believe him now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before 
 
 his scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room 
 
 as he crossed the yard the great skeletal thestral looked up c rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore would have believed him he knew it dumbledore would have known how and why harrys wand had acted independently because dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and voldemorts but dumbledore like like sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where harry could never talk to them again he felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky 
 
 and then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked as he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head 
 
 you told me the problem would be solved by using anothers wand 
 
 and into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible scream a scream of unendurable agony 
 
 no no i beg you i beg you 
 
 you lied to lord voldemort ollivander 
 
 i did not i swear i did not 
 
 you sought to help potter to help him escape me 
 
 i swear i did not i believed a different wand would work 
 
 explain then what happened luciuss wand is destroyed 
 
 i cannot understand the connection exists only between your two wands 
 
 lies 
 
 please i beg you 
 
 and harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt voldemorts surge of vicious anger saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was over as quickly as it had come harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling it was several moments before he realized that ron and hermione were at his side 
 
 harry come back in the house hermione whispered you arent still thinking of leaving 
 
 yeah youve got to stay mate said ron thumping harry on the back 
 
 are you all right hermione asked close enough now to look into harrys face you look awful 
 
 well said harry shakily i probably look better than ollivander 
 
 when he had finished telling them what he had seen ron looked appalled but hermione downright terrified 
 
 but it was supposed to have stopped your scar c it wasnt supposed to do this anymore you mustnt let that connection open up again c dumbledore wanted you to close your mind 
 
 when he did not reply she gripped his arm 
 
 harry hes taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world dont let him inside your head too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter five fallen warriorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 hagrid 
 
 harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand he could not understand where voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead he crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was hagrid 
 
 hagrid hagrid talk to me c 
 
 but the dark mass did not stir 
 
 whos there is it potter are you harry potter 
 
 harry did not recognize the mans voice then a woman shouted theyve crashed ted crashed in the garden 
 
 harrys head was swimming 
 
 hagrid he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled 
 
 the next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm his missing tooth had been regrown the scar on his forehead was still throbbing 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room his rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy a man was watching harry anxiously 
 
 hagrids fine son said the man the wifes seeing to him now how are you feeling anything else broken ive fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm im ted by the way ted tonks c doras father 
 
 harry sat up too quickly lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy 
 
 voldemort c 
 
 easy now said ted tonks placing a hand on harrys shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions that was a nasty crash you just had what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions 
 
 no said harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound death eaters loads of them c we were chased c 
 
 death eaters said ted sharply what dyou mean death eaters i thought they didnt know you were being moved tonight i thought c 
 
 they knew said harry 
 
 ted tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above 
 
 well we know our protective charms hold then dont we they shouldnt be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction 
 
 now harry understood why voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the orders charms he only hoped they would continue to work he imagined voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what harry visualized as a great transparent bubble 
 
 he swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive he had barely stood up however when a door opened and hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive 
 
 harry 
 
 knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs blimey harry how did yeh get out o that i thought we were both goners 
 
 yeah me too i cant believe c 
 
 harry broke off he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind hagrid 
 
 you he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty 
 
 your wands here son said ted tapping it on harrys arm it fell right beside you i picked it upand thats my wife youre shouting at 
 
 oh im c im sorry 
 
 as she moved forward into the room mrs tonkss resemblance to her sister bellatrix became much less pronounced her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder nevertheless she looked a little haughty after harrys exclamation 
 
 what happened to our daughter she asked hagrid said you were ambushed where is nymphadora 
 
 i dont know said harry we dont know what happened to anyone else 
 
 she and ted exchanged looks a mixture of fear and guilt gripped harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault he had consented to the plan given them his hair 
 
 the portkey he said remembering all of a sudden weve got to get back to the burrow and find out c then well be able to send you word or c or tonks will once shes c 
 
 dorall be ok dromeda said ted she knows her stuff shes been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors the portkeys through here he added to harry its supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it 
 
 yeah we do said harry he seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders i c 
 
 he looked at mrs tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and insincere 
 
 ill tell tonks c dora c to send word when she thanks for patching us up thanks for everything i c 
 
 he was glad to leave the room and follow ted tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel 
 
 there you go son thats the portkey 
 
 mr tonks was pointing to a small hairbrush lying on the dressing table 
 
 thanks said harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave 
 
 wait a moment said hagrid looking around harry wheres hedwig 
 
 she she got hit said harry 
 
 the realization crashed over him he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes the owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the dursleys 
 
 hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder 
 
 never mind he said gruffly never mind she had a great old life c 
 
 hagrid said ted tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time 
 
 with a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the portkey as he and hagrid hurtled away from mr tonks second later harrys feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the burrow he heard screams throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush harry stood up swaying slightly and saw mrs weasley and ginny running down the steps by the back door as hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet 
 
 harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others cried mrs weasley 
 
 what dyou mean isnt anyone else back harry panted 
 
 the answer was clearly etched in mrs weasleys pale face 
 
 the death eaters were waiting for us harry told her we were surrounded the moment we took off c they knew it was tonight c i dont know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then voldemort caught up with us c 
 
 he could hear the note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but c 
 
 thank goodness youre all right she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved 
 
 havent go any brandy have yeh molly asked hagrid a little shakily fer medicinal purposes 
 
 she could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house harry knew that she wanted to hide her face he turned to ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once 
 
 ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby and that one she pointed at an ancient sneaker should have been dad and freds they were supposed to be second you and hagrid were third and she checked her watch if they made it george and lupin aught to be back in about a minute 
 
 mrs weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to hagrid he uncorked it and drank it straight down in one 
 
 mum shouted ginny pointing to a spot several feet away 
 
 a blue light had appeared in the darkness it grew larger and brighter and lupin and george appeared spinning and then falling harry knew immediately that there was something wrong lupin was supporting george who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood 
 
 harry ran forward and seized georges legs together he and lupin carried george into the house and through the kitchen to the living room where they laid him on the sofa as the lamplight fell across georges head ginny gasped and harrys stomach lurched one of georges ears was missing the side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood 
 
 no sooner had mrs weasley bent over her son that lupin grabbed harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door 
 
 oi said hagrid indignantly le go of him le go of harry 
 
 lupin ignored him 
 
 what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts he said giving harry a small shake answer me 
 
 a c a grindylow in a tank wasnt it 
 
 lupin released harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard 
 
 wha was tha about roared hagrid 
 
 im sorry harry but i had to check said lupin tersely weve been betrayed voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan you might have been an impostor 
 
 so why aren you checkin me panted hagrid still struggling with the door 
 
 youre said lupin looking up at hagrid the polyjuice potion is designed for human use only 
 
 none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight said harry the idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didnt know which one i was in the beginning if hed been in on the plan hed have known from the start i was the one with hagrid 
 
 voldemort caught up with you said lupin sharply what happened how did you escape 
 
 harry explained how the death eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned voldemort who had appeared just before he and hagrid had reached the sanctuary of tonkss parents 
 
 they recognized you but how what had you done 
 
 i harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion i saw stan shunpike you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of c well he doesnt know what hes doing does he he must be imperiused 
 
 lupin looked aghast 
 
 harry the time for disarming is past these people are trying to capture and kill you at least stun if you arent prepared to kill 
 
 we were hundreds of feet up stans not himself and if i stunned him and hed fallen hed have died the same as if id used avada kedavra expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago harry added defiantly lupin was reminding him of the sneering hufflepuff zacharias smith who had jeered at harry for wanting to teach dumbledores army how to disarm 
 
 yes harry said lupin with painful restraint and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under the imminent threat of death repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal 
 
 so you think i should have killed stan shunpike said harry angrily 
 
 of course not said lupin but the death eaters c frankly most people c would have expected you to attack back expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so 
 
 lupin was making harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him 
 
 i wont blast people out of my way just because theyre there said harry thats voldemorts job 
 
 lupins retort was lost finally succeeding in squeezing through the door hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies harry addressed lupin again 
 
 will george be okay 
 
 all lupins frustration with harry seemed to drain away at the question 
 
 i think so although theres no chance of replacing his ear not when its been cursed off c 
 
 there was a scuffling from outside lupin dived for the back door harry leapt over hagrids legs and sprinted into the yard 
 
 two figures had appeared in the yard and as harry ran toward them he realized they were hermione now returning to her normal appearance and kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger hermione flung herself into harrys arms but kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them over hermiones shoulder harry saw him raise his wand and point it at lupins chest 
 
 the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us 
 
 harry is the best hope we have trust him said lupin calmly 
 
 kingsley turned his wand on harry but lupin said its him ive checked 
 
 all right all right said kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak but somebody betrayed us they knew they knew it was tonight 
 
 so it seems replied lupin but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys 
 
 small comfort snarled kingsley who else is back 
 
 only harry hagrid george and me 
 
 hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand 
 
 what happened to you lupin asked kingsley 
 
 followed by five injured two mightve killed one kingsley reeled off and we saw as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly remus he can c 
 
 fly supplied harry i saw him too he came after hagrid and me 
 
 so thats why he left to follow you said kingsley i couldnt understand why hed vanished but what made him change targets 
 
 harry behaved a little too kindly to stan shunpike said lupin 
 
 stan repeated hermione but i thought he was in azkaban 
 
 kingsley let out a mirthless laugh 
 
 hermione theres obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up traverss hood fell off when i cursed him hes supposed to be inside too but what happened to you remus wheres george 
 
 he lost an ear said lupin 
 
 lost an c repeated hermione in a high voice 
 
 snapes work said lupin 
 
 snape shouted harry you didnt say c 
 
 he lost his hood during the chase sectumsempra was always a specialty of snapes i wish i could say id paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood 
 
 silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky there was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends where was ron where were fred and mr weasley where were bill fleur tonks and mundungus 
 
 harry give us a hand called hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again glad of something to do harry pulled him free the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where mrs weasley and ginny were still tending to george mrs weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight harry saw a clean gaping hole where georges ear had been 
 
 how is he 
 
 mrs weasley looked around and said i cant make it grow back not when its been removed by dark magic but it couldve been so much worse hes alive 
 
 yeah said harry thank god 
 
 did i hear someone else in the yard ginny asked 
 
 hermione and kingsley said harry 
 
 thank goodness ginny whispered they looked at each other harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that mrs weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen 
 
 ill prove who i am kingsley after ive seen my son now back off if you know whats good for you 
 
 harry had never heard mr weasley shout like that before he burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew fred right behind him both pale but uninjured 
 
 arthur sobbed mrs weasley oh thank goodness 
 
 how is he 
 
 mr weasley dropped to his knees beside george for the first time since harry had known him fred seemed to be lost for words he gaped over the back of the sofa at his twins wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing 
 
 perhaps roused by the sound of fred and their fathers arrival george stirred 
 
 how do you feel georgie whispered mrs weasley 
 
 georges fingers groped for the side of his head 
 
 saintlike he murmured 
 
 whats wrong with him croaked fred looking terrified is his mind affected 
 
 saintlike repeated george opening his eyes and looking up at his brother you see im holy holey fred geddit 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever color flooded freds pale face 
 
 pathetic he told george pathetic with the whole wide world of humor before you you go for holey 
 
 ah well said george grinning at his mother youll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum 
 
 he looked around 
 
 hi harry c you are harry right 
 
 yeah i am said harry moving closer to the sofa 
 
 well at least we got you back okay said george why arent ron and bill huddled round my sickbed 
 
 theyre not back yet george said mrs weasley georges grin faded harry glanced at ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside as they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice 
 
 ron and tonks should be back by now they didnt have a long journey auntie muriels not that far from here 
 
 harry said nothing he had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat as they walked down the back steps into the dark yard ginny took his hand 
 
 kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned harry was reminded of uncle vernon pacing the living room a million years ago hagrid hermione and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence none of them looked around when harry and ginny joined their silent vigil 
 
 the minutes stretched into what might as well have been years the slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing order members might leap unscathed from its leaves c 
 
 and then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground c 
 
 its them screamed hermione 
 
 tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere 
 
 remus tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into lupins arms his face was set and white he seemed unable to speak ron tripped dazedly toward harry and hermione 
 
 youre okay he mumbled before hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly 
 
 i thought c i thought c 
 
 m all right said ron patting her on the back m fine 
 
 ron was great said tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on lupin wonderful stunned one of the death eaters straight to the head and when youre aiming at a moving target from a flying broom c 
 
 you did said hermione gazing up at ron with her arms still around his neck 
 
 always the tone of surprise he said a little grumpily breaking free are we the last back 
 
 no said ginny were still waiting for bill and fleur and and mundungus im going to tell mum and dad youre okay ron c 
 
 she ran back inside 
 
 so what kept you what happened lupin sounded almost angry at tonks 
 
 bellatrix said tonks she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me i just wish id got her i owe bellatrix but we definitely injured rodolphus then we got to rons auntie muriels and we missed our portkey and she was fussing over us c 
 
 a muscle was jumping in lupins jaw he nodded but seemed unable to say anything else 
 
 so what happened to you lot tonks asked turning to harry hermione and kingsley 
 
 they recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of bill fleur and mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore 
 
 im going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago said kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky let me know when theyre back 
 
 lupin nodded with a wave to the others kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate harry thought he heard the faintest pop as kingsley disapparated just beyond the burrows boundaries 
 
 mr and mrs weasley came racing down the back steps ginny behind them both parents hugged ron before turning to lupin and tonks 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley for our sons 
 
 dont be silly molly said tonks at once 
 
 hows george asked lupin 
 
 whats wrong with him piped up ron 
 
 hes lost c 
 
 but the end of mrs weasleys sentence was drowned in a general outcry a thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them bill and fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt 
 
 bill thank god thank god c 
 
 mrs weasley ran forward but the hug bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory looking directly at his father he said dead 
 
 nobody spoke nobody moved harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever 
 
 we saw it said bill fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window it happened just after we broke out of the circle and dung were close by us they were heading north too voldemort c he can fly c went straight for them dung panicked i heard him cry out tried to stop him but he disapparated voldemorts curse hit full in the face he fell backward off his broom and c there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail c 
 
 bills voice broke 
 
 of course you couldnt have done anything said lupin 
 
 they all stood looking at each other harry could not quite comprehend it dead it could not be so tough so brave the consummate survivor 
 
 at last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point of waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed mr and mrs weasley back into the burrow and into the living room where fred and george were laughing together 
 
 whats wrong said fred scanning their faces as they entered whats happened whos c 
 
 said mr weasley dead 
 
 the twins grins turned to grimaces of shock nobody seemed to know what to do tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief she had been close to harry knew his favorite and his protge at the ministry of magic hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his handkerchief 
 
 bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of and some glasses 
 
 here he said and with a wave of his wand eh sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft 
 
 they all said and drank 
 
 echoed hagrid a little late with a hiccup the firewhisky seared harrys throat it seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage 
 
 so mundungus disappeared said lupin who had drained his own glass in one 
 
 the atmosphere changed at once everybody looked tense watching lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear 
 
 i know what youre thinking said bill and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didnt they but mundungus cant have betrayed us they didnt know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case youve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery why wouldnt he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked its as simple as that he didnt want to come in the first place but made him and went straight for them it was enough to make anyone panic 
 
 acted exactly as expected him to sniffed tonks said hed expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors he chased first and when mundungus gave them away he switched to kingsley 
 
 yes and zat eez all very good snapped fleur but still eet does not explain ow zey know we were moving arry tonight does eet somebody must ave been careless somebody let slip ze date to an outsider it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan 
 
 she glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her nobody did the only sound to break the silence was that of hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief harry glanced at hagrid who had just risked his own life to save harrys c hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragons egg 
 
 no harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised the firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice i mean if somebody made a mistake harry went on and let something slip i know they didnt mean to do it its not their fault he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken weve got to trust each other i trust all of you i dont think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort 
 
 more silence followed his words they were all looking at him harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do as he drank he thought of had always been scathing about dumbledores willingness to trust people 
 
 well said harry said fred unexpectedly 
 
 year ear ear said george with half a glance at fred the corner of whose mouth twitched 
 
 lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at harry it was close to pitying 
 
 you think im a fool demanded harry 
 
 no i think youre like james said lupin who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends 
 
 harry knew what lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend peter pettigrew he felt irrationally angry he wanted to argue but lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed bill theres work to do i can ask kingsley whether c 
 
 no said bill at once ill do it ill come 
 
 where are you going said tonks and fleur together 
 
 body said lupin we need to recover it 
 
 cant it c began mrs weasley with an appealing look at bill 
 
 wait said bill not unless youd rather the death eaters took it 
 
 nobody spoke lupin and bill said good bye and left 
 
 the rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for harry who remained standing the suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence 
 
 ive got to go too said harry 
 
 ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him 
 
 dont be silly harry said mrs weasley what are you talking about 
 
 i cant stay here 
 
 he rubbed his forehead it was prickling again he had not hurt like this for more than a year 
 
 youre all in danger while im here i dont want c 
 
 but dont be so silly said mrs weasley the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked and fleurs agreed to get married here rather than in france weve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you c 
 
 she did not understand she was making him feel worse not better 
 
 if voldemort finds out im here c 
 
 but why should he asked mrs weasley 
 
 there are a dozen places you might be now harry said mr weasley hes got no way of knowing which safe house youre in 
 
 its not me im worried for said harry 
 
 we know that said mr weasley quietly but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left 
 
 yer not goin anywhere growled hagrid blimey harry after all we wen through ter get you here 
 
 yeah what about my bleeding ear said george hoisting himself up on his cushions 
 
 i know that c 
 
 wouldnt want c 
 
 i know harry bellowed 
 
 he felt beleaguered and blackmailed did they think he did not know what they had done for him didnt they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf there was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by mrs weasley 
 
 wheres hedwig harry she said coaxingly we can put her up with pidwidgeon and give her something to eat 
 
 his insides clenched like a fist he could not tell her the truth he drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering 
 
 wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry said hagrid escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh 
 
 it wasnt me said harry flatly it was my wand my wand acted of its own accord 
 
 after a few moments hermione said gently but thats impossible harry you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively 
 
 no said harry the bike was falling i couldnt have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasnt even a spell i recognized ive never made gold flames appear before 
 
 often said mr weasley when youre in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of small children often find before theyre trained c 
 
 it wasnt like that said harry through gritted teeth his scar was burning he felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match voldemorts 
 
 no one said anything he knew that they did not believe him now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before 
 
 his scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room 
 
 as he crossed the yard the great skeletal thestral looked up c rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore would have believed him he knew it dumbledore would have known how and why harrys wand had acted independently because dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and voldemorts but dumbledore like like sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where harry could never talk to them again he felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky 
 
 and then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked as he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head 
 
 you told me the problem would be solved by using anothers wand 
 
 and into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible scream a scream of unendurable agony 
 
 no no i beg you i beg you 
 
 you lied to lord voldemort ollivander 
 
 i did not i swear i did not 
 
 you sought to help potter to help him escape me 
 
 i swear i did not i believed a different wand would work 
 
 explain then what happened luciuss wand is destroyed 
 
 i cannot understand the connection exists only between your two wands 
 
 lies 
 
 please i beg you 
 
 and harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt voldemorts surge of vicious anger saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was over as quickly as it had come harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling it was several moments before he realized that ron and hermione were at his side 
 
 harry come back in the house hermione whispered you arent still thinking of leaving 
 
 yeah youve got to stay mate said ron thumping harry on the back 
 
 are you all right hermione asked close enough now to look into harrys face you look awful 
 
 well said harry shakily i probably look better than ollivander 
 
 when he had finished telling them what he had seen ron looked appalled but hermione downright terrified 
 
 but it was supposed to have stopped your scar c it wasnt supposed to do this anymore you mustnt let that connection open up again c dumbledore wanted you to close your mind 
 
 when he did not reply she gripped his arm 
 
 harry hes taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world dont let him inside your head too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
