 int room 
 across the room a dark figure stares out the tall 
 windows veiled with decaying lace he turns and his 
 smile lights up the room 
 morpheus 
 at last 
 he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible 
 behind circular mirrored glasses 
 he strides to neo and they shake hands 
 morpheus 
 welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus 
 neo 
 an honor 
 morpheus 
 please come sit 
 he nods to trinity 
 morpheus 
 thank you trinity 
 she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an 
 adjacent room 
 they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy 
 leather chairs 
 morpheus 
 i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling 
 down the rabbit hole 
 neo 
 you could say that 
 morpheus 
 i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts 
 what he sees because he is expecting to wake up 
 a smile curls the corner of his lips 
 morpheus 
 ironically this is not far from the truth but getting ahead 
 of myself can you tell me neo why are you here 
 neo 
 morpheus a legend most hackers would die to meet 
 you 
 morpheus 
 yes thank you but i think we both know more to it than 
 that do you believe in fate neo 
 neo 
 no 
 morpheus 
 why not 
 neo 
 because i like the idea that not in control of my life 
 morpheus 
 i know exactly what you mean 
 again that smile that could cut glass 
 morpheus 
 let me tell you why you are here you are here because you have the gift 
 neo 
 what gift 
 morpheus 
 watched you neo you do not use a computer like a tool you 
 use it like it was part of yourself what you can do inside 
 a computer is not normal i know seen it what you do is 
 magic 
 neo shrugs 
 neo 
 not magic 
 morpheus 
 but it is neo it is how else would you describe what has been 
 happening to you 
 he leans forward 
 morpheus 
 we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and 
 logical have you ever wondered why 
 neo shakes his head 
 morpheus 
 as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible 
 which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a 
 mind like yours can be very difficult 
 neo 
 free from what 
 morpheus 
 from the matrix 
 neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself 
 morpheus 
 do you want to know what it is neo 
 neo swallows and nods his head 
 morpheus 
 that feeling you have had all your life that feeling that 
 something was wrong with the world you know what it is 
 but there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad 
 driving you to me but what is it 
 the leather creaks as he leans back 
 morpheus 
 the matrix is everywhere all around us here even in this room 
 you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it 
 when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is 
 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from 
 the truth 
 neo 
 what truth 
 morpheus 
 that you are a slave neo that you like everyone else was born 
 into bondage 
 kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch a 
 prison for your mind 
 outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass 
 morpheus 
 unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to 
 see it for yourself 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 hold out your hands 
 in right hand morpheus drops a red pill 
 morpheus 
 this is your last chance after this there is no going back 
 in his left a blue pill 
 morpheus 
 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed 
 and you believe whatever you want to believe 
 the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses 
 morpheus 
 you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the goes 
 neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the 
 moisture growing in his palms 
 morpheus 
 remember that all i am offering is the truth nothing more 
 neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill the 
 cheshire smile returns 
 morpheus 
 follow me 
 he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with 
 equipment glowing and electric green 
 from the racks of monitors 
 trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter 
 cypher 
 shit 
 trinity 
 i knew he would 
 cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone 
 away from neo 
 cypher 
 morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake 
 rushing him old afraid he might pop 
 morpheus 
 i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life 
 apoc are we 
 neo recognizes the large man from the el train 
 apoc 
 almost 
 he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex 
 system of monitors modules and drives 
 neo 
 apoc you wrote the four horsemen virus 
 apoc 
 right 
 morpheus 
 neo time is always against us will you take a seat there 
 in the center of the room sits a chair near the chair 
 is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked 
 morpheus 
 i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality 
 neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode 
 disks to his head arns and the back of his neck 
 neo 
 a little 
 morpheus 
 tell me about it 
 neo 
 essentially a hardware system that uses an apparatus 
 headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a 
 computer program 
 morpheus 
 if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all 
 of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world 
 neo 
 you might not no 
 morpheus 
 no you 
 neo whispers to trinity 
 neo 
 you did all this 
 she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears 
 they are wired to an old hotel phone 
 morpheus 
 the pill you took is part of a trace program going to make 
 things feel a bit strange 
 distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding 
 on a keyboard sweat beads his face his eyes blink and 
 twitch when he notices the mirror 
 he stares as it begins to heal itself a 
 webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the 
 mirror were becoming liquid 
 neo 
 shit 
 cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent 
 data trinity monitors electric vital signs 
 neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers 
 disappear beneath the rippling surface 
 quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror 
 stretches in long rubbery strands like 
 stuck to his fingertips 
 neo 
 what is this mescaline 
 morpheus 
 just relax neo 
 the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away 
 until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break 
 with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes 
 of mercury fall hit the ground and 
 fade 
 he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored 
 icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running 
 like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms 
 where he sees his face reflected 
 neo 
 
 trinity 
 going into replication 
 morpheus 
 apoc 
 apoc 
 still nothing 
 morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number 
 morpheus 
 tank going to need the signal soon stay calm neo 
 the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up 
 his arns like hundreds of insects 
 neo 
 cold 
 the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic 
 tipping his head as though he were sinking into the 
 mirror trying to keep his mouth up 
 neo 
 all over me 
 morpheus is right next to him with the phone 
 trinity 
 i got a fibrillation 
 cypher 
 i knew it i knew it 
 morpheus 
 shit apoc 
 streams of mercury run from nose 
 apoc 
 targeting almost there 
 an alarm on monitor erupts 
 trinity 
 going into arrest 
 cypher 
 gonna pop 
 apoc 
 lock i got him 
 morpheus 
 now tank now 
 his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a 
 electric scream erupts in the headphones 
 it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to 
 another computer 
 body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were 
 pulled into the holes of the phone 
 sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness

lionfish nov chapter eight the deathday partycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud 
 
 even aside from the rain and wind it been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath fulfill their requirements half an inch if that 
 
 hello nick said harry 
 
 hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside 
 
 you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet 
 
 so do you said harry 
 
 ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance not as though i really wanted to join thought apply but apparently i fulfill requirements 
 
 in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face 
 
 but you would think you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt 
 
 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree 
 
 i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously 
 
 we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick 
 
 fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away 
 
 half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think good and beheaded but oh no not enough for sir properly 
 
 nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so bothering you anything i can do 
 
 no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly 
 
 the rest of sentence was drowned out by a mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students 
 
 better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch in a good mood got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place 
 
 right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to right wheezing and looking wildly about for the there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple 
 
 filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere had enough of it i tell you follow me potter 
 
 so harry waved a gloomy to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling 
 
 filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment 
 
 dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines had enough of it make an example the form yes 
 
 he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot 
 
 name harry potter crime 
 
 it was only a bit of mud said harry 
 
 only a bit of mud to you boy but to me an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence 
 
 dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall 
 
 but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle 
 
 peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage have you this time have you 
 
 and without a backward glance at harry filch ran from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him 
 
 peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry much like peeves but help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry 
 
 thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read 
 
 kwikspell 
 
 a correspondence course in 
 
 intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said 
 
 
 feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork 
 
 there is an answer 
 
 kwikspell is an course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method 
 
 madam z nettles of topsham writes 
 
 i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution 
 
 warlock d j prod of didsbury says 
 
 my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell 
 
 fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened 
 
 filch was looking triumphant 
 
 that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris have peeves out this time my sweet 
 
 his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started 
 
 pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer 
 
 have you did you read he sputtered 
 
 no harry lied quickly 
 
 knobbly hands were twisting together 
 
 if i thought read my private not that mine for a friend be that as it may however 
 
 harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf help 
 
 very well go and breathe a word not that however if you read go now i have to write up go 
 
 amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from office without punishment was probably some kind of school record 
 
 harry harry did it work 
 
 nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height 
 
 i persuaded peeves to crash it right over office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him 
 
 was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i even get detention thanks nick 
 
 they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir rejection letter 
 
 i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he it was like stepping through an icy shower 
 
 but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you want 
 
 what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified 
 
 oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right 
 
 holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks 
 
 no said harry quickly come 
 
 my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me 
 
 of of course said harry 
 
 nearly headless nick beamed at him 
 
 a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there many living people who can say been to one of those be fascinating 
 
 why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me 
 
 rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people 
 
 harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from mind 
 
 by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment 
 
 a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said go to the deathday party 
 
 so at seven harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons 
 
 the passageway leading to nearly headless party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard 
 
 is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes 
 
 my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come 
 
 he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside 
 
 it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised platform a chandelier overhead blazed with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer 
 
 shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet 
 
 careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts 
 
 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i want to talk to moaning myrtle 
 
 who said harry as they backtracked quickly 
 
 she haunts one of the toilets in the on the first floor said hermione 
 
 she haunts a toilet 
 
 yes been all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you 
 
 look food said ron 
 
 on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with icing forming the words 
 
 sir nicholas de 
 
 died st october 
 
 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon 
 
 can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him 
 
 almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away 
 
 i expect let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis 
 
 can we move i feel sick said ron 
 
 they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them 
 
 hello peeves said harry cautiously 
 
 unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face 
 
 nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus 
 
 no thanks said hermione 
 
 heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle 
 
 oh no peeves tell her what i said be really upset hermione whispered frantically i mean it i mind her er hello myrtle 
 
 the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles 
 
 what she said sulkily 
 
 how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice nice to see you out of the toilet 
 
 myrtle sniffed 
 
 miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in ear just saying 
 
 just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves 
 
 myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously 
 
 making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small eyes 
 
 no honestly i just say how nice looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 she did 
 
 lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder think i know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle 
 
 forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear 
 
 moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply 
 
 oh dear said hermione sadly 
 
 nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd 
 
 enjoying yourselves 
 
 oh yes they lied 
 
 not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent nearly time for my speech better go and warn the orchestra 
 
 the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded 
 
 oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly 
 
 through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of face 
 
 the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck 
 
 nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there 
 
 he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder 
 
 welcome patrick said nick stiffly 
 
 live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter 
 
 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly 
 
 mind nick shouted sir head from the floor still upset we let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow 
 
 i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick very frightening and er 
 
 ha yelled sir head 
 
 bet he asked you to say that 
 
 if i could have attention time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight 
 
 my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow 
 
 but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir head went sailing past him to loud cheers 
 
 harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry 
 
 i stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor 
 
 go harry agreed 
 
 they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles 
 
 pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall 
 
 and then harry heard it 
 
 rip tear kill 
 
 it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in office 
 
 he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway 
 
 harry you 
 
 that voice again shut up a minute 
 
 soo hungry for so long 
 
 listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him 
 
 kill time to kill 
 
 the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings matter 
 
 this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him 
 
 harry we 
 
 shh 
 
 harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood 
 
 his stomach lurched 
 
 going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring and bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage 
 
 harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i hear anything 
 
 but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor 
 
 look 
 
 something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been 
 
 opened enemies of the heir beware 
 
 that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice 
 
 as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splash 
 
 mrs norris the cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring 
 
 for a few seconds they move then ron said get out of here 
 
 we try and help harry began awkwardly 
 
 trust me said ron we want to be found here 
 
 but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends 
 
 the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight 
 
 then someone shouted through the quiet 
 
 enemies of the heir beware be next mudbloods 
 
 it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets

 hello nick said harry 
 
 hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside 
 
 you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet 
 
 so do you said harry 
 
 ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance not as though i really wanted to join thought apply but apparently i fulfill requirements 
 
 in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face 
 
 but you would think you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt 
 
 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree 
 
 i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously 
 
 we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick 
 
 fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away 
 
 half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think good and beheaded but oh no not enough for sir properly 
 
 nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so bothering you anything i can do 
 
 no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly 
 
 the rest of sentence was drowned out by a mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students 
 
 better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch in a good mood got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place 
 
 right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to right wheezing and looking wildly about for the there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple 
 
 filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere had enough of it i tell you follow me potter 
 
 so harry waved a gloomy to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling 
 
 filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment 
 
 dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines had enough of it make an example the form yes 
 
 he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot 
 
 name harry potter crime 
 
 it was only a bit of mud said harry 
 
 only a bit of mud to you boy but to me an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence 
 
 dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall 
 
 but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle 
 
 peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage have you this time have you 
 
 and without a backward glance at harry filch ran from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him 
 
 peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry much like peeves but help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry 
 
 thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read 
 
 kwikspell 
 
 a correspondence course in 
 
 intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said 
 
 
 feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork 
 
 there is an answer 
 
 kwikspell is an course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method 
 
 madam z nettles of topsham writes 
 
 i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution 
 
 warlock d j prod of didsbury says 
 
 my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell 
 
 fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened 
 
 filch was looking triumphant 
 
 that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris have peeves out this time my sweet 
 
 his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started 
 
 pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer 
 
 have you did you read he sputtered 
 
 no harry lied quickly 
 
 knobbly hands were twisting together 
 
 if i thought read my private not that mine for a friend be that as it may however 
 
 harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf help 
 
 very well go and breathe a word not that however if you read go now i have to write up go 
 
 amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from office without punishment was probably some kind of school record 
 
 harry harry did it work 
 
 nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height 
 
 i persuaded peeves to crash it right over office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him 
 
 was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i even get detention thanks nick 
 
 they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir rejection letter 
 
 i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he it was like stepping through an icy shower 
 
 but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you want 
 
 what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified 
 
 oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right 
 
 holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks 
 
 no said harry quickly come 
 
 my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me 
 
 of of course said harry 
 
 nearly headless nick beamed at him 
 
 a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there many living people who can say been to one of those be fascinating 
 
 why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me 
 
 rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people 
 
 harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from mind 
 
 by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment 
 
 a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said go to the deathday party 
 
 so at seven harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons 
 
 the passageway leading to nearly headless party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard 
 
 is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes 
 
 my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come 
 
 he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside 
 
 it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised platform a chandelier overhead blazed with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer 
 
 shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet 
 
 careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts 
 
 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i want to talk to moaning myrtle 
 
 who said harry as they backtracked quickly 
 
 she haunts one of the toilets in the on the first floor said hermione 
 
 she haunts a toilet 
 
 yes been all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you 
 
 look food said ron 
 
 on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with icing forming the words 
 
 sir nicholas de 
 
 died st october 
 
 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon 
 
 can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him 
 
 almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away 
 
 i expect let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis 
 
 can we move i feel sick said ron 
 
 they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them 
 
 hello peeves said harry cautiously 
 
 unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face 
 
 nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus 
 
 no thanks said hermione 
 
 heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle 
 
 oh no peeves tell her what i said be really upset hermione whispered frantically i mean it i mind her er hello myrtle 
 
 the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles 
 
 what she said sulkily 
 
 how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice nice to see you out of the toilet 
 
 myrtle sniffed 
 
 miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in ear just saying 
 
 just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves 
 
 myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously 
 
 making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small eyes 
 
 no honestly i just say how nice looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 she did 
 
 lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder think i know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle 
 
 forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear 
 
 moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply 
 
 oh dear said hermione sadly 
 
 nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd 
 
 enjoying yourselves 
 
 oh yes they lied 
 
 not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent nearly time for my speech better go and warn the orchestra 
 
 the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded 
 
 oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly 
 
 through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of face 
 
 the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck 
 
 nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there 
 
 he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder 
 
 welcome patrick said nick stiffly 
 
 live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter 
 
 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly 
 
 mind nick shouted sir head from the floor still upset we let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow 
 
 i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick very frightening and er 
 
 ha yelled sir head 
 
 bet he asked you to say that 
 
 if i could have attention time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight 
 
 my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow 
 
 but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir head went sailing past him to loud cheers 
 
 harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry 
 
 i stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor 
 
 go harry agreed 
 
 they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles 
 
 pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall 
 
 and then harry heard it 
 
 rip tear kill 
 
 it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in office 
 
 he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway 
 
 harry you 
 
 that voice again shut up a minute 
 
 soo hungry for so long 
 
 listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him 
 
 kill time to kill 
 
 the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings matter 
 
 this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him 
 
 harry we 
 
 shh 
 
 harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood 
 
 his stomach lurched 
 
 going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring and bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage 
 
 harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i hear anything 
 
 but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor 
 
 look 
 
 something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been 
 
 opened enemies of the heir beware 
 
 that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice 
 
 as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splash 
 
 mrs norris the cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring 
 
 for a few seconds they move then ron said get out of here 
 
 we try and help harry began awkwardly 
 
 trust me said ron we want to be found here 
 
 but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends 
 
 the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight 
 
 then someone shouted through the quiet 
 
 enemies of the heir beware be next mudbloods 
 
 it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight flight of the fat ladycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin 
 
 look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf 
 
 but no one else cared that professor robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds 
 
 harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor name and he was bullying neville worse than ever 
 
 harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed 
 
 nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence 
 
 why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats 
 
 at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season 
 
 there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red ball through one of the hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged ball whose capture ended the game and earned the team an extra one hundred and fifty points 
 
 oliver wood was a burly now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field 
 
 this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them be leaving at the end of this year never get another shot at it 
 
 gryffindor won for seven years now okay so had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye got three superb chasers 
 
 wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell 
 
 got two unbeatable beaters 
 
 stop it oliver embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush 
 
 and got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought 
 
 we think very good too oliver said george 
 
 spanking good keeper said fred 
 
 the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team thought the thing was in the bag but we got it and this the last chance get to finally see our name on the thing 
 
 wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic 
 
 oliver this our year said fred 
 
 do it oliver said angelina 
 
 definitely said harry 
 
 full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
 
 harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly 
 
 happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy 
 
 first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween 
 
 excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit nearly out of stink pellets 
 
 harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind 
 
 harry sure be able to go next time she said bound to catch black soon been sighted once already 
 
 not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages 
 
 ron said hermione supposed to stay in school 
 
 he be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry 
 
 yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth 
 
 does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling 
 
 clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione 
 
 crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron 
 
 just keep him over there all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart got scabbers asleep in my bag 
 
 harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work 
 
 you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry 
 
 hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced 
 
 oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal 
 
 ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
 
 ron hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top 
 
 catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers 
 
 george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw 
 
 ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail 
 
 look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her skin and bone you keep that cat away from him 
 
 crookshanks understand wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron 
 
 something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag 
 
 oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else think 
 
 that got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and ill 
 
 ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories 
 
 
 
 ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod 
 
 scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail 
 
 hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor 
 
 careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes 
 
 they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line 
 
 lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious 
 
 the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
 
 she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered her rabbit binky been killed by a fox 
 
 oh said hermione sorry lavender 
 
 i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is 
 
 er 
 
 the sixteenth of october that thing dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right 
 
 the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox 
 
 well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying i 
 
 oh said hermione she paused again then 
 
 was binky an old rabbit 
 
 n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby 
 
 parvati tightened her arm around shoulders 
 
 but then why would you dread him dying said hermione 
 
 parvati glared at her 
 
 well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly c and she have been dreading it because come as a real shock 
 
 mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she think other pets matter very much 
 
 professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and talk to each other for the whole class 
 
 harry still decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first 
 
 one moment please she called as the class made to leave as all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so forget 
 
 neville put up his hand 
 
 please professor i i think lost 
 
 your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well all you may leave 
 
 ask her now ron hissed at harry 
 
 oh but hermione began 
 
 go for it harry said ron stubbornly 
 
 harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor desk 
 
 yes potter harry took a deep breath 
 
 professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but say anything 
 
 so er think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk 
 
 afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village the rule 
 
 but professor my aunt and uncle you know muggles they really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go 
 
 but i say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity sorry potter but my final word you had better hurry or be late for your next lesson 
 
 
 
 there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade 
 
 always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening 
 
 yeah said harry gloomily great 
 
 the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort 
 
 they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry not all cracked up to be he said seriously all right the rather good and joke frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking always worth a visit but really harry apart from that not missing anything 
 
 
 
 on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
 
 bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him 
 
 yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of difficulties 
 
 worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice see you at the feast have a good time 
 
 he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who be going 
 
 staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors 
 
 harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower 
 
 password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze 
 
 fortuna major said harry listlessly 
 
 the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off 
 
 harry harry hi harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him 
 
 you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry 
 
 er no thanks colin said harry who in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i got to go to the library got to get some work done 
 
 after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again 
 
 what was the point of waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away 
 
 harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he feel like working he turned around and came with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors 
 
 what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight 
 
 but harry go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry 
 
 harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door 
 
 what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione 
 
 hogsmeade said harry in a casual voice 
 
 ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why you come in just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers 
 
 water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle 
 
 the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
 
 cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one 
 
 all right said harry awkwardly 
 
 lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout 
 
 sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin only got teabags afraid but i daresay had enough of tea leaves 
 
 harry looked at him eyes were twinkling 
 
 how did you know about that harry asked 
 
 professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea not worried are you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he cope with a boggart 
 
 something of thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry 
 
 no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on desk you know that day we fought the boggart 
 
 yes said lupin slowly 
 
 why you let me fight it said harry abruptly 
 
 lupin raised his eyebrows 
 
 i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised 
 
 harry who had expected lupin to deny that done any such thing was taken aback 
 
 why he said again 
 
 well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort 
 
 harry stared not only was this the last answer expected but lupin had said name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore 
 
 clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic 
 
 i think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors 
 
 i see said lupin thoughtfully well impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry 
 
 harry know what to say to that so he drank some more tea 
 
 so been thinking that i believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly 
 
 wellyeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors 
 
 he was interrupted by a knock on the door 
 
 come in called lupin 
 
 the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing 
 
 ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me 
 
 snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin 
 
 i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank 
 
 fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin 
 
 yes yes i will said lupin 
 
 i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more 
 
 i should probably have some again tomorrow thanks very much severus 
 
 not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful 
 
 harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
 
 professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering 
 
 why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question 
 
 been feeling a bit he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there many wizards who are up to making it 
 
 professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands 
 
 professor very interested in the dark arts he blurted out 
 
 really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion 
 
 some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job 
 
 lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face 
 
 disgusting he said well harry better get back to work see you at the feast later 
 
 right said harry putting down his empty teacup 
 
 the empty goblet was still smoking 
 
 
 
 there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
 
 a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room from the cold wind and looking as though had the time of their lives 
 
 thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps hogsmeade like where did you go 
 
 by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides 
 
 the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all depending on how fast you want your letter to get there 
 
 honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples a bit look 
 
 we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks 
 
 wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up 
 
 what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done 
 
 no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in 
 
 he told them all about the goblet mouth fell open 
 
 lupin drank it he gasped is he mad 
 
 hermione checked her watch 
 
 better go down you know the be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape 
 
 but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he have done it in front of harry 
 
 yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes 
 
 the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural 
 
 the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
 
 it had been such a pleasant evening that good mood even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students 
 
 why anyone going in said ron curiously 
 
 harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed 
 
 let me through please came voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd the holdup here you all have forgotten the password excuse me head boy 
 
 and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick 
 
 heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe 
 
 going on said ginny who had just arrived 
 
 a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was 
 
 oh my hermione grabbed arm 
 
 the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him 
 
 we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady 
 
 be lucky said a cackling voice 
 
 it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry 
 
 what do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and grin faded a little he dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir want to be seen a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly 
 
 did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly 
 
 oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper got that sirius black 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight flight of the fat ladycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin 
 
 look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf 
 
 but no one else cared that professor robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds 
 
 harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor name and he was bullying neville worse than ever 
 
 harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed 
 
 nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence 
 
 why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats 
 
 at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season 
 
 there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red ball through one of the hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged ball whose capture ended the game and earned the team an extra one hundred and fifty points 
 
 oliver wood was a burly now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field 
 
 this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them be leaving at the end of this year never get another shot at it 
 
 gryffindor won for seven years now okay so had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye got three superb chasers 
 
 wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell 
 
 got two unbeatable beaters 
 
 stop it oliver embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush 
 
 and got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought 
 
 we think very good too oliver said george 
 
 spanking good keeper said fred 
 
 the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team thought the thing was in the bag but we got it and this the last chance get to finally see our name on the thing 
 
 wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic 
 
 oliver this our year said fred 
 
 do it oliver said angelina 
 
 definitely said harry 
 
 full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
 
 harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly 
 
 happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy 
 
 first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween 
 
 excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit nearly out of stink pellets 
 
 harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind 
 
 harry sure be able to go next time she said bound to catch black soon been sighted once already 
 
 not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages 
 
 ron said hermione supposed to stay in school 
 
 he be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry 
 
 yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth 
 
 does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling 
 
 clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione 
 
 crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron 
 
 just keep him over there all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart got scabbers asleep in my bag 
 
 harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work 
 
 you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry 
 
 hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced 
 
 oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal 
 
 ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
 
 ron hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top 
 
 catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers 
 
 george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw 
 
 ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail 
 
 look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her skin and bone you keep that cat away from him 
 
 crookshanks understand wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron 
 
 something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag 
 
 oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else think 
 
 that got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and ill 
 
 ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories 
 
 
 
 ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod 
 
 scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail 
 
 hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor 
 
 careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes 
 
 they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line 
 
 lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious 
 
 the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
 
 she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered her rabbit binky been killed by a fox 
 
 oh said hermione sorry lavender 
 
 i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is 
 
 er 
 
 the sixteenth of october that thing dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right 
 
 the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox 
 
 well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying i 
 
 oh said hermione she paused again then 
 
 was binky an old rabbit 
 
 n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby 
 
 parvati tightened her arm around shoulders 
 
 but then why would you dread him dying said hermione 
 
 parvati glared at her 
 
 well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly c and she have been dreading it because come as a real shock 
 
 mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she think other pets matter very much 
 
 professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and talk to each other for the whole class 
 
 harry still decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first 
 
 one moment please she called as the class made to leave as all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so forget 
 
 neville put up his hand 
 
 please professor i i think lost 
 
 your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well all you may leave 
 
 ask her now ron hissed at harry 
 
 oh but hermione began 
 
 go for it harry said ron stubbornly 
 
 harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor desk 
 
 yes potter harry took a deep breath 
 
 professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but say anything 
 
 so er think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk 
 
 afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village the rule 
 
 but professor my aunt and uncle you know muggles they really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go 
 
 but i say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity sorry potter but my final word you had better hurry or be late for your next lesson 
 
 
 
 there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade 
 
 always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening 
 
 yeah said harry gloomily great 
 
 the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort 
 
 they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry not all cracked up to be he said seriously all right the rather good and joke frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking always worth a visit but really harry apart from that not missing anything 
 
 
 
 on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
 
 bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him 
 
 yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of difficulties 
 
 worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice see you at the feast have a good time 
 
 he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who be going 
 
 staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors 
 
 harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower 
 
 password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze 
 
 fortuna major said harry listlessly 
 
 the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off 
 
 harry harry hi harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him 
 
 you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry 
 
 er no thanks colin said harry who in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i got to go to the library got to get some work done 
 
 after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again 
 
 what was the point of waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away 
 
 harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he feel like working he turned around and came with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors 
 
 what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight 
 
 but harry go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry 
 
 harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door 
 
 what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione 
 
 hogsmeade said harry in a casual voice 
 
 ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why you come in just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers 
 
 water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle 
 
 the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
 
 cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one 
 
 all right said harry awkwardly 
 
 lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout 
 
 sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin only got teabags afraid but i daresay had enough of tea leaves 
 
 harry looked at him eyes were twinkling 
 
 how did you know about that harry asked 
 
 professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea not worried are you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he cope with a boggart 
 
 something of thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry 
 
 no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on desk you know that day we fought the boggart 
 
 yes said lupin slowly 
 
 why you let me fight it said harry abruptly 
 
 lupin raised his eyebrows 
 
 i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised 
 
 harry who had expected lupin to deny that done any such thing was taken aback 
 
 why he said again 
 
 well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort 
 
 harry stared not only was this the last answer expected but lupin had said name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore 
 
 clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic 
 
 i think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors 
 
 i see said lupin thoughtfully well impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry 
 
 harry know what to say to that so he drank some more tea 
 
 so been thinking that i believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly 
 
 wellyeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors 
 
 he was interrupted by a knock on the door 
 
 come in called lupin 
 
 the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing 
 
 ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me 
 
 snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin 
 
 i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank 
 
 fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin 
 
 yes yes i will said lupin 
 
 i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more 
 
 i should probably have some again tomorrow thanks very much severus 
 
 not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful 
 
 harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
 
 professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering 
 
 why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question 
 
 been feeling a bit he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there many wizards who are up to making it 
 
 professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands 
 
 professor very interested in the dark arts he blurted out 
 
 really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion 
 
 some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job 
 
 lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face 
 
 disgusting he said well harry better get back to work see you at the feast later 
 
 right said harry putting down his empty teacup 
 
 the empty goblet was still smoking 
 
 
 
 there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
 
 a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room from the cold wind and looking as though had the time of their lives 
 
 thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps hogsmeade like where did you go 
 
 by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides 
 
 the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all depending on how fast you want your letter to get there 
 
 honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples a bit look 
 
 we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks 
 
 wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up 
 
 what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done 
 
 no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in 
 
 he told them all about the goblet mouth fell open 
 
 lupin drank it he gasped is he mad 
 
 hermione checked her watch 
 
 better go down you know the be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape 
 
 but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he have done it in front of harry 
 
 yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes 
 
 the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural 
 
 the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
 
 it had been such a pleasant evening that good mood even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students 
 
 why anyone going in said ron curiously 
 
 harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed 
 
 let me through please came voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd the holdup here you all have forgotten the password excuse me head boy 
 
 and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick 
 
 heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe 
 
 going on said ginny who had just arrived 
 
 a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was 
 
 oh my hermione grabbed arm 
 
 the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him 
 
 we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady 
 
 be lucky said a cackling voice 
 
 it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry 
 
 what do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and grin faded a little he dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir want to be seen a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly 
 
 did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly 
 
 oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper got that sirius black

lionfish nov chapter eight the quidditch world cupcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 clutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it 
 
 seats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away againbless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards 
 
 prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can go 
 
 the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined 
 
 a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field 
 
 the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with buzzermrs all purpose magical mess remover no pain no wizardwear london paris hogsmeade 
 harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiar 
 
 dobby said harry incredulously 
 
 the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it dobby it was however unmistakably a as friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy family 
 
 did sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interest 
 
 sorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knew 
 
 but i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon scar you is surely harry potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry 
 
 but dobby talks of you all the time sir she said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck 
 
 how is he said harry freedom suiting him 
 
 ah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him free 
 
 why said harry taken aback wrong with him 
 
 freedom is going to head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir get another position sir 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 winky lowered her voice by a and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sir 
 
 paying said harry blankly well why he be paid 
 
 winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was again 
 
 is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblin 
 
 well about time he had a bit of fun said harry 
 
 is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir 
 
 he sent you up here if he knows you like heights said harry frowning 
 
 master master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good 
 
 she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the others 
 
 so a ron muttered weird things they 
 
 dobby was weirder said harry fervently 
 
 ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium 
 
 wild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose againand againand again 
 
 hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled program 
 
 a display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloud 
 
 oh always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a show 
 
 the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him 
 
 harry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and seem to understand a word of english harry potteroh come on now you know who he isthe boy who survived do know who he is 
 
 the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at it 
 
 knew get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his saving him a job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best placesah and lucius 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be mother 
 
 harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been if she been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose 
 
 ah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i think met my wife narcissa or our son draco 
 
 how do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well the bulgarian minister of magic and he understand a word saying anyway so never mind and see who else you know arthur weasley i daresay 
 
 it was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the row 
 
 good lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house have fetched this much 
 
 fudge who listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur here as my guest 
 
 how how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smile 
 
 mr eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and father 
 
 slimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the box 
 
 everyone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to go 
 
 ready when you are ludo said fudge comfortably 
 
 ludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemenwelcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and quidditch world cup 
 
 the spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland 
 
 and now without further ado allow me to introducethe bulgarian national team mascots 
 
 the side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approval 
 
 i wonder what brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veela 
 
 what are veel 
 
 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and question was answered for him veela were womenthe most beautiful women harry had ever seenexcept that they they be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine like that or their hair fan out behind them without windbut then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all 
 
 the veela had started to dance and mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen 
 
 and as the veela danced faster and faster wild thoughts started chasing through dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good ideabut would it be good enough 
 
 harry what are you doing said voice from a long way off 
 
 the music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard 
 
 angry yells were filling the stadium the crowd want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands 
 
 be wanting that he said once ireland have had their say 
 
 huh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the field 
 
 hermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she said 
 
 and now roared ludo voice kindly put your wands in the airfor the irish national team mascots 
 
 next moment what seemed to be a great comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it 
 
 excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green 
 
 leprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold 
 
 there you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into hand for the omnioculars now got to buy me a christmas present ha 
 
 the great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves to watch the match 
 
 and now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrov 
 
 a figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters 
 
 ivanova 
 
 a second player zoomed out 
 
 zograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krum 
 
 him him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his own 
 
 viktor krum was thin dark and with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteen 
 
 and now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch 
 
 seven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backs 
 
 and here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafa 
 
 a small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the balls 
 
 off screamed bagman and mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moran 
 
 it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums 
 
 hawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to ireland 
 
 what harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but got the quaffle 
 
 harry if not going to watch at normal speed going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkily 
 
 furious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed 
 
 harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the supporters 
 
 the match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score first goal 
 
 fingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle 
 
 dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagman 
 
 one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was 
 
 going to crash screamed hermione next to harry 
 
 she was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seats 
 
 fool moaned mr weasley krum was feinting 
 
 yelled voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynch 
 
 be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking which is what krum was after of course 
 
 harry hastily pressed the replay and buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyes 
 
 he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference 
 
 lynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far 
 
 after fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtier 
 
 as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a foul 
 
 and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes a penalty to ireland 
 
 the leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha 
 
 the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again 
 
 as one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who bothered was soon tugging on arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears 
 
 look at the referee she said giggling 
 
 harry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly 
 
 now we have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the referee 
 
 a mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous 
 
 and unless much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said voice now something we seen beforeoh this could turn nasty 
 
 it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle 
 
 two penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those broomsyesthere they goand troy takes the quaffle 
 
 play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broom 
 
 foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green 
 
 foul echoed ludo magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and got to be another penalty yes the whistle 
 
 the leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders 
 
 and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks alone 
 
 ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet 
 
 levski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scores 
 
 but the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov 
 
 the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the face 
 
 there was a deafening groan from the crowd nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight 
 
 harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the same 
 
 ah come on he play like that look at him 
 
 look at lynch harry yelled 
 
 for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing 
 
 seen the snitch harry shouted seen it look at him go 
 
 half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker onbut krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again 
 
 going to crash shrieked hermione 
 
 not roared ron 
 
 lynch is yelled harry 
 
 and he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela 
 
 the snitch the snitch bellowed charlie along the row 
 
 got it got it all over shouted harry 
 
 krum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand 
 
 the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight 
 
 ireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match 
 
 krum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i think any of us were expecting that 
 
 what did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiot 
 
 he knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too goodhe wanted to end it on his terms all 
 
 he was very brave he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess 
 
 harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlorn 
 
 vell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic 
 
 you can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and been letting me mime everything all day 
 
 veil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shrugging 
 
 and as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagman 
 
 eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that been using sign language all day for nothing 
 
 have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shouted 
 
 and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction 
 
 one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly and distinctly but when name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roar 
 
 and then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval hands were numb with clapping 
 
 at last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietus 
 
 be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist it have lasted yesyes i owe much 
 
 for fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched

 clutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it 
 
 seats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away againbless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards 
 
 prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can go 
 
 the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined 
 
 a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field 
 
 the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with buzzermrs all purpose magical mess remover no pain no wizardwear london paris hogsmeade 
 harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiar 
 
 dobby said harry incredulously 
 
 the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it dobby it was however unmistakably a as friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy family 
 
 did sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interest 
 
 sorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knew 
 
 but i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon scar you is surely harry potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry 
 
 but dobby talks of you all the time sir she said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck 
 
 how is he said harry freedom suiting him 
 
 ah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him free 
 
 why said harry taken aback wrong with him 
 
 freedom is going to head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir get another position sir 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 winky lowered her voice by a and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sir 
 
 paying said harry blankly well why he be paid 
 
 winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was again 
 
 is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblin 
 
 well about time he had a bit of fun said harry 
 
 is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir 
 
 he sent you up here if he knows you like heights said harry frowning 
 
 master master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good 
 
 she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the others 
 
 so a ron muttered weird things they 
 
 dobby was weirder said harry fervently 
 
 ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium 
 
 wild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose againand againand again 
 
 hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled program 
 
 a display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloud 
 
 oh always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a show 
 
 the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him 
 
 harry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and seem to understand a word of english harry potteroh come on now you know who he isthe boy who survived do know who he is 
 
 the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at it 
 
 knew get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his saving him a job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best placesah and lucius 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be mother 
 
 harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been if she been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose 
 
 ah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i think met my wife narcissa or our son draco 
 
 how do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well the bulgarian minister of magic and he understand a word saying anyway so never mind and see who else you know arthur weasley i daresay 
 
 it was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the row 
 
 good lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house have fetched this much 
 
 fudge who listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur here as my guest 
 
 how how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smile 
 
 mr eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and father 
 
 slimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the box 
 
 everyone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to go 
 
 ready when you are ludo said fudge comfortably 
 
 ludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemenwelcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and quidditch world cup 
 
 the spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland 
 
 and now without further ado allow me to introducethe bulgarian national team mascots 
 
 the side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approval 
 
 i wonder what brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veela 
 
 what are veel 
 
 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and question was answered for him veela were womenthe most beautiful women harry had ever seenexcept that they they be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine like that or their hair fan out behind them without windbut then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all 
 
 the veela had started to dance and mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen 
 
 and as the veela danced faster and faster wild thoughts started chasing through dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good ideabut would it be good enough 
 
 harry what are you doing said voice from a long way off 
 
 the music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard 
 
 angry yells were filling the stadium the crowd want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands 
 
 be wanting that he said once ireland have had their say 
 
 huh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the field 
 
 hermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she said 
 
 and now roared ludo voice kindly put your wands in the airfor the irish national team mascots 
 
 next moment what seemed to be a great comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it 
 
 excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green 
 
 leprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold 
 
 there you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into hand for the omnioculars now got to buy me a christmas present ha 
 
 the great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves to watch the match 
 
 and now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrov 
 
 a figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters 
 
 ivanova 
 
 a second player zoomed out 
 
 zograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krum 
 
 him him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his own 
 
 viktor krum was thin dark and with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteen 
 
 and now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch 
 
 seven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backs 
 
 and here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafa 
 
 a small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the balls 
 
 off screamed bagman and mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moran 
 
 it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums 
 
 hawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to ireland 
 
 what harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but got the quaffle 
 
 harry if not going to watch at normal speed going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkily 
 
 furious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed 
 
 harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the supporters 
 
 the match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score first goal 
 
 fingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle 
 
 dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagman 
 
 one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was 
 
 going to crash screamed hermione next to harry 
 
 she was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seats 
 
 fool moaned mr weasley krum was feinting 
 
 yelled voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynch 
 
 be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking which is what krum was after of course 
 
 harry hastily pressed the replay and buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyes 
 
 he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference 
 
 lynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far 
 
 after fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtier 
 
 as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a foul 
 
 and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes a penalty to ireland 
 
 the leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha 
 
 the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again 
 
 as one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who bothered was soon tugging on arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears 
 
 look at the referee she said giggling 
 
 harry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly 
 
 now we have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the referee 
 
 a mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous 
 
 and unless much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said voice now something we seen beforeoh this could turn nasty 
 
 it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle 
 
 two penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those broomsyesthere they goand troy takes the quaffle 
 
 play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broom 
 
 foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green 
 
 foul echoed ludo magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and got to be another penalty yes the whistle 
 
 the leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders 
 
 and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks alone 
 
 ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet 
 
 levski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scores 
 
 but the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov 
 
 the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the face 
 
 there was a deafening groan from the crowd nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight 
 
 harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the same 
 
 ah come on he play like that look at him 
 
 look at lynch harry yelled 
 
 for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing 
 
 seen the snitch harry shouted seen it look at him go 
 
 half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker onbut krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again 
 
 going to crash shrieked hermione 
 
 not roared ron 
 
 lynch is yelled harry 
 
 and he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela 
 
 the snitch the snitch bellowed charlie along the row 
 
 got it got it all over shouted harry 
 
 krum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand 
 
 the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight 
 
 ireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match 
 
 krum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i think any of us were expecting that 
 
 what did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiot 
 
 he knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too goodhe wanted to end it on his terms all 
 
 he was very brave he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess 
 
 harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlorn 
 
 vell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic 
 
 you can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and been letting me mime everything all day 
 
 veil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shrugging 
 
 and as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagman 
 
 eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that been using sign language all day for nothing 
 
 have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shouted 
 
 and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction 
 
 one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly and distinctly but when name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roar 
 
 and then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval hands were numb with clapping 
 
 at last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietus 
 
 be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist it have lasted yesyes i owe much 
 
 for fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched 
 
 rowling

 harry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this was the place he had visited inside pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban 
 
 the walls were made of dark stone dimly lit by torches empty benches rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest benches of all were many shadowy figures they had been talking in low voices but as the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fell 
 
 a cold male voice rang across the courtroom 
 
 late 
 
 sorry said harry nervously ii know the time had been changed 
 
 that is not the fault said the voice an owl was sent to you this morning take your seat 
 
 harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room the arms of which were covered in chains he had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above 
 
 there were about fifty of them all as far as he could see wearing robes with an elaborately worked silver w on the side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him some with very austere expressions others looks of frank curiosity 
 
 in the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister for magic fudge was a portly man who often sported a bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad witch with very short grey hair sat on fudges left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudges right was another witch but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow 
 
 very well said fudge the accused being presentfinallylet us begin are you ready he called down the row 
 
 yes sir said an eager voice harry knew brother percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came eyes behind his glasses were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his hand 
 
 disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking notes at once into offences committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey 
 
 interrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley 
 
 witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck 
 
 dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long robes and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose 
 
 the members of the wizengamot were muttering all eyes were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witches in the back row however raised their hands and waved in welcome 
 
 a powerful emotion had risen in chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to catch eye but dumbledore was not looking his way he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudge 
 
 ah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes youergot ourer message that the time anderplace of the hearing had been changed then 
 
 i must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hours early so no harm done 
 
 yeswelli suppose need another chairiweasley could you 
 
 not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle down 
 
 yes said fudge again shuffling his notes well then so the charges yes 
 
 he extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read out the charges against the accused are as follows that he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a area in the presence of a muggle on the second of august at minutes past nine which constitutes an offence under paragraph c of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy 
 
 you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchment 
 
 yes harry said 
 
 you received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three years ago did you not 
 
 yes but 
 
 and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudge 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen 
 
 yes but 
 
 knowing that you were in an area full of muggles 
 
 yes but 
 
 fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the time 
 
 yes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were 
 
 the witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice 
 
 you produced a patronus 
 
 yes said harry because 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 awhat said harry 
 
 your patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it was more than vapour or smoke 
 
 yes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate a stag always a stag 
 
 always boomed madam bones you have produced a patronus before now 
 
 yes said harry been doing it for over a year 
 
 and you are fifteen years old 
 
 yes and 
 
 you learned this at school 
 
 yes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the 
 
 impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at his age very impressive indeed 
 
 some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their heads 
 
 not a question of how impressive the magic was said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a muggle 
 
 those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it was the sight of sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speech 
 
 i did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him again 
 
 he had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before 
 
 dementors said madam bones after a moment her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boy 
 
 i mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin 
 
 ah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the wizengamot as though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought be hearing something like this 
 
 dementors in little whinging madam bones said in a tone of great surprise i understand 
 
 you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so just your word and no witnesses 
 
 not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it 
 
 enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face sorry to interrupt what sure would have been a very story 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent again 
 
 we do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i mean 
 
 plump face seemed to slacken as though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we got time to listen to more tarradiddles afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly 
 
 i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of rights the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bones he continued addressing the witch in the monocle 
 
 true said madam bones perfectly true 
 
 oh very well very well snapped fudge where is this person 
 
 i brought her with me said dumbledore just outside the door should i 
 
 noweasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once ran down the stone steps from the balcony and hurried past dumbledore and harry without glancing at them 
 
 a moment later percy returned followed by mrs figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers 
 
 dumbledore stood up and gave mrs figg his chair conjuring a second one for himself 
 
 full name said fudge loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat 
 
 arabella doreen figg said mrs figg in her quavery voice 
 
 and who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voice 
 
 a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter lives said mrs figg 
 
 we have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bones at once that situation has always been closely monitored given given past events 
 
 a squib said mrs figg so you have me registered would you 
 
 a squib eh said fudge eyeing her closely be checking that leave details of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squibs see dementors he added looking left and right along the bench 
 
 yes we can said mrs figg indignantly 
 
 fudge looked back down at her his eyebrows raised very well he said aloofly what is your story 
 
 i had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk around about nine on the evening of the second of august gabbled mrs figg at once as though she had learned what she was saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running 
 
 running said madam bones sharply dementors run they glide 
 
 what i meant to say said mrs figg quickly patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys 
 
 what did they look like said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh 
 
 well one was very large and the other one rather skinny 
 
 no no said madam bones impatiently the dementors describe them 
 
 oh said mrs figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloaks 
 
 harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mrs figg might say it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air 
 
 in the second row a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour a witch she smirked and nodded 
 
 big and wearing cloaks repeated madam bones coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything else 
 
 yes said mrs figg i felt them everything went cold and this was a very warm night mark you and i felt as though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful things 
 
 her voice shook and died 
 
 madam eyes widened slightly harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it 
 
 what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope 
 
 they went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely 
 
 madam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively what you saw is it 
 
 that is what happened mrs figg repeated 
 
 very well said fudge you may go 
 
 mrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind her 
 
 not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily 
 
 oh i know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i imagine why she would say they were there if they 
 
 but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman have bet 
 
 oh i think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly 
 
 the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent 
 
 and what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icily 
 
 it means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore 
 
 i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge 
 
 not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter cornelius 
 
 yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to 
 
 then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august 
 
 in the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first time 
 
 he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue 
 
 the chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge 
 
 the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak 
 
 sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy 
 
 she gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused 
 
 if it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control 
 
 there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red 
 
 dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow 
 
 then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation 
 
 it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud 
 
 of course it said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated 
 
 he glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly 
 
 i would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 
 
 of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the 
 
 we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge 
 
 of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes 
 
 if there were dementors which i doubt 
 
 you have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted 
 
 if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object 
 
 ithatnot blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him want this over with today dumbledore 
 
 but naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore 
 
 serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago 
 
 that me it was a said harry 
 
 you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in direction a in a muggle house i ask you 
 
 the in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish 
 
 inoti got time to listen to anyway not the onlyhe blew up his aunt for sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the bench and upsetting a bottle of ink 
 
 and you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes 
 
 and i even started on what he gets up to at school 
 
 but as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words 
 
 oho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think so 
 
 the ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourself 
 
 laws can be changed said fudge savagely 
 
 of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic 
 
 a few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless 
 
 as far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdict 
 
 dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversations 
 
 harry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed 
 
 twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes 
 
 then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his laces 
 
 those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voice 
 
 head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of conviction 
 
 fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the wizard and the witch in the second row 
 
 fudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charges 
 
 excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all 
 
 and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix

 what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope 
 
 they went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely 
 
 madam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively what you saw is it 
 
 that is what happened mrs figg repeated 
 
 very well said fudge you may go 
 
 mrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind her 
 
 not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily 
 
 oh i know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i imagine why she would say they were there if they 
 
 but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman have bet 
 
 oh i think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly 
 
 the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent 
 
 and what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icily 
 
 it means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore 
 
 i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge 
 
 not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter cornelius 
 
 yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to 
 
 then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august 
 
 in the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first time 
 
 he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue 
 
 the chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge 
 
 the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak 
 
 sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy 
 
 she gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused 
 
 if it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control 
 
 there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red 
 
 dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow 
 
 then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation 
 
 it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud 
 
 of course it said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated 
 
 he glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly 
 
 i would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 
 
 of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the 
 
 we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge 
 
 of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes 
 
 if there were dementors which i doubt 
 
 you have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted 
 
 if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object 
 
 ithatnot blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him want this over with today dumbledore 
 
 but naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore 
 
 serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago 
 
 that me it was a said harry 
 
 you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in direction a in a muggle house i ask you 
 
 the in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish 
 
 inoti got time to listen to anyway not the onlyhe blew up his aunt for sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the bench and upsetting a bottle of ink 
 
 and you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes 
 
 and i even started on what he gets up to at school 
 
 but as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words 
 
 oho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think so 
 
 the ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourself 
 
 laws can be changed said fudge savagely 
 
 of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic 
 
 a few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless 
 
 as far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdict 
 
 dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversations 
 
 harry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed 
 
 twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes 
 
 then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his laces 
 
 those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voice 
 
 head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of conviction 
 
 fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the wizard and the witch in the second row 
 
 fudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charges 
 
 excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all 
 
 and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight snape victoriouscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could not move a muscle he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond his immediate thought was that someone would surely check the compartments before the train departed again but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard his best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him 
 
 harry had never hated malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth what a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk 
 
 ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them once they arrived at hogwarts and took their places in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london 
 
 he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible then he remembered that some wizards like dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened 
 
 he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where harry potter had gone a feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson 
 
 the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling the floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life the express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it 
 
 then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said wotcher harry 
 
 there was a flash of red light and body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away 
 
 better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on jump 
 
 harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view 
 
 the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak 
 
 who did it 
 
 draco malfoy said harry bitterly thanks for well 
 
 no problem said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she was as and as she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still 
 
 harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed and closed his eyes 
 
 episkey said tonks 
 
 nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt gingerly it seemed to be mended 
 
 thanks a lot 
 
 better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness 
 
 was that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this 
 
 yes sending word to the castle that got you or worry come on better not dawdle 
 
 they set off toward the lane that led to the school 
 
 how did you find me 
 
 i noticed you left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought check 
 
 but what are you doing here anyway harry asked 
 
 stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks 
 
 is it just you stationed up here or 
 
 no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too 
 
 dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year 
 
 right 
 
 they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it been her fault at all but he bring himself to do it he was far from blaming her for death it was no more her fault than anyone and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence long cloak whispering on the ground behind them 
 
 having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut 
 
 alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened 
 
 that work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself 
 
 harry looked around 
 
 i could climb a wall he suggested 
 
 no you said tonks flatly jinxes on all of them been tightened a hundredfold this summer 
 
 well then said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness i suppose just have to sleep out here and wait for morning 
 
 coming down for you said tonks look 
 
 a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape 
 
 well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance 
 
 i change i have my harry began but snape cut across him 
 
 there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quiteahsafe in my hands 
 
 i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning 
 
 hagrid was late for the feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him i was interested to see your new patronus 
 
 he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place 
 
 i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one looks weak 
 
 as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on face then she was covered in darkness once more 
 
 goodnight harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for everything 
 
 see you harry 
 
 snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness 
 
 fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the termwe even started pudding you might have set a record potter 
 
 the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he was late 
 
 i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape continued and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect 
 
 still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening 
 
 they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed 
 
 as though he had read mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted sure 
 
 harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow it was all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them 
 
 youblimey you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity 
 
 why wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection 
 
 covered in blood said hermione come here 
 
 she raised her wand said tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood 
 
 thanks said harry feeling his now clean face my nose looking 
 
 normal said hermoine anxiously why it harry what happened been terrified 
 
 tell you later said harry curtly he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop 
 
 but said hermione 
 
 not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could but there was always a chance it reach too many gryffindor ears 
 
 he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings 
 
 you missed the sorting anyway said hermione as ron dived for a large chocolate gateau 
 
 hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart 
 
 more of the same really advising us all to unite in the face enemies you know 
 
 dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all 
 
 not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast he it be long now 
 
 snape said hagrid was late for the feast 
 
 seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau 
 
 bumped into him said harry evasively 
 
 hagrid was only a few minutes late said hermione look waving at you harry 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the feast before she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill parents and attack harry himself the knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again what he would give to fight malfoy 
 
 so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked 
 
 to know what really happened at the ministry said harry 
 
 him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating us about it on the train they ron 
 
 yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one 
 
 there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust 
 
 not saying much seeing as already dead ron observed 
 
 once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly 
 
 the very best of evenings to you he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room 
 
 what happened to his hand gasped hermione 
 
 she was not the only one who had noticed right hand was as blackened and as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whispers swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his sleeve over his injury 
 
 nothing to worry about he said airily now to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you 
 
 his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer harry whispered to hermione i thought have cured it by now though or madam pomfrey done 
 
 it looks as if died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injuries you cure old curses and there are poisons without antidotes 
 
 and mr filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise 
 
 we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of potions master 
 
 potions 
 
 potions 
 
 the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right 
 
 potions said ron and hermione together turning to stare harry but you said 
 
 professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking the position of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 no said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it 
 
 but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 i thought he was said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching 
 
 snape who was sitting on right did not stand up his mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much 
 
 well one good thing he said savagely be gone by the end of the year 
 
 what do you mean asked ron 
 
 that jinxed no ones lasted more than a year quirrell actually died doing it personally going to keep my fingers crossed for another death 
 
 harry said hermione shocked and reproachful 
 
 he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay moody 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat harry ron and hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his desire seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing 
 
 now as everybody in this hall knows lord voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength 
 
 the silence seemed to tauten and strain as dumbledore spoke harry glanced at malfoy malfoy was not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the words unworthy of his attention 
 
 i cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe the magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff i urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find themin particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety 
 
 blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more 
 
 but now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be for your lessons tomorrow let us therefore say good night pip pip 
 
 with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of gryffindors to draw ahead of him hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her duty of shepherding the first years but ron remained with harry 
 
 what really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else 
 
 harry told him it was a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh 
 
 i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry bitterly listen to what he was saying before he found out i was there 
 
 harry had expected ron to be stunned by boasts with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron was unimpressed 
 
 come on harry he was just showing off for parkinson what kind of mission would have given him 
 
 how know voldemort need someone at hogwarts it be the first 
 
 i wish stop sayin tha name harry said a reproachful voice behind them harry looked over his shoulder to see hagtid shaking his head 
 
 dumbledore uses that name said harry stubbornly 
 
 yeah well dumbledore innit said hagrid mysteriously so how come yeh were late harry i was worried 
 
 got held up on the train said harry why were you late 
 
 i was with grawp said hagrid happily los track o the time got a new home up in the mountains now dumbledore fixed itnice big cave much happier than he was in the forest we were havin a good chat 
 
 really said harry taking care not to catch eye the last time he had met a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly 
 
 oh yeah really come on said hagrid proudly be amazed thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant 
 
 ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze they were now standing beside the oak front doors 
 
 anyway see yeh tomorrow firs straight after lunch come early an yeh can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings 
 
 raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the doors into the darkness 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other harry could tell that ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself 
 
 not taking care of magical creatures are you 
 
 ron shook his head and not either are you 
 
 harry shook his head too 
 
 and hermione said ron not is she 
 
 harry shook his head again exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think 
 
 rowling

 there was a flash of red light and body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away 
 
 better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on jump 
 
 harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view 
 
 the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak 
 
 who did it 
 
 draco malfoy said harry bitterly thanks for well 
 
 no problem said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she was as and as she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still 
 
 harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed and closed his eyes 
 
 episkey said tonks 
 
 nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt gingerly it seemed to be mended 
 
 thanks a lot 
 
 better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness 
 
 was that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this 
 
 yes sending word to the castle that got you or worry come on better not dawdle 
 
 they set off toward the lane that led to the school 
 
 how did you find me 
 
 i noticed you left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought check 
 
 but what are you doing here anyway harry asked 
 
 stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks 
 
 is it just you stationed up here or 
 
 no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too 
 
 dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year 
 
 right 
 
 they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it been her fault at all but he bring himself to do it he was far from blaming her for death it was no more her fault than anyone and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence long cloak whispering on the ground behind them 
 
 having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut 
 
 alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened 
 
 that work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself 
 
 harry looked around 
 
 i could climb a wall he suggested 
 
 no you said tonks flatly jinxes on all of them been tightened a hundredfold this summer 
 
 well then said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness i suppose just have to sleep out here and wait for morning 
 
 coming down for you said tonks look 
 
 a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape 
 
 well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance 
 
 i change i have my harry began but snape cut across him 
 
 there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quiteahsafe in my hands 
 
 i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning 
 
 hagrid was late for the feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him i was interested to see your new patronus 
 
 he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place 
 
 i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one looks weak 
 
 as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on face then she was covered in darkness once more 
 
 goodnight harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for everything 
 
 see you harry 
 
 snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness 
 
 fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the termwe even started pudding you might have set a record potter 
 
 the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he was late 
 
 i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape continued and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect 
 
 still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening 
 
 they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed 
 
 as though he had read mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted sure 
 
 harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow it was all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them 
 
 youblimey you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity 
 
 why wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection 
 
 covered in blood said hermione come here 
 
 she raised her wand said tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood 
 
 thanks said harry feeling his now clean face my nose looking 
 
 normal said hermoine anxiously why it harry what happened been terrified 
 
 tell you later said harry curtly he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop 
 
 but said hermione 
 
 not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could but there was always a chance it reach too many gryffindor ears 
 
 he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings 
 
 you missed the sorting anyway said hermione as ron dived for a large chocolate gateau 
 
 hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart 
 
 more of the same really advising us all to unite in the face enemies you know 
 
 dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all 
 
 not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast he it be long now 
 
 snape said hagrid was late for the feast 
 
 seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau 
 
 bumped into him said harry evasively 
 
 hagrid was only a few minutes late said hermione look waving at you harry 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the feast before she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill parents and attack harry himself the knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again what he would give to fight malfoy 
 
 so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked 
 
 to know what really happened at the ministry said harry 
 
 him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating us about it on the train they ron 
 
 yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one 
 
 there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust 
 
 not saying much seeing as already dead ron observed 
 
 once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly 
 
 the very best of evenings to you he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room 
 
 what happened to his hand gasped hermione 
 
 she was not the only one who had noticed right hand was as blackened and as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whispers swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his sleeve over his injury 
 
 nothing to worry about he said airily now to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you 
 
 his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer harry whispered to hermione i thought have cured it by now though or madam pomfrey done 
 
 it looks as if died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injuries you cure old curses and there are poisons without antidotes 
 
 and mr filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise 
 
 we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of potions master 
 
 potions 
 
 potions 
 
 the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right 
 
 potions said ron and hermione together turning to stare harry but you said 
 
 professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking the position of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 no said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it 
 
 but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 i thought he was said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching 
 
 snape who was sitting on right did not stand up his mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much 
 
 well one good thing he said savagely be gone by the end of the year 
 
 what do you mean asked ron 
 
 that jinxed no ones lasted more than a year quirrell actually died doing it personally going to keep my fingers crossed for another death 
 
 harry said hermione shocked and reproachful 
 
 he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay moody 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat harry ron and hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his desire seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing 
 
 now as everybody in this hall knows lord voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength 
 
 the silence seemed to tauten and strain as dumbledore spoke harry glanced at malfoy malfoy was not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the words unworthy of his attention 
 
 i cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe the magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff i urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find themin particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety 
 
 blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more 
 
 but now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be for your lessons tomorrow let us therefore say good night pip pip 
 
 with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of gryffindors to draw ahead of him hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her duty of shepherding the first years but ron remained with harry 
 
 what really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else 
 
 harry told him it was a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh 
 
 i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry bitterly listen to what he was saying before he found out i was there 
 
 harry had expected ron to be stunned by boasts with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron was unimpressed 
 
 come on harry he was just showing off for parkinson what kind of mission would have given him 
 
 how know voldemort need someone at hogwarts it be the first 
 
 i wish stop sayin tha name harry said a reproachful voice behind them harry looked over his shoulder to see hagtid shaking his head 
 
 dumbledore uses that name said harry stubbornly 
 
 yeah well dumbledore innit said hagrid mysteriously so how come yeh were late harry i was worried 
 
 got held up on the train said harry why were you late 
 
 i was with grawp said hagrid happily los track o the time got a new home up in the mountains now dumbledore fixed itnice big cave much happier than he was in the forest we were havin a good chat 
 
 really said harry taking care not to catch eye the last time he had met a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly 
 
 oh yeah really come on said hagrid proudly be amazed thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant 
 
 ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze they were now standing beside the oak front doors 
 
 anyway see yeh tomorrow firs straight after lunch come early an yeh can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings 
 
 raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the doors into the darkness 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other harry could tell that ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself 
 
 not taking care of magical creatures are you 
 
 ron shook his head and not either are you 
 
 harry shook his head too 
 
 and hermione said ron not is she 
 
 harry shook his head again exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the weddingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 three oclock on the following afternoon found harry ron fred and george standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests harry had taken a large dose of polyjuice potion and was now the double of a redheaded muggle boy from the local village ottery st catchpole from whom fred had stolen hairs using a summoning charm the plan was to introduce harry as cousin barny and trust to the great number of weasley relatives to camouflage him 
 
 all four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats a host of waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a golden jacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot behind harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet the supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers fred and george had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where bill and fleur would shortly become husband and wife outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow harry was rather uncomfortable the muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summers day 
 
 when i get married said fred tugging at the collar of his own robes i wont be bothering with any of this nonsense you can all wear what you like and ill put a full body bird curse on mum until its all over 
 
 she wasnt too bad this morning considering said george cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look 
 
 brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent 
 
 excellent i think i see a few veela cousins said george craning his neck for a better look theyll need help understanding our english customs ill look after them 
 
 not so fast your holeyness said fred and darting past the gaggle of witches heading for the procession he said here c permetiez moi to assister vous to a pair of pretty french girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside george was left to deal with the witches and ron took charge of mr weasleys old perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to harrys lot 
 
 wotcher said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found tonks and lupin at the front of the queue she had turned blonde for the occasion arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair sorry about last night she added in a whisper as harry led them up the aisle the ministrys being very at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors 
 
 its fine i understand said harry speaking more to lupin than tonks lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away harry saw lupins face fall again into lines of misery he did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption having misunderstood freds directions as he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks 
 
 while mr weasley repaired the damage and hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen harry hurried back to the entrance to find ron with a most wizard slightly with white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an shade of yellow an odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck 
 
 xenophilius lovegood he said extending a hand to harry my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us but i think you know my luna he added to ron 
 
 yes said ron isnt she with you 
 
 she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes c or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi 
 
 ours do know a lot of excellent swear words said ron but i think fred and george taught them those 
 
 he led a party of warlocks into the marquee as luna rushed up 
 
 hello harry she said 
 
 er c my names barry said harry flummoxed 
 
 oh have you changed that too she asked brightly 
 
 how did you know 
 
 oh just your expression she said 
 
 like her father luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair once you get over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant at least there were no radishes dangling from her ears 
 
 xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between luna and harry biding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said daddy look c one of the gnomes actually bit me 
 
 how wonderful gnome saliva is enormously beneficial said mr lovegood seizing lunas outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today c perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in mermish c do not repress it you may have been gifted by the gernumblies 
 
 ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort 
 
 ron can laugh said luna serenely as harry led her and xenophilius toward their seats but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic 
 
 really said harry who had long since decided not to challenge luna or her fathers peculiar views are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though 
 
 oh its fine said luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking harry up and down you look smart i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know 
 
 as she drifted off after her father ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm her beaky nose eyes and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a flamingo 
 
 and your hairs much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra merlins beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet and who are you she barked at harry 
 
 oh yeah auntie muriel this is our cousin barny 
 
 another weasley you breed like gnomes isnt harry potter here i was hoping to meet him i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting 
 
 no c he couldnt come c 
 
 hmm made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara she shouted at harry you know and been in my family for centuries shes a girl but still c french well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long 
 
 ron gave harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time when next they met at the entrance harry had shown a dozen more people to their places the marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside 
 
 nightmare muriel is said ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dungbomb under her chair at diner dad always says shell have written them out of her will c like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going wow he added blinking rather rapidly as hermione came hurrying toward them you look great 
 
 always the tone of surprise said hermione though she smiled she was wearing a floaty dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny your muriel doesnt agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara she said oh dear is this the and then bad posture and skinny ankles 
 
 dont take it personally shes rude to everyone said ron 
 
 talking about muriel inquired george reemerging from the marquee with fred yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided old bat i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings 
 
 wasnt he the one who saw a grim and died hours later asked hermione 
 
 well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end conceded george 
 
 but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party said fred he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his c 
 
 yes he sounds a real charmer said hermione while harry roared with laughter 
 
 never married for some reason said ron 
 
 you amaze me said hermione 
 
 they were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to ron and said with his eyes on hermione you look vunderful 
 
 viktor she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size as she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said i didnt know you were c goodness c its lovely to see c how are you 
 
 rons ears had turned bright red again after glancing at krums invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly how come youre here 
 
 fleur invited me said krum eyebrows raised 
 
 harry who had no grudge against krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove krum from rons vicinity offered to show him his seat 
 
 your friend is not pleased to see me said krum as they entered the now packed marquee or is he a relative he added with a glance at harrys red curly hair 
 
 cousin harry muttered but krum was not really listening his appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins he was after all a famous quidditch player while people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him ron hermione fred and george came hurrying down the aisle 
 
 time to sit down fred told harry or were going to get run over by the bride 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their seats in the second row behind fred and george hermione looked rather pink and rons ears were still scarlet after a few moments he muttered to harry did you see hes grown a stupid little beard 
 
 harry gave a noncommittal grunt 
 
 a sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter mr and mrs weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives mrs weasley was wearing a set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat 
 
 a moment later bill and charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with larger white roses in their buttonholes fred and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons 
 
 ooooh said hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance 
 
 a great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as monsieur delacour and fleur came walking up the aisle fleur gliding monsieur delacour bouncing and beaming fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow while her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon ginny and gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once fleur had reached for him bill did not look as though he had ever met fenrit greyback 
 
 ladies and gentlemen said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock harry saw the same small wizard who had presided at dumbledores funeral now standing in front of bill and fleur we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls 
 
 yes my tiara set off the whole thing nicely said auntie muriel in a rather carrying whisper but i must say ginevras dress is far too low cut 
 
 ginny glanced around grinning winked at harry then quickly faced the front again harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to the afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds they seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal persons life a person without a scar on his forehead 
 
 do you william arthur take fleur isabelle 
 
 in the front row mrs weasley and madame delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that hagrid had taken out one of his own handkerchiefs hermione turned around and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears 
 
 then i declare you bonded for life 
 
 the wizard waved his hand high over the heads of bill and fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures as fred and george led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din 
 
 ladies and gentlemen called the wizard if you would please stand up 
 
 they all did so auntie muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again the scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small tables which all floated gracefully back to earth round it and the hand trooped toward a podium 
 
 smooth said ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches 
 
 we should go and congratulate them said hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and fleur had vanished amid a crowd of 
 
 well have time later shrugged ron snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to harry hermione cop hold lets grab a table not there nowhere near muriel c 
 
 ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for krum by the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied the emptiest was the one where luna sat alone 
 
 all right if we join you asked ron 
 
 oh yes she said happily daddys just gone to give bill and fleur our present 
 
 what is it a lifetimes supply of gurdyroots asked ron 
 
 hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught harry instead eyes watering in pain harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments 
 
 the band had begun to play bill and fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while mr weasley led madame delacour onto the floor followed by mr weasley and fleurs father 
 
 i like this song said luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms 
 
 shes great isnt she said ron admiringly always good value 
 
 but the smile vanished from his face at once viktor krum had dropped into lunas vacant seat hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time krum had not come to compliment her with a scowl on his face he said who is that man in the yellow 
 
 thats xenophilius lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours said ron his pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at xenophilius despite the clear provocation come and dance he added abruptly to hermione 
 
 she looked taken aback but pleased too and got up they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor 
 
 ah they are together now asked krum momentarily distracted 
 
 er c sort of said harry 
 
 who are you krum asked 
 
 barny weasley 
 
 they shook hands 
 
 you barny c you know this man lovegood well 
 
 no i only met him today why 
 
 krum glowered over the top of his drink watching xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor 
 
 because said krum if he vus not a guest of fleurs i vould dud him here and now for veering that filthy sign upon his chest 
 
 sign said harry looking over at xenophilius too the strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest why whats wrong with it 
 
 grindelvald that is grindelvalds sign 
 
 grindelwald the dark wizard dumbledore defeated 
 
 exactly 
 
 krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance of course he vos never powerful in this country they said he feared dumbledore c and rightly seeing how he vos finished but this c he pointed a finger at xenophilius c this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vall at durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive c until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better 
 
 krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at xenophilius harry felt perplexed it seemed incredibly unlikely that lunas father was a supporter of the dark arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular finlike shape 
 
 are you c er c quite sure its grindelwalds 
 
 i am not mistaken said krum coldly i walked past that sign for several years i know it vell 
 
 well theres a chance said harry that xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means the lovegoods are quite unusual he could have easily picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a snorkack or something 
 
 the cross section of a vot 
 
 well i dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them 
 
 harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining luna and her father 
 
 thats her he said pointing at luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges 
 
 vy is she doing that asked krum 
 
 probably trying to get rid of a wrackspurt said harry who recognized the symptoms 
 
 krum did not seem to know whether or not harry was making fun of him he drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs sparks flew out of the end 
 
 gregorovitch said harry loudly and krum started but harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of krums wand ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the triwizard tournament 
 
 vot about him asked krum suspiciously 
 
 hes a wandmaker 
 
 i know that said krum 
 
 he made your wand thats why i thought c quidditch c 
 
 krum was looking more and more suspicious 
 
 how do you know gregorovitch made my wand 
 
 ii read it somewhere i think said harry in a c a fan magazine he improvised wildly and krum looked mollified 
 
 i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans he said 
 
 so er where is gregorowitch these days 
 
 krum looked puzzled 
 
 he retired several years ago i was one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand they are the best calthough i know of course that your britons set much store by ollivander 
 
 harry did not answer he pretended to watch the dancers like krum but he was thinking hard so voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and harry did not have to search far for a reason it was surely because of what harry wand had done on the night that voldemort pursued him across the skies the holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand some thing that ollivander had not anticipated or understood would gregorowitch know better was he truly more skilled than ollivander did he know secrets of wands that ollivander did not 
 
 this girl is very krum said recalling harry to his surroundings krum was pointing at ginny who had just joined luna she is also a relative of yours 
 
 yeah said harry suddenly irritated and shes seeing someone jealous type big bloke you wouldnt want to cross him 
 
 krum grunted 
 
 vot he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the girls are taken 
 
 and he strode off leaving harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor he wanted to find ron to tell him about gregorovitch but he was dancing with hermione out in the middle of the floor harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched ginny who was now dancing with fred and georges friend lee jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given ron 
 
 he had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd as the evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained fred and george had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of fleurs cousins charlie hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing odo the hero in the corner 
 
 wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of rons who seemed unsure whether or not harry was his son harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table his cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a fez he was vaguely familiar racking his brains harry suddenly realized that this was elphias doge member of the order of the phoenix and the writer of dumbledores obituary 
 
 harry approached him 
 
 may i sit down 
 
 of course of course said doge he had a rather wheezy voice 
 
 harry leaned in 
 
 mr doge im harry potter 
 
 doge gasped 
 
 my dear boy arthur told me you were here disguised i am so glad so honored 
 
 in a flutter of nervous pleasure doge poured harry a goblet of champagne 
 
 i thought of writing to you he whispered after dumbledore the shock and for you i am sure 
 
 doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears 
 
 i saw the obituary you wrote for the daily prophet said harry i didnt realize you knew professor dumbledore so well 
 
 as well as anyone said doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin certainly i knew him longest if you dont count aberforth c and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth 
 
 speaking of the daily prophet i dont know whether you saw mr doge 
 
 oh please call me elphias dear boy 
 
 elphias i dont know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore 
 
 doges face flooded with angry color 
 
 oh yes harry i saw it that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you my have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity 
 
 well in that interview harry went on rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young 
 
 dont believe a word of it said doge at once not a word harry let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore 
 
 harry looked into doges earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated did doge really think it was that easy that harry could simply choose not to believe didnt doge understand harrys need to be sure to know everything 
 
 perhaps doge suspected harrys feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on harry rita skeeter is a dreadful c 
 
 but he was interrupted by a shrill cackle 
 
 rita skeeter oh i love her always read her 
 
 harry and doge looked up to see auntie muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hair a goblet of champagne in her hand shes written a book about dumbledore you know 
 
 hello muriel said doge yes we were just discussing c 
 
 you there give me your chair im a hundred and seven 
 
 another redheaded weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and auntie muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between doge and harry 
 
 hello again barry or whatever your name is she said to harry now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know shes written a biography of dumbledore i cant wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts 
 
 doge looked stiff and solemn at this but auntie muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement she took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus 
 
 sniping said doge turning again 
 
 you would say that elphias cackled auntie muriel i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours 
 
 im sorry you think so said doge more coldly still i assure you i was writing from the heart 
 
 oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister 
 
 muriel exclaimed doge 
 
 a chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through harrys chest 
 
 what do you mean he asked muriel who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill 
 
 thought wrong then didnt you barry said auntie muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened thats why i cant wait to find out what skeeters unearthed dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time 
 
 untrue wheezed doge absolutely untrue 
 
 he never told me his sister as a squib said harry without thinking still cold inside 
 
 and why on earth would he tell you screeched muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon harry 
 
 the reason albus never spoke about ariana began elphias in a voice stiff with emotion is i should have thought quite clear he was so devastated by her death c 
 
 why did nobody ever see her elphias squawked muriel why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house 
 
 what dyou mean locked in the cellar asked harry what is this 
 
 doge looked wretched auntie muriel cackled again and answered harry 
 
 dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying though i heard she pretended otherwise 
 
 she never pretended anything of the sort kendra was a fine woman whispered doge miserably but auntie muriel ignored him 
 
 proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib 
 
 ariana was not a squib wheezed doge 
 
 so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts said auntie muriel she turned back to harry in our day squibs were often hushed up thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist c 
 
 i tell you thats not what happened said doge but auntie muriel steamrollered on still addressing harry 
 
 squibs were usually shipped off to muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally kendra dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a muggle school c 
 
 ariana was delicate said doge desperately her health was always too poor to permit her c 
 
 to permit her to leave the house cackled muriel and yet she was never taken to st mungos and no healer was ever summoned to see her 
 
 really muriel how can you possibly know whether c 
 
 for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there all most suspicious lancelot thought 
 
 doge looked to be on the verge of tears auntie muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne numbly harry thought of how the dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard had dumbledores sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic and had dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented 
 
 now if kendra hadnt died first muriel resumed id have said that it was she who finished off ariana c 
 
 how can you muriel groaned doge a mother kill her own daughter think what youre saying 
 
 if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not shrugged auntie muriel but as i say it doesnt fit because kendra died before ariana c of what nobody ever seemed sure 
 
 yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle said auntie muriel thoughtfully shake your head all you like elphias you were at arianas funeral were you not 
 
 yes i was said doge through trembling lips and a more desperately sad occasion i cannot remember albus was heartbroken 
 
 his heart wasnt the only thing didnt aberforth break albus nose halfway through the service 
 
 if doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now muriel might have stabbed him she cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin 
 
 how do you croaked doge 
 
 my mother was friendly with old bathilda bagshot said auntie muriel happily bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door a brawl the way bathilda told it aberforth shouted that it was all albus fault that ariana was dead and then punched him in the face according to bathilda albus did not even defend himself and thats odd enough in itself albus could have destroyed aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back 
 
 muriel swigged yet more champagne the recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified doge harry did not know what to think what to believe he wanted the truth and yet all doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that ariana had been ill harry could hardly believe that dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story 
 
 and ill tell you something else muriel said hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter all those hints in skeeters interview about an important source close to the dumbledores c goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit 
 
 bathilda would never talk to rita skeeter whispered doge 
 
 bathilda bagshot harry said the author of a history of magic 
 
 the name was printed on the front of one of harrys textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively 
 
 yes said doge clutching at harrys question like a drowning man at a life heir a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albuss 
 
 quite gaga these days ive heard said auntie muriel cheerfully 
 
 if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her said doge and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said 
 
 oh there are ways of bringing back memories and im sure rita skeeter knows them all said auntie muriel but even if bathildas completely cuckoo im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters she knew the dumbledores for years well worth a trip to godrics hollow id have thought 
 
 harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked doge banged him on the back as harry coughed looking at auntie muriel through streaming eyes once he had control of his voice again he asked bathilda bagshot lives in godrics hollow 
 
 oh yes shes been there forever the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor 
 
 the dumbledores lived in godrics hollows 
 
 yes barry thats what i just said said auntie muriel testily 
 
 harry felt drained empty never once in six years had dumbledore told harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in godrics hollow why were lily and james buried close to dumbledores mother and sister had dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past lilys and jamess to do so and he had never once told harry never bothered to say 
 
 and why it was so important harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common he stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him 
 
 i simply cant dance anymore she panted slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot rons gone looking to find more butterbeers its a bit odd ive just seen viktor storming away from lunas father it looked like theyd been arguing c she dropped her voice staring at him harry are you okay 
 
 harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter at that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in then the patronuss mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 the ministry has fallen scrimgeour is dead they are coming 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the weddingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 three oclock on the following afternoon found harry ron fred and george standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests harry had taken a large dose of polyjuice potion and was now the double of a redheaded muggle boy from the local village ottery st catchpole from whom fred had stolen hairs using a summoning charm the plan was to introduce harry as cousin barny and trust to the great number of weasley relatives to camouflage him 
 
 all four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats a host of waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a golden jacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot behind harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet the supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers fred and george had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where bill and fleur would shortly become husband and wife outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow harry was rather uncomfortable the muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summers day 
 
 when i get married said fred tugging at the collar of his own robes i wont be bothering with any of this nonsense you can all wear what you like and ill put a full body bird curse on mum until its all over 
 
 she wasnt too bad this morning considering said george cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look 
 
 brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent 
 
 excellent i think i see a few veela cousins said george craning his neck for a better look theyll need help understanding our english customs ill look after them 
 
 not so fast your holeyness said fred and darting past the gaggle of witches heading for the procession he said here c permetiez moi to assister vous to a pair of pretty french girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside george was left to deal with the witches and ron took charge of mr weasleys old perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to harrys lot 
 
 wotcher said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found tonks and lupin at the front of the queue she had turned blonde for the occasion arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair sorry about last night she added in a whisper as harry led them up the aisle the ministrys being very at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors 
 
 its fine i understand said harry speaking more to lupin than tonks lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away harry saw lupins face fall again into lines of misery he did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption having misunderstood freds directions as he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks 
 
 while mr weasley repaired the damage and hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen harry hurried back to the entrance to find ron with a most wizard slightly with white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an shade of yellow an odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck 
 
 xenophilius lovegood he said extending a hand to harry my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us but i think you know my luna he added to ron 
 
 yes said ron isnt she with you 
 
 she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes c or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi 
 
 ours do know a lot of excellent swear words said ron but i think fred and george taught them those 
 
 he led a party of warlocks into the marquee as luna rushed up 
 
 hello harry she said 
 
 er c my names barry said harry flummoxed 
 
 oh have you changed that too she asked brightly 
 
 how did you know 
 
 oh just your expression she said 
 
 like her father luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair once you get over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant at least there were no radishes dangling from her ears 
 
 xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between luna and harry biding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said daddy look c one of the gnomes actually bit me 
 
 how wonderful gnome saliva is enormously beneficial said mr lovegood seizing lunas outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today c perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in mermish c do not repress it you may have been gifted by the gernumblies 
 
 ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort 
 
 ron can laugh said luna serenely as harry led her and xenophilius toward their seats but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic 
 
 really said harry who had long since decided not to challenge luna or her fathers peculiar views are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though 
 
 oh its fine said luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking harry up and down you look smart i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know 
 
 as she drifted off after her father ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm her beaky nose eyes and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a flamingo 
 
 and your hairs much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra merlins beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet and who are you she barked at harry 
 
 oh yeah auntie muriel this is our cousin barny 
 
 another weasley you breed like gnomes isnt harry potter here i was hoping to meet him i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting 
 
 no c he couldnt come c 
 
 hmm made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara she shouted at harry you know and been in my family for centuries shes a girl but still c french well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long 
 
 ron gave harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time when next they met at the entrance harry had shown a dozen more people to their places the marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside 
 
 nightmare muriel is said ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dungbomb under her chair at diner dad always says shell have written them out of her will c like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going wow he added blinking rather rapidly as hermione came hurrying toward them you look great 
 
 always the tone of surprise said hermione though she smiled she was wearing a floaty dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny your muriel doesnt agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara she said oh dear is this the and then bad posture and skinny ankles 
 
 dont take it personally shes rude to everyone said ron 
 
 talking about muriel inquired george reemerging from the marquee with fred yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided old bat i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings 
 
 wasnt he the one who saw a grim and died hours later asked hermione 
 
 well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end conceded george 
 
 but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party said fred he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his c 
 
 yes he sounds a real charmer said hermione while harry roared with laughter 
 
 never married for some reason said ron 
 
 you amaze me said hermione 
 
 they were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to ron and said with his eyes on hermione you look vunderful 
 
 viktor she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size as she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said i didnt know you were c goodness c its lovely to see c how are you 
 
 rons ears had turned bright red again after glancing at krums invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly how come youre here 
 
 fleur invited me said krum eyebrows raised 
 
 harry who had no grudge against krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove krum from rons vicinity offered to show him his seat 
 
 your friend is not pleased to see me said krum as they entered the now packed marquee or is he a relative he added with a glance at harrys red curly hair 
 
 cousin harry muttered but krum was not really listening his appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins he was after all a famous quidditch player while people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him ron hermione fred and george came hurrying down the aisle 
 
 time to sit down fred told harry or were going to get run over by the bride 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their seats in the second row behind fred and george hermione looked rather pink and rons ears were still scarlet after a few moments he muttered to harry did you see hes grown a stupid little beard 
 
 harry gave a noncommittal grunt 
 
 a sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter mr and mrs weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives mrs weasley was wearing a set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat 
 
 a moment later bill and charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with larger white roses in their buttonholes fred and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons 
 
 ooooh said hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance 
 
 a great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as monsieur delacour and fleur came walking up the aisle fleur gliding monsieur delacour bouncing and beaming fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow while her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon ginny and gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once fleur had reached for him bill did not look as though he had ever met fenrit greyback 
 
 ladies and gentlemen said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock harry saw the same small wizard who had presided at dumbledores funeral now standing in front of bill and fleur we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls 
 
 yes my tiara set off the whole thing nicely said auntie muriel in a rather carrying whisper but i must say ginevras dress is far too low cut 
 
 ginny glanced around grinning winked at harry then quickly faced the front again harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to the afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds they seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal persons life a person without a scar on his forehead 
 
 do you william arthur take fleur isabelle 
 
 in the front row mrs weasley and madame delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that hagrid had taken out one of his own handkerchiefs hermione turned around and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears 
 
 then i declare you bonded for life 
 
 the wizard waved his hand high over the heads of bill and fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures as fred and george led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din 
 
 ladies and gentlemen called the wizard if you would please stand up 
 
 they all did so auntie muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again the scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small tables which all floated gracefully back to earth round it and the hand trooped toward a podium 
 
 smooth said ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches 
 
 we should go and congratulate them said hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and fleur had vanished amid a crowd of 
 
 well have time later shrugged ron snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to harry hermione cop hold lets grab a table not there nowhere near muriel c 
 
 ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for krum by the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied the emptiest was the one where luna sat alone 
 
 all right if we join you asked ron 
 
 oh yes she said happily daddys just gone to give bill and fleur our present 
 
 what is it a lifetimes supply of gurdyroots asked ron 
 
 hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught harry instead eyes watering in pain harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments 
 
 the band had begun to play bill and fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while mr weasley led madame delacour onto the floor followed by mr weasley and fleurs father 
 
 i like this song said luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms 
 
 shes great isnt she said ron admiringly always good value 
 
 but the smile vanished from his face at once viktor krum had dropped into lunas vacant seat hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time krum had not come to compliment her with a scowl on his face he said who is that man in the yellow 
 
 thats xenophilius lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours said ron his pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at xenophilius despite the clear provocation come and dance he added abruptly to hermione 
 
 she looked taken aback but pleased too and got up they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor 
 
 ah they are together now asked krum momentarily distracted 
 
 er c sort of said harry 
 
 who are you krum asked 
 
 barny weasley 
 
 they shook hands 
 
 you barny c you know this man lovegood well 
 
 no i only met him today why 
 
 krum glowered over the top of his drink watching xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor 
 
 because said krum if he vus not a guest of fleurs i vould dud him here and now for veering that filthy sign upon his chest 
 
 sign said harry looking over at xenophilius too the strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest why whats wrong with it 
 
 grindelvald that is grindelvalds sign 
 
 grindelwald the dark wizard dumbledore defeated 
 
 exactly 
 
 krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance of course he vos never powerful in this country they said he feared dumbledore c and rightly seeing how he vos finished but this c he pointed a finger at xenophilius c this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vall at durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive c until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better 
 
 krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at xenophilius harry felt perplexed it seemed incredibly unlikely that lunas father was a supporter of the dark arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular finlike shape 
 
 are you c er c quite sure its grindelwalds 
 
 i am not mistaken said krum coldly i walked past that sign for several years i know it vell 
 
 well theres a chance said harry that xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means the lovegoods are quite unusual he could have easily picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a snorkack or something 
 
 the cross section of a vot 
 
 well i dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them 
 
 harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining luna and her father 
 
 thats her he said pointing at luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges 
 
 vy is she doing that asked krum 
 
 probably trying to get rid of a wrackspurt said harry who recognized the symptoms 
 
 krum did not seem to know whether or not harry was making fun of him he drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs sparks flew out of the end 
 
 gregorovitch said harry loudly and krum started but harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of krums wand ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the triwizard tournament 
 
 vot about him asked krum suspiciously 
 
 hes a wandmaker 
 
 i know that said krum 
 
 he made your wand thats why i thought c quidditch c 
 
 krum was looking more and more suspicious 
 
 how do you know gregorovitch made my wand 
 
 ii read it somewhere i think said harry in a c a fan magazine he improvised wildly and krum looked mollified 
 
 i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans he said 
 
 so er where is gregorowitch these days 
 
 krum looked puzzled 
 
 he retired several years ago i was one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand they are the best calthough i know of course that your britons set much store by ollivander 
 
 harry did not answer he pretended to watch the dancers like krum but he was thinking hard so voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and harry did not have to search far for a reason it was surely because of what harry wand had done on the night that voldemort pursued him across the skies the holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand some thing that ollivander had not anticipated or understood would gregorowitch know better was he truly more skilled than ollivander did he know secrets of wands that ollivander did not 
 
 this girl is very krum said recalling harry to his surroundings krum was pointing at ginny who had just joined luna she is also a relative of yours 
 
 yeah said harry suddenly irritated and shes seeing someone jealous type big bloke you wouldnt want to cross him 
 
 krum grunted 
 
 vot he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the girls are taken 
 
 and he strode off leaving harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor he wanted to find ron to tell him about gregorovitch but he was dancing with hermione out in the middle of the floor harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched ginny who was now dancing with fred and georges friend lee jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given ron 
 
 he had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd as the evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained fred and george had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of fleurs cousins charlie hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing odo the hero in the corner 
 
 wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of rons who seemed unsure whether or not harry was his son harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table his cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a fez he was vaguely familiar racking his brains harry suddenly realized that this was elphias doge member of the order of the phoenix and the writer of dumbledores obituary 
 
 harry approached him 
 
 may i sit down 
 
 of course of course said doge he had a rather wheezy voice 
 
 harry leaned in 
 
 mr doge im harry potter 
 
 doge gasped 
 
 my dear boy arthur told me you were here disguised i am so glad so honored 
 
 in a flutter of nervous pleasure doge poured harry a goblet of champagne 
 
 i thought of writing to you he whispered after dumbledore the shock and for you i am sure 
 
 doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears 
 
 i saw the obituary you wrote for the daily prophet said harry i didnt realize you knew professor dumbledore so well 
 
 as well as anyone said doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin certainly i knew him longest if you dont count aberforth c and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth 
 
 speaking of the daily prophet i dont know whether you saw mr doge 
 
 oh please call me elphias dear boy 
 
 elphias i dont know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore 
 
 doges face flooded with angry color 
 
 oh yes harry i saw it that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you my have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity 
 
 well in that interview harry went on rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young 
 
 dont believe a word of it said doge at once not a word harry let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore 
 
 harry looked into doges earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated did doge really think it was that easy that harry could simply choose not to believe didnt doge understand harrys need to be sure to know everything 
 
 perhaps doge suspected harrys feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on harry rita skeeter is a dreadful c 
 
 but he was interrupted by a shrill cackle 
 
 rita skeeter oh i love her always read her 
 
 harry and doge looked up to see auntie muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hair a goblet of champagne in her hand shes written a book about dumbledore you know 
 
 hello muriel said doge yes we were just discussing c 
 
 you there give me your chair im a hundred and seven 
 
 another redheaded weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and auntie muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between doge and harry 
 
 hello again barry or whatever your name is she said to harry now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know shes written a biography of dumbledore i cant wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts 
 
 doge looked stiff and solemn at this but auntie muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement she took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus 
 
 sniping said doge turning again 
 
 you would say that elphias cackled auntie muriel i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours 
 
 im sorry you think so said doge more coldly still i assure you i was writing from the heart 
 
 oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister 
 
 muriel exclaimed doge 
 
 a chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through harrys chest 
 
 what do you mean he asked muriel who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill 
 
 thought wrong then didnt you barry said auntie muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened thats why i cant wait to find out what skeeters unearthed dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time 
 
 untrue wheezed doge absolutely untrue 
 
 he never told me his sister as a squib said harry without thinking still cold inside 
 
 and why on earth would he tell you screeched muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon harry 
 
 the reason albus never spoke about ariana began elphias in a voice stiff with emotion is i should have thought quite clear he was so devastated by her death c 
 
 why did nobody ever see her elphias squawked muriel why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house 
 
 what dyou mean locked in the cellar asked harry what is this 
 
 doge looked wretched auntie muriel cackled again and answered harry 
 
 dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying though i heard she pretended otherwise 
 
 she never pretended anything of the sort kendra was a fine woman whispered doge miserably but auntie muriel ignored him 
 
 proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib 
 
 ariana was not a squib wheezed doge 
 
 so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts said auntie muriel she turned back to harry in our day squibs were often hushed up thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist c 
 
 i tell you thats not what happened said doge but auntie muriel steamrollered on still addressing harry 
 
 squibs were usually shipped off to muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally kendra dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a muggle school c 
 
 ariana was delicate said doge desperately her health was always too poor to permit her c 
 
 to permit her to leave the house cackled muriel and yet she was never taken to st mungos and no healer was ever summoned to see her 
 
 really muriel how can you possibly know whether c 
 
 for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there all most suspicious lancelot thought 
 
 doge looked to be on the verge of tears auntie muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne numbly harry thought of how the dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard had dumbledores sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic and had dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented 
 
 now if kendra hadnt died first muriel resumed id have said that it was she who finished off ariana c 
 
 how can you muriel groaned doge a mother kill her own daughter think what youre saying 
 
 if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not shrugged auntie muriel but as i say it doesnt fit because kendra died before ariana c of what nobody ever seemed sure 
 
 yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle said auntie muriel thoughtfully shake your head all you like elphias you were at arianas funeral were you not 
 
 yes i was said doge through trembling lips and a more desperately sad occasion i cannot remember albus was heartbroken 
 
 his heart wasnt the only thing didnt aberforth break albus nose halfway through the service 
 
 if doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now muriel might have stabbed him she cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin 
 
 how do you croaked doge 
 
 my mother was friendly with old bathilda bagshot said auntie muriel happily bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door a brawl the way bathilda told it aberforth shouted that it was all albus fault that ariana was dead and then punched him in the face according to bathilda albus did not even defend himself and thats odd enough in itself albus could have destroyed aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back 
 
 muriel swigged yet more champagne the recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified doge harry did not know what to think what to believe he wanted the truth and yet all doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that ariana had been ill harry could hardly believe that dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story 
 
 and ill tell you something else muriel said hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter all those hints in skeeters interview about an important source close to the dumbledores c goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit 
 
 bathilda would never talk to rita skeeter whispered doge 
 
 bathilda bagshot harry said the author of a history of magic 
 
 the name was printed on the front of one of harrys textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively 
 
 yes said doge clutching at harrys question like a drowning man at a life heir a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albuss 
 
 quite gaga these days ive heard said auntie muriel cheerfully 
 
 if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her said doge and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said 
 
 oh there are ways of bringing back memories and im sure rita skeeter knows them all said auntie muriel but even if bathildas completely cuckoo im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters she knew the dumbledores for years well worth a trip to godrics hollow id have thought 
 
 harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked doge banged him on the back as harry coughed looking at auntie muriel through streaming eyes once he had control of his voice again he asked bathilda bagshot lives in godrics hollow 
 
 oh yes shes been there forever the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor 
 
 the dumbledores lived in godrics hollows 
 
 yes barry thats what i just said said auntie muriel testily 
 
 harry felt drained empty never once in six years had dumbledore told harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in godrics hollow why were lily and james buried close to dumbledores mother and sister had dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past lilys and jamess to do so and he had never once told harry never bothered to say 
 
 and why it was so important harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common he stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him 
 
 i simply cant dance anymore she panted slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot rons gone looking to find more butterbeers its a bit odd ive just seen viktor storming away from lunas father it looked like theyd been arguing c she dropped her voice staring at him harry are you okay 
 
 harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter at that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in then the patronuss mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 the ministry has fallen scrimgeour is dead they are coming 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 beauty of form and beauty of mind 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a sculptor named alfred who having won the 
 large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship went to italy 
 and then came back to his native land he was young at that time 
 indeed he is young still although he is ten years older than he 
 was then on his return he went to visit one of the little towns in 
 the island of zealand the whole town knew who the stranger was and one of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor and all who were of any consequence or who possessed some property were invited it was quite an event and all the town knew of it so that 
 it was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum 
 
 children of the poor and even the poor people 
 themselves stood before the house watching the lighted windows 
 and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a party also 
 there were so many people in the streets there was quite an air of 
 festivity about it and the house was full of it for mr alfred 
 the sculptor was there he talked and told anecdotes and every one 
 listened to him with pleasure not unmingled with awe but none felt 
 so much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer 
 she seemed so far as mr alfred was concerned to be like a piece 
 of fresh that absorbed all he said and asked for 
 more she was very appreciative and incredibly ignorant a kind of 
 female gaspar hauser 
 
 i should like to see rome she said it must be a lovely 
 city or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there 
 now do give me a description of rome how does the city look when you enter in at the gate 
 
 i cannot very well describe it said the sculptor but you 
 enter on a large open space in the centre of which stands an obelisk 
 which is a thousand years old 
 
 an organist exclaimed the lady who had never heard the word 
 obelisk several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing 
 and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his 
 countenance but the smile on his lips faded away for he caught sight 
 of a pair of eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady 
 
 they belonged to her daughter and surely no one who had such a 
 daughter could be silly the mother was like a fountain of 
 questions and the daughter who listened but never spoke might 
 have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain how charming she 
 was she was a study for the sculptor to contemplate but not to 
 converse with for she did not speak or at least very seldom 
 has the pope a great family inquired the lady 
 
 the young man answered considerately as if the question had 
 been a different one no he does not come from a great family 
 
 that is not what i asked persisted the widow i mean has he a 
 wife and children 
 
 the pope is not allowed to marry replied the gentleman 
 i like that was the remark 
 
 she certainly might have asked more sensible questions but if she 
 had not been allowed to say just what she liked would her daughter 
 have been there leaning so gracefully on her shoulder and looking 
 straight before her with a smile that was almost mournful on her 
 face 
 
 mr alfred again spoke of italy and of the glorious colors in 
 italian scenery the purple hills the deep blue of the mediterranean 
 the azure of southern skies whose brightness and glory could only 
 be surpassed in the north by the eyes of a maiden and he 
 said this with a peculiar intonation but she who should have 
 understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it which also 
 was charming 
 
 beautiful italy sighed some of the guests 
 oh to travel there exclaimed others 
 charming charming echoed from every voice 
 i may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery 
 said the naval widow and if i do we will travel i and my 
 daughter and you mr alfred must be our guide we can all three 
 travel together with one or two more of our good friends and she 
 nodded in such a friendly way at the company that each imagined 
 himself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to italy 
 
 yes we must go she continued but not to those parts where 
 there are robbers we will keep to rome in the public roads one is 
 always safe 
 
 the daughter sighed very gently and how much there may be in a 
 sigh or attributed to it the young man attributed a great deal of 
 meaning to this sigh those eyes which had been lit up this 
 evening in honor of him must conceal treasures treasures of heart 
 and mind richer than all the glories of rome and so when he left the 
 party that night he had lost it completely to the young lady the 
 house of the naval widow was the one most constantly visited by mr alfred the sculptor it was soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady though they were the persons who kept up the conversation he came for the sake of the daughter they called her kaela her name was really karen malena and these two names had been contracted into the one name kaela she was really beautiful but some said she was rather dull and slept late of a morning she has been accustomed to that her mother said she is a beauty and they are always easily tired she does sleep rather 
 late but that makes her eyes so clear 
 
 what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes the 
 young man felt the truth of the proverb still waters run deep 
 and his heart had sunk into their depths he often talked of his 
 adventures and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questions 
 as on the first evening they met it was a pleasure to hear alfred 
 describe anything he showed them colored plates of naples and 
 spoke of excursions to mount vesuvius and the eruptions of fire 
 from it the naval widow had never heard of them before 
 good heavens she exclaimed so that is a burning mountain but 
 is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it 
 
 whole cities have been destroyed he replied for instance 
 herculaneum and pompeii 
 
 oh the poor people and you saw all that with your own eyes 
 
 no i did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in 
 those pictures but i will show you a sketch of my own which 
 represents an eruption i once saw 
 
 he placed a pencil sketch on the table and mamma who had been 
 with the appearance of the colored plates threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment what did you see it throw up white fire 
 
 for a moment respect for mamma underwent a 
 sudden shock and lessened considerably but dazzled by the light 
 which surrounded kaela he soon found it quite natural that the old 
 lady should have no eye for color after all it was of very little 
 consequence for mamma had the best of all possessions 
 namely kaela herself 
 
 alfred and kaela were betrothed which was a very natural 
 result and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the little 
 town mama purchased thirty copies of the paper that she might cut 
 out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances the 
 betrothed pair were very happy and the mother was happy too she said it seemed like connecting herself with thorwalsden 
 
 you are a true successor of thorwalsden she said to alfred and 
 it seemed to him as if in this instance mamma had said a clever 
 thing kaela was silent but her eyes shone her lips smiled every 
 movement was graceful in fact she was beautiful that cannot be 
 repeated too often alfred decided to take a bust of kaela as well 
 as of her mother they sat to him accordingly and saw how he 
 moulded and formed the soft clay with his fingers 
 
 i suppose it is only on our account that you perform this 
 work yourself instead of leaving it to your servant to 
 do all that sticking together 
 
 it is really necessary that i should mould the clay myself he 
 replied 
 
 ah yes you are always so polite said mamma with a smile and 
 kaela silently pressed his hand all soiled as it was with the clay 
 then he unfolded to them both the beauties of nature in all her 
 works he pointed out to them how in the scale of creation inanimate 
 matter was inferior to animate nature the plant above the mineral 
 the animal above the plant and man above them all he strove to 
 show them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the outward form and that it was the task to seize upon that beauty of expression and produce it in his works kaela stood silent but nodded in approbation of what he said while made the following confession 
 
 it is difficult to follow you but i go hobbling along after 
 you with my thoughts though what you say makes my head whirl round and round still i contrive to lay hold on some of it 
 
 beauty had a firm hold on alfred it filled his soul 
 and held a mastery over him beauty beamed from every feature glittered in her eyes lurked in the corners of her mouth and 
 pervaded every movement of her agile fingers alfred the sculptor 
 saw this he spoke only to her thought only of her and the two 
 became one and so it may be said she spoke much for he was always talking to her and he and she were one such was the betrothal and then came the wedding with and wedding presents all duly mentioned in the wedding speech had set up bust at the end of the table attired in a it was her fancy that he should be a guest songs were sung and cheers given for it was a gay wedding and they were a handsome pair pygmalion loved his galatea said one of the songs 
 
 ah that is some of your mythologies said 
 next day the youthful pair started for copenhagen where they were 
 to live accompanied them to attend to the coarse 
 work as she always called the domestic arrangements kaela looked 
 like a doll in a house for everything was bright and new 
 and so fine there they sat all three and as for alfred a proverb 
 may describe his position he looked like a swan amongst the geese 
 the magic of form had enchanted him he had looked at the casket 
 without caring to inquire what it contained and that omission often 
 brings the greatest unhappiness into married life the casket may be 
 injured the gilding may fall off and then the purchaser regrets 
 his bargain 
 
 in a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving 
 way with no studs at hand to fall back upon but it is worse still in 
 a large company to be conscious that your wife and are 
 talking nonsense and that you cannot depend upon yourself to 
 produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole 
 affair 
 
 the young married pair often sat together hand in hand he would 
 talk but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same 
 melodious voice the same tones it was a mental relief when 
 sophy one of her friends came to pay them a visit sophy was not 
 pretty she was however quite free from any physical deformity 
 although kaela used to say she was a little crooked but no eye 
 save an intimate acquaintance would have noticed it she was a very 
 sensible girl yet it never occurred to her that she might be a 
 dangerous person in such a house her appearance created a new 
 atmosphere in the house and air was really required they 
 all owned that they felt the want of a change of air and 
 consequently the young couple and their mother travelled to italy 
 
 thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls 
 said and daughter both on their return after a 
 absence 
 
 there is no real pleasure in travelling said mamma to tell 
 the truth very wearisome i beg pardon for saying so i was soon 
 very tired of it although i had my children with me and besides 
 very expensive work travelling very expensive and all those 
 galleries one is expected to see and the quantity of things you are 
 obliged to run after it must be done for very shame you are sure to 
 be asked when you come back if you have seen everything and will most likely be told that omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all i got tired at last of those endless madonnas i began to 
 think i was turning into a madonna myself 
 
 and then the living mamma said kaela 
 
 yes indeed she replied no such a thing as a respectable meat 
 soup their cookery is miserable stuff 
 
 the journey had also tired kaela but she was always fatigued 
 that was the worst of it so they sent for sophy and she was taken 
 into the house to reside with them and her presence there was a great 
 advantage acknowledged that sophy was not only a 
 clever housewife but and accomplished though that 
 could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means she was 
 also a faithful girl she showed that thoroughly 
 while kaela lay sick fading away when the casket is everything 
 the casket should be strong or else all is over and all was over 
 with the casket for kaela died 
 
 she was beautiful said her mother she was quite different 
 from the beauties they call antiques for they are so damaged a 
 beauty ought to be perfect and kaela was a perfect beauty 
 alfred wept and mamma wept and they both wore mourning the 
 black dress suited mamma very well and she wore mourning the longest 
 
 she had also to experience another grief in seeing alfred marry again 
 marry sophy who was nothing at all to look at gone to the very extreme said he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest and he has forgotten his first wife men have no constancy my husband was a very different man but then he died before me 
 
 pygmalion loved his galatea was in the song they sung at my 
 first wedding said alfred i once fell in love with a beautiful 
 statue which awoke to life in my arms but the kindred soul which is 
 a gift from heaven the angel who can feel and sympathize with and 
 elevate us i have not found and won till now you came sophy not in the glory of outward beauty though you are even fairer than is 
 necessary the chief thing still remains you came to teach the 
 sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only an outward form made of a material that decays and that what we should seek to obtain is the ethereal essence of mind and spirit poor kaela our life was but as a meeting by the in yonder world where we shall know each other from a union of mind we shall be but mere acquaintances 
 
 that was not a loving speech said sophy nor spoken like a 
 christian in a future state where there is neither marrying nor 
 giving in marriage but where as you say souls are attracted to each 
 other by sympathy there everything beautiful develops itself and 
 is raised to a higher state of existence her soul will acquire such 
 completeness that it may harmonize with yours even more than mine 
 and you will then once more utter your first rapturous exclamation 
 of your love beautiful most beautiful

 the sculptor was there he talked and told anecdotes and every one 
 listened to him with pleasure not unmingled with awe but none felt 
 so much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer 
 she seemed so far as mr alfred was concerned to be like a piece 
 of fresh that absorbed all he said and asked for 
 more she was very appreciative and incredibly ignorant a kind of 
 female gaspar hauser 
 
 i should like to see rome she said it must be a lovely 
 city or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there 
 now do give me a description of rome how does the city look when you enter in at the gate 
 
 i cannot very well describe it said the sculptor but you 
 enter on a large open space in the centre of which stands an obelisk 
 which is a thousand years old 
 
 an organist exclaimed the lady who had never heard the word 
 obelisk several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing 
 and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his 
 countenance but the smile on his lips faded away for he caught sight 
 of a pair of eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady 
 
 they belonged to her daughter and surely no one who had such a 
 daughter could be silly the mother was like a fountain of 
 questions and the daughter who listened but never spoke might 
 have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain how charming she 
 was she was a study for the sculptor to contemplate but not to 
 converse with for she did not speak or at least very seldom 
 has the pope a great family inquired the lady 
 
 the young man answered considerately as if the question had 
 been a different one no he does not come from a great family 
 
 that is not what i asked persisted the widow i mean has he a 
 wife and children 
 
 the pope is not allowed to marry replied the gentleman 
 i like that was the remark 
 
 she certainly might have asked more sensible questions but if she 
 had not been allowed to say just what she liked would her daughter 
 have been there leaning so gracefully on her shoulder and looking 
 straight before her with a smile that was almost mournful on her 
 face 
 
 mr alfred again spoke of italy and of the glorious colors in 
 italian scenery the purple hills the deep blue of the mediterranean 
 the azure of southern skies whose brightness and glory could only 
 be surpassed in the north by the eyes of a maiden and he 
 said this with a peculiar intonation but she who should have 
 understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it which also 
 was charming 
 
 beautiful italy sighed some of the guests 
 oh to travel there exclaimed others 
 charming charming echoed from every voice 
 i may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery 
 said the naval widow and if i do we will travel i and my 
 daughter and you mr alfred must be our guide we can all three 
 travel together with one or two more of our good friends and she 
 nodded in such a friendly way at the company that each imagined 
 himself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to italy 
 
 yes we must go she continued but not to those parts where 
 there are robbers we will keep to rome in the public roads one is 
 always safe 
 
 the daughter sighed very gently and how much there may be in a 
 sigh or attributed to it the young man attributed a great deal of 
 meaning to this sigh those eyes which had been lit up this 
 evening in honor of him must conceal treasures treasures of heart 
 and mind richer than all the glories of rome and so when he left the 
 party that night he had lost it completely to the young lady the 
 house of the naval widow was the one most constantly visited by mr alfred the sculptor it was soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady though they were the persons who kept up the conversation he came for the sake of the daughter they called her kaela her name was really karen malena and these two names had been contracted into the one name kaela she was really beautiful but some said she was rather dull and slept late of a morning she has been accustomed to that her mother said she is a beauty and they are always easily tired she does sleep rather 
 late but that makes her eyes so clear 
 
 what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes the 
 young man felt the truth of the proverb still waters run deep 
 and his heart had sunk into their depths he often talked of his 
 adventures and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questions 
 as on the first evening they met it was a pleasure to hear alfred 
 describe anything he showed them colored plates of naples and 
 spoke of excursions to mount vesuvius and the eruptions of fire 
 from it the naval widow had never heard of them before 
 good heavens she exclaimed so that is a burning mountain but 
 is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it 
 
 whole cities have been destroyed he replied for instance 
 herculaneum and pompeii 
 
 oh the poor people and you saw all that with your own eyes 
 
 no i did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in 
 those pictures but i will show you a sketch of my own which 
 represents an eruption i once saw 
 
 he placed a pencil sketch on the table and mamma who had been 
 with the appearance of the colored plates threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment what did you see it throw up white fire 
 
 for a moment respect for mamma underwent a 
 sudden shock and lessened considerably but dazzled by the light 
 which surrounded kaela he soon found it quite natural that the old 
 lady should have no eye for color after all it was of very little 
 consequence for mamma had the best of all possessions 
 namely kaela herself 
 
 alfred and kaela were betrothed which was a very natural 
 result and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the little 
 town mama purchased thirty copies of the paper that she might cut 
 out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances the 
 betrothed pair were very happy and the mother was happy too she said it seemed like connecting herself with thorwalsden 
 
 you are a true successor of thorwalsden she said to alfred and 
 it seemed to him as if in this instance mamma had said a clever 
 thing kaela was silent but her eyes shone her lips smiled every 
 movement was graceful in fact she was beautiful that cannot be 
 repeated too often alfred decided to take a bust of kaela as well 
 as of her mother they sat to him accordingly and saw how he 
 moulded and formed the soft clay with his fingers 
 
 i suppose it is only on our account that you perform this 
 work yourself instead of leaving it to your servant to 
 do all that sticking together 
 
 it is really necessary that i should mould the clay myself he 
 replied 
 
 ah yes you are always so polite said mamma with a smile and 
 kaela silently pressed his hand all soiled as it was with the clay 
 then he unfolded to them both the beauties of nature in all her 
 works he pointed out to them how in the scale of creation inanimate 
 matter was inferior to animate nature the plant above the mineral 
 the animal above the plant and man above them all he strove to 
 show them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the outward form and that it was the task to seize upon that beauty of expression and produce it in his works kaela stood silent but nodded in approbation of what he said while made the following confession 
 
 it is difficult to follow you but i go hobbling along after 
 you with my thoughts though what you say makes my head whirl round and round still i contrive to lay hold on some of it 
 
 beauty had a firm hold on alfred it filled his soul 
 and held a mastery over him beauty beamed from every feature glittered in her eyes lurked in the corners of her mouth and 
 pervaded every movement of her agile fingers alfred the sculptor 
 saw this he spoke only to her thought only of her and the two 
 became one and so it may be said she spoke much for he was always talking to her and he and she were one such was the betrothal and then came the wedding with and wedding presents all duly mentioned in the wedding speech had set up bust at the end of the table attired in a it was her fancy that he should be a guest songs were sung and cheers given for it was a gay wedding and they were a handsome pair pygmalion loved his galatea said one of the songs 
 
 ah that is some of your mythologies said 
 next day the youthful pair started for copenhagen where they were 
 to live accompanied them to attend to the coarse 
 work as she always called the domestic arrangements kaela looked 
 like a doll in a house for everything was bright and new 
 and so fine there they sat all three and as for alfred a proverb 
 may describe his position he looked like a swan amongst the geese 
 the magic of form had enchanted him he had looked at the casket 
 without caring to inquire what it contained and that omission often 
 brings the greatest unhappiness into married life the casket may be 
 injured the gilding may fall off and then the purchaser regrets 
 his bargain 
 
 in a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving 
 way with no studs at hand to fall back upon but it is worse still in 
 a large company to be conscious that your wife and are 
 talking nonsense and that you cannot depend upon yourself to 
 produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole 
 affair 
 
 the young married pair often sat together hand in hand he would 
 talk but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same 
 melodious voice the same tones it was a mental relief when 
 sophy one of her friends came to pay them a visit sophy was not 
 pretty she was however quite free from any physical deformity 
 although kaela used to say she was a little crooked but no eye 
 save an intimate acquaintance would have noticed it she was a very 
 sensible girl yet it never occurred to her that she might be a 
 dangerous person in such a house her appearance created a new 
 atmosphere in the house and air was really required they 
 all owned that they felt the want of a change of air and 
 consequently the young couple and their mother travelled to italy 
 
 thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls 
 said and daughter both on their return after a 
 absence 
 
 there is no real pleasure in travelling said mamma to tell 
 the truth very wearisome i beg pardon for saying so i was soon 
 very tired of it although i had my children with me and besides 
 very expensive work travelling very expensive and all those 
 galleries one is expected to see and the quantity of things you are 
 obliged to run after it must be done for very shame you are sure to 
 be asked when you come back if you have seen everything and will most likely be told that omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all i got tired at last of those endless madonnas i began to 
 think i was turning into a madonna myself 
 
 and then the living mamma said kaela 
 
 yes indeed she replied no such a thing as a respectable meat 
 soup their cookery is miserable stuff 
 
 the journey had also tired kaela but she was always fatigued 
 that was the worst of it so they sent for sophy and she was taken 
 into the house to reside with them and her presence there was a great 
 advantage acknowledged that sophy was not only a 
 clever housewife but and accomplished though that 
 could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means she was 
 also a faithful girl she showed that thoroughly 
 while kaela lay sick fading away when the casket is everything 
 the casket should be strong or else all is over and all was over 
 with the casket for kaela died 
 
 she was beautiful said her mother she was quite different 
 from the beauties they call antiques for they are so damaged a 
 beauty ought to be perfect and kaela was a perfect beauty 
 alfred wept and mamma wept and they both wore mourning the 
 black dress suited mamma very well and she wore mourning the longest 
 
 she had also to experience another grief in seeing alfred marry again 
 marry sophy who was nothing at all to look at gone to the very extreme said he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest and he has forgotten his first wife men have no constancy my husband was a very different man but then he died before me 
 
 pygmalion loved his galatea was in the song they sung at my 
 first wedding said alfred i once fell in love with a beautiful 
 statue which awoke to life in my arms but the kindred soul which is 
 a gift from heaven the angel who can feel and sympathize with and 
 elevate us i have not found and won till now you came sophy not in the glory of outward beauty though you are even fairer than is 
 necessary the chief thing still remains you came to teach the 
 sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only an outward form made of a material that decays and that what we should seek to obtain is the ethereal essence of mind and spirit poor kaela our life was but as a meeting by the in yonder world where we shall know each other from a union of mind we shall be but mere acquaintances 
 
 that was not a loving speech said sophy nor spoken like a 
 christian in a future state where there is neither marrying nor 
 giving in marriage but where as you say souls are attracted to each 
 other by sympathy there everything beautiful develops itself and 
 is raised to a higher state of existence her soul will acquire such 
 completeness that it may harmonize with yours even more than mine 
 and you will then once more utter your first rapturous exclamation 
 of your love beautiful most beautiful

 the same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes for they 
 are as men fallen out with the times and think other harms a redemption of their own sufferings they that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and vain glory are ever envious for they cannot want work it being impossible but many in some one of those things should surpass them which was the character of hadrian the emperor that mortally envied poets and painters and artificers in works wherein he had a vein to excel 
 lastly near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised for it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note of others and envy ever redoubled from speech and fame envy was the more vile and malignant towards his brother abel because when his sacrifice was better accepted there was nobody to look on thus much for those that are apt to envy 
 concerning those that are more or less subject to envy first persons of eminent 
 virtue when they are advanced are less envied for their fortune seemeth but due unto them and no man envieth me payment of a debt but rewards and liberality rather 
 
 again envy is ever joined with the comparing of a self and where there is 
 no comparison no envy and therefore kings are not envied but by kings 
 nevertheless it is to be noted that unworthy persons are most envied at their first coming in and afterwards overcome it better whereas contrariwise persons of worth and merit are most envied when their fortune continueth long for by that time though their virtue be the same yet it hath not the same lustre for fresh men grow up that darken it 
 persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising for it seemeth but right 
 done to their birth besides there seemeth not much added to their fortune and envy is as the sunbeams that beat hotter upon a bank or steep rising ground than upon a flat and for the same reason those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per salturn 
 
 those that have joined with their honour great travels cares or perils are less 
 subject to envy for men think that they earn their honours hardly and pity them sometimes and pity ever healeth envy wherefore you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons in their greatness are ever bemoaning themselves what a life they lead chanting a quanta patimur not that they feel it so but only to abate the edge of envy but this is to be understood of business that is laid upon men and not such as they call unto themselves for nothing increaseth envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business and nothing doth extinguish envy more than for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers in their full rights and of their places for by that means there be so many screens between him and envy 
 
 above all those are most subject to envy which cany the greatness of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner being never well but while they are showing how great they are either by outward pomp or by triumphing over all opposition or competition whereas wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and overborne in things that do not much concern them notwithstanding so much is true that the carriage of greatness in a plain and open manner so it be without arrogance and vain glory doth draw less envy than if it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion for in that course a man doth but disavow fortune and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth and doth but teach others to envy him 
 
 lastly to conclude this part as we said in the beginning that the act of envy 
 had somewhat in it of witchcraft so there is no other cure of envy but the cure 
 of witchcraft and that is to remove the lot as they call it and to lay it upon 
 another for which purpose the wiser sort of great persons bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy that would come upon themselves sometimes upon ministers and servants sometimes upon colleagues and associates and the like and for that turn there are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking natures who so they may have power and business will take it at any cost now to speak of public envy there is yet some good in public envy whereas in private there is none for public envy is as an ostracism that eclipseth men when they grow too great and therefore it is a bridle also to great ones to keep them within bounds 
 this envy being in the latin word invidia goeth in the modem languages by the name of discontentment of which we shall speak in handling sedition it is a disease in a stale like to infection for as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound and tainteth it so when envy is gotten once into a state it traduceth even the best actions thereof and turneth them into an ill odour and therefore there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions for that doth argue but a weakness and fear of envy which hurteth so much the more as it is likewise usual in infections which if you fear them you call them upon you 
 this public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers or ministers rather than upon kings and estates themselves but this is a sure rule that if the envy upon the minister be great when the cause of it in him is small or if the envy be general in a manner upon all the ministers of an estate then the envy though hidden is truly upon the estate itself and so much of public envy or discontentment and the difference thereof from private envy which was handled in the first place 
 we will add this in general touching the affection of envy that of all other 
 affections it is the most importune and continual for of other affections mere

 the envious man that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night as it always cometh to pass that envy worketh subtly and in the dark and to the prejudice of good things such as is the wheat

 sentiments my dear scarlett i mean my dear mrs kennedy

 consider a most opportune moment i go all my life waiting to

 philosophy after drinking 
 the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty 
 he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest 
 he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls everything else seemed to him very stupid 
 he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m myriel himself who listened to him 
 on some occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m myriel were to dine with the prefect at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed 
 egad bishop have a discussion 
 it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking 
 we are two augurs i am going to make a confession to you 
 i have a philosophy of my own 
 and you are right replied the bishop 
 as one makes philosophy so one lies on it 
 you are on the bed of purple senator 
 the senator was encouraged and went on 
 let us be good fellows 
 good devils even said the bishop 
 i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis pyrrhon hobbes and m naigeon are no rascals i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges 
 like yourself count interposed the bishop 
 the senator resumed 
 i hate diderot he is an ideologist a declaimer and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for eels prove that god is useless 
 a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux 
 suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world 
 man is the eel then what is the good of the eternal father 
 the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop 
 it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow 
 down with that great all which torments me hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace 
 between you and me and in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity 
 tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars 
 renunciation why 
 sacrifice to what end i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf 
 let us stick to nature then 
 we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy 
 what is the advantage of being at the top if one sees no further than the end of other noses 
 let us live merrily 
 life is all 
 that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere i believe not one single word of it 
 ah sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the fas and the nefas 
 why 
 because i shall have to render an account of my actions 
 when 
 after death 
 what a fine dream after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me have a handful of dust seized by a if you can let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis 
 there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation 
 let us seek the real 
 let us get to the bottom of it 
 let us go into it thoroughly 
 what the deuce let us go to the bottom of it 
 we must scent out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it 
 then it gives you exquisite joys then you grow strong and you laugh 
 i am square on the bottom i am 
 immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead shoes 
 ah what a charming promise trust to it if you like what a fine lot adam has 
 we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star 
 very well 
 we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars and then besides we shall see god 
 ta ta ta 
 what twaddle all these paradises are 
 god is a nonsensical monster 
 i would not say that in the moniteur egad but i may whisper it among friends inter pocula 
 to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow 
 be the dupe of the infinite not such a fool 
 i am a nought 
 i call myself monsieur le comte nought senator 
 did i exist before my birth 
 no shall i exist after death 
 no what am i 
 a little dust collected in an organism what am i to do on this earth 
 the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy 
 whither will suffering lead me 
 to nothingness but i shall have suffered 
 whither will enjoyment lead me to nothingness but i shall have enjoyed myself 
 my choice is made one must eat or be eaten 
 i shall eat 
 it is better to be the tooth than the grass 
 such is my wisdom 
 after which go whither i push thee the is there the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great hole 
 end 
 finis 
 total liquidation this is the death is death believe me i laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject 
 fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for men 
 no our is the night 
 beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness 
 you have been sardanapalus you have been vincent de makes no difference 
 that is the truth 
 then live your life above all things 
 make use of your i while you have it 
 in truth bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i have my philosophers 
 i let myself be taken in with that nonsense 
 of course there must be something for those who are the barefooted beggars and miserable wretches 
 legends chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for them to swallow they gobble it down 
 they spread it on their dry bread he who has nothing else has the good 
 god 
 that is the least he can have 
 i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naigeon for myself 
 the good god is good for the populace 
 the bishop clapped his hands 
 talking he exclaimed 
 what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism 
 not every one who wants it can have it 
 ah when one does have it one is no longer a dupe one does not stupidly allow self to be exiled like cato nor stoned like stephen nor burned alive like jeanne those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without sinecures dignities power whether well or ill acquired lucrative recantations useful treacheries savory capitulations of that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished 
 how agreeable that is i do not say that with reference to you senator 
 nevertheless it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you 
 you great lords have so you say a philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably 
 this philosophy has been extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers 
 but you are princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor

 joe peers down the street after her running between the people in order to keep within sight he follows her into a market as ann wanders along taking her time just enjoying herself she walks past several vendors offering her their goods 
 as ann stops to look at a stall joe has to back off and is instantly targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge melons he shakes his head at him more interested in keeping an eye on ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall then pays the woman vendor for them vendor persists and joe finally buys the melon off him which at once quietens him down so carrying the melon he follows ann down to another street where she stops looking out at the fontana di trevi a magnificent facade ornamented with statues fronted by a pool 
 ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain stopping outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window which surround a mirror she appears disappointed at the way she looks in the mirror and after smiling at the hair of someone who walks past decides to go inside

 a new hope 
 viii 
 
 solo was busily checking readouts from gauges and dials in the hold he would pass a small box across various sensors study the result andcluck with pleasure 
 you can stop worrying about your imperial friends he told luke and never be able to track us now told you lose them 
 kenobi might have nodded briefly in response but he was engaged in explainingsomething to luke 
 everybody thank me at once solo grunted slightly miffed computer calculates our arrival in alderaan orbit at after this little adventure have to forge a new registration 
 he returned to his checking passing in front of a small circular table the topwas covered with small squares lit from beneath while computer monitors were setinto each side tiny figures were projected above the tabletopfrom various squares 
 chewbacca sat hunched over on side of the table his chin resting in massivehands his great eyes glowing and facial whiskers wrinkled upward he gave everysign of being well pleased with himself 
 at least he did until artoo detoo reached up with a stubby clawed limb acrossfrom him and tapped his own computer monitor one of the figures walked abruptlyacross the board to a new square and stopped there 
 an expression of puzzlement then anger crossed the face as he studiedthe new configuration glaring up and over the table he vented a stream of abusivegibberish on the inoffensive machine artoo could only beep in reply but threepiosoon interceded on behalf of his less eloquent companion and began arguing with thehulking anthropoid 
 he executed a fair move screaming about it help you 
 attracted by the commotion solo looked back over his shoulder frowningslightly let him have it your way ahead anyhow not wise to upseta wookie 
 i can sympathize with that opinion sir threepio countered but there isprinciple at stake here there are certain standards any sentient creature must holdto if one compromises them for any reason including intimidation then one isabrogating his right to be called intelligent 
 i hope both remember that solo advised him when chewbacca ispulling the arms off you and your little friend 
 besides that however threepio continued without missing a beat beinggreedy or taking advantage of someone in a weakened position is a clear sign of poorsportsmanship 
 that elicited a beep of outrage from artoo and the two robots were soonengaged in violent electronic argument while chewbacca continued jabbering at eachin turn occasionally waving at them though the translucent pieces waiting patientlyon the board 
 oblivious to the altercation luke stood frozen in the middle of the hold heheld an activated lightsaber in position over his head a low hum came from theancient instrument while luke lunged and parried under ben instructivegaze as solo glanced from time to time at awkward movements his leanfeatures were sprinkled with smugness 
 no luke you cuts should flow not be so choppy kenobi instructed the force is omnipresent it envelops you as it radiates from you ajedi warrior can actually feel the force as a physical thing 
 it is an energy field then luke inquired 
 an energy field and something more kenobi went on almost aura that at once controls and obeys it is a nothingness that can accomplishmiracles he looked thoughtful for a moment 
 no one not even the jedi scientists were able to truly define the no one ever will sometimes there is as much magic as science in theexplanations of the force yet what is a magician but a practicing theorist try again 
 the old man was hefting a silvery globe about the size of a fist it wascovered with fine antennae some as delicate as those of a moth he flipped ittoward luke and watched as it halted a couple of meters away from the face 
 luke readied himself as the ball circled him slowly turning to face it as itassumed a new position abruptly it executed a lunge only to freezeabout a meter away luke failed to succumb to the feint and the balls soon backedoff 
 moving slowly to one side in an effort to get around the fore sensors lukedrew the saber back preparatory to striking as he did so the ball darted in behindhim a thin pencil of red light jumped from one of the antennae to the back thigh knocking him to the deck even as he was bringing his saber late 
 rubbing at his tingling sleeping leg luke tried to ignore the burst of accusinglaughter from solo religions and archaic weapons are no substitutefor a good blaster at your side the pilot sneered 
 you believe in the force asked luke struggling back to his feet thenumbing effect of the beam wore off quickly 
 been from one end of this galaxy to the other the pilot boasted and a lot of strange things to many to believe there be something like too many to think that there could be some such controlling determine my some energy field he gestured towardkenobi i follow him so blindly if i were you a clever old of simple tricks and mischief he might be using you for his own ends 
 kenobi only smiled gently then turned back to face luke i suggest you try itagain luke he said soothingly you must try to divorce your actions fromconscious control try not to focus on anything concrete visually or mentally youmust let your mind drift drift only then can you use the force you have to enter astate in which you act on what you sense not on what you think beforehand youmust cease cogitation relax stop thinkinglet yourself driftfreefree 
 the old voice had dropped to a mesmerizing buzz as he finished thechrome bulb darted at luke dazed by hypnotic tone luke see itcharge doubtful he saw much of anything with clarity but as the ball whirled with amazing speed the saber arcing up and out in a peculiar red beam that the globe emitted was neatly deflected to one side it hummingstopped and the ball bounced to the deck all animation gone 
 blinking as if coming awake from a short nap luke stared in absoluteastonishment at the inert remote 
 you see you can do it kenobi told him one can teach only so you must learn to admit the force when you want it so that you can learn tocontrol it consciously 
 moving to one side kenobi took a large helmet from behind a locker and walkedover to luke placing the helmet over his head effectively eliminated the 
 i see luke muttered turning around and forcing kenobi to step back outof range of the dangerously wavering saber how can i fight 
 with the force old ben explained you really see the seeker whenyou parried its beam try to let that sensation flow within you again 
 i do it luke moaned get hit again 
 not if you let yourself trust you kenobi insisted none too convincingly forluke this is the only way to be certain replying wholly on the force 
 noticing that the corellian had turned to watch kenobi hesitated did luke no good to have the pilot laugh every time a mistake wasmade but coddling the boy would do him no good either and there was no time forit anyway throw him in and hope he floats ben instructed himself firmly 
 bending over the chrome globe he touched a control at its side then he tossedit straight up it arched toward luke braking in midfall the ball toward the deck luke swung the saber at it while it was acommendable try it nearly fast enough once again the little antenna time the crimson needle hit luke square on the seat of his pants though an incapacitating below it felt like one and luke let out a yelp of pain as hespun trying to strike his invisible tormentor 
 relax old ben urged him be free trying to use your eyes andears stop predicting and use the rest of your mind 
 suddenly the youth stopped waving slightly the seeker was still behind direction again it made another dive and fired 
 simultaneously the lightsaber jerked around as accurate as it was awkward in itsmotion to deflect the bolt this time the ball fall motionless to the it backed up three meters and remained there hovering 
 aware that the drone of the seeker remote no longer assaulted his ears a cautiousluke peeked out from under the helmet sweat and exhaustion competed for spaceon his face 
 did i 
 i told you you could kenobi informed him with pleasure once you start totrust your inner self be no stopping you i told you there was much of yourfather in you 
 call it luck snorted solo as he concluded his examination of the readouts 
 in my experience there is no such thing as luck my young highlyfavorable adjustments of multiple factors to incline events in favor 
 call it what you like the corellian sniffed indifferently but good against amechanical remote is one thing good against a living menace is another 
 as he was speaking a small telltale light on the far side of the hold had begunflashing chewbacca noticed it and called out to him 
 solo glanced at the board then informed his passengers coming up onalderaan be slowing down shortly and going back under lightspeed comeon chewie 
 rising from the game table the wookie followed his partner toward the watched them depart but his mind on their imminent arrival at was burning with something else something that seemed to grow and mature at theback of his brain as he dwelt on it 
 you know he murmured i did feel something i could almost see theoutlines of the remote he gestured at the hovering device behind him 
 voice when he replied was solemn luke taken the first stepinto a larger universe 
 dozens of humming buzzing instruments lent the cockpit the air of abusy hive solo and chewbacca had their attention locked on the most vital of thoseinstruments 
 steadystand by chewie solo adjusted several manual to go sublightreadycut us in chewie 
 the wookie turned something on the console before him at the same timesolo pulled back on a comparatively large lever abruptly the long streaks starlight slowed to hyphen shapes then finally to familiar bolts offire a gauge on the console registered zero 
 gigantic chunks of glowing stone appeared out of the nothingness barelyshunted aside by the deflectors the strain caused the millennium falcon tobegin shuddering violently 
 what the a thoroughly startled solo muttered next to him chewbaccaoffered no comment of his own as he flipped off several controls and activated the fact that the cautious solo always emerged from supralight travel with hisdeflectors in case any of many unfriendly folks might be waiting for saved the freighter from instant destruction 
 luke fought to keep his balance as he made his way into the cockpit on 
 back in normal space solo informed him but come out in themiddle of the worst asteroid storm ever seen not on any of our peered hard at several indicators according to the galactic atlas our position iscorrect only one thing is missing alderaan 
 missing crazy 
 i argue with you the corellian replied grimly but look for gestured out the port the coordinates and nothingwrong with the we ought to be standing out one planetary diameter fromthe surface the glow should be filling the cockpit nothing outthere nothing but debris he paused judging from the level of wild energyoutside and the amount of solid waste guess that been blown 
 destroyed luke whispered overwhelmed at the specter raised by such anunimaginable disaster 
 the empire a voice declared firmly ben kenobi had come in behind his attention was held by the emptiness ahead as well as the import behind it 
 no solo was shaking his head slowly in his own way even he was stunnedby the enormity of what the old man was suggesting that a human agency had beenresponsible for the annihilation of an entire population of a planet itself 
 nothe entire imperial fleet have done this it would take athousand ships massing a lot more firepower than has ever existed 
 i wonder if we should get out of here luke was murmuring trying to seearound the rims of the port if by some chance it was the empire 
 i know happened here an angry solo cursed but tell you onething the empire 
 muffled alarms began humming loudly as a synchronous light flashed on thecontrol console solo bent to the appropriate instrumentation 
 another ship he announced judge the type yet 
 a survivor who might know what happened luke venturedhopefully 
 ben next words shattered more than that hope an imperialfighter 
 chewbacca suddenly gave an angry bark a huge flower of destructionblossomed outside the port battering the freighter violently a tiny raced past the cockpit port 
 it followed us luke shouted 
 from tatooine it have objected a disbelieving solo not inhyperspace 
 kenobi was studying the configuration the tracking screen displayed right han the tie fighter 
 but where did it come from the corellian wanted to know there are noimperial bases near here it have been a tie job 
 you saw it pass 
 i know it looked like a tie what about a base 
 leaving in a big hurry luke noted studying the tracker no matterwhere going if it identifies us in big trouble 
 not if i can help it solo declared chewie jam its transmission lay in apursuit course 
 it would be best to let it go kenobi ventured thoughtfully already toofar out of range 
 not for long 
 several minutes followed during which the cockpit was filled with a tensesilence al eyes were on the tracking screen and viewport 
 at first the imperial fighter tried a complex evasive course to no avail thesurprisingly maneuverable freighter hung tight on its tail continuing to make up thedistance between them seeing that he shape his pursuers the fighter pilothad obviously opened up his tiny engine all the way 
 ahead one of the multitudes of stars was becoming steadily brighter lukefrowned they were moving fast but not nearly fast enough for any heavenly objectto brighten so rapidly something here make sense 
 impossible for a fighter that small to be this deep in space on its own soloobserved 
 it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something lukehypothesized 
 comment was gleeful well he be around long enough to tellanyone about us be on top of him in a minute or two 
 the star ahead continued to brighten its glow evidently coming from within itassumed a circular outline 
 heading for that small moon luke murmured 
 the empire must have an outpost there solo admitted although accordingto the atlas alderaan had no moons he shrugged it off galactic topographywas never one of my best subjects only interested in worlds and moons withcustomers on them but i think i can get him before he gets there almost inrange 
 they drew steadily nearer gradually craters and mountains on the moonbecame visible yet there was something extremely odd about them the craterswere far too regular in outline the mountains far too vertical canyons and valleyimpossibly straight and regularized nothing as capricious as volcanic action hadformed those features 
 no moon kenobi breathed softly a space station 
 but too big to be a space station solo objected the size of it it 
 i have a very strange feeling about this was comment 
 abruptly the usually calm kenobi was shouting turn the ship around out of here 
 yes i think right old man full reverse chewie 
 the wookie started adjusting controls and the freighter seemed to slow arcingaround in a broad curve the tiny fighter leaped instantly toward the monstrousstation until it was swallowed up by its overpowering bulk 
 chewbacca chattered something at solo as the ship shook and strained againstunseen forces 
 lock in auxiliary power solo ordered 
 gauges began to whine in protest and by ones and twos every instrument on thecontrol console sequentially went berserk try as he might solo keep thesurface of the gargantuan station from looming steadily larger it becamethe heavens 
 luke stared wildly at secondary installations as big as mountains dish antennaelarger than all of mos eisley why are we still moving toward it 
 too late kenobi whispered softly a glance at solo confirmed his concern 
 caught in a tractor on i ever saw dragging us pilot muttered 
 you mean nothing you can do luke asked feeling unbelievablyhelpless 
 solo studied the overloaded sensor readouts and shook his head not againstthis kind of power on full power myself kid and not shifting out of coursea fraction of a degree no use going to have to shut down or meltour engines but not going to suck me up like so much dust without a fight 
 he started to vacate the chair but was restrained by an aged yet powerfulhand on his shoulder an expression of concern was on the old suggestion of something somewhat less funereal 
 if a fight you cannot my boy there are always alternatives tofighting 
 the true size of the battle station became apparent as the freighter was pulledcloser and closer running around the equator was an artificial cluster ofmetal mountains docking ports stretching beckoning fingers nearly two kilometersabove the surface 
 now only a miniscule speck against the gray bulk of the station the millenniumfalcon was sucked toward one of those steel pseudopods and finally swallowed by lake of metal closed off the entryway and the freighter vanished as if it had neverexisted 
 vader stared at the motley array of stars displayed on the mapwhile tarkin and admiral motti conferred nearby interestingly the first use of themost powerful destructive machine ever constructed had seemingly had no influenceat all on that map which in itself represented only a tiny fraction of this section of galaxy 
 it would take a microbreakdown of a portion of this map to reveal a slightreduction in spatial mass caused by the disappearance of alderaan alderaan withits many cities farms factories and traitors vader reminded himself 
 despite his advances and intricate technological methods of annihilation theactions of mankind remained unnoticeable to an uncaring unimaginably vast grandest plans ever came to pass all that would change 
 he was well aware that despite all their intelligence and drive the vastness andwonder were lost on the two men who continued to chatter monkeylike behind and motti were talented and ambitious but they saw things only on the scale ofhuman pettiness it was a pity vader thought that they did not possess the scope tomatch their abilities 
 still neither man was a dark lord as such little more could be expected ofthem these two were useful now and dangerous but someday they like have to be swept aside for now he could not afford to ignore them andwhile he would have preferred the company of equals he had to admit reluctantly thatat this point he had no equals 
 nonetheless he turned to them and insinuated himself into their defense systems on alderaan despite the protestations to the as strong as any in the empire i should conclude that our demonstration wasas impressive as it was thorough 
 tarkin turned to him nodding the senate is being informed of our action atthis very moment soon we will be able to announce the extermination of thealliance itself as soon as we have dealt with their main military base now thattheir main source of munitions alderaan has been eliminated the rest of thosesystems with secessionist inclinations will fall in line quickly enough see 
 tarkin turned as an imperial officer entered the chamber yes what is 
 the unlucky officer wore the expression of the mouse chosen to bell the the advance scouts have reached and circumnavigated dantooine theyhave found the remains of a rebel base which they estimate has been deserted forsome time years possibly they are proceeding with an extensive survey of theremainder of the system 
 tarkin turned apoplectic his face darkening to a fine pomegranate fury shelied she lied to us 
 no one could see but it seemed that vader must have smiled behind his we are even in the first exchange of truths i told you she would neverbetray the she thought her confession could somehow destroy us inthe process 
 terminate her immediately the governor was barely able to form words 
 calm yourself tarkin vader advised him you would throw away our onlylink to the real rebel base so casually she can still be of value to us 
 fagh you just said it yourself vader get nothing more out of her that hidden fortress if i have to destroy every star system in this sector 
 a quiet yet demanding beep interrupted him yes what is it he inquiredirritably 
 a voice reported over an unseen speaker sirs captured a smallfreighter that was entering the remains of alderaan a standard check indicates thatits markings apparently match that of the ship which blasted its way out of thequarantine at mos eisley tatooine system and went hyper before the imperialblockade craft there could close on it 
 tarkin looked puzzled mos eisley tatooine what is this thisall about vader 
 it means tarkin that the last of our unresolved difficulties is about to beeliminated someone apparently received the missing data tapes learned whotranscribed them and was trying to return them to her we may be able to facilitatetheir meeting with the senator 
 tarkin started to say something hesitated then nodded in understanding howconvenient i leave this matter in your hands vader 
 the dark lord bowed slightly a gesture which tarkin acknowledged withperfunctory salute then he spun and strode from the room leaving motti lookingfrom man to man in confusion 
 the freighter sat listlessly in the docking hangar of the huge bay thirty armedimperial troopers stood before the lowered man ramp leading into the ship theysnapped to attention when vader and a commander approached vader halted at thebase of the ramp studying the vessel as an officer and several soldiers came forward 
 there was no reply to our repeated signals sir so we activated the ramp fromoutside made no contact with anyone aboard either by communicator or inperson the officer reported 
 send your men in vader ordered 
 turning the officer relayed to command to a noncom who barked orders anumber of the heavily armored soldiers made their way up the ramp and entered theouter hold they advanced with appreciable caution 
 inside two men covered a third as he advanced moving in groups of three inthis fashion they rapidly spread through the ship corridors rang hollowly feet and doors slid aside willingly as they were activated 
 empty the sergeant in charge finally declared in surprise check thecockpit 
 several troopers made their way forward and slid the portal aside only todiscover the chairs as vacant as the rest of the freighter the controls weredeactivated and all systems shut down only a single light on the console winked onand off fitfully the sergeant moved forward recognized the source of the light andactivated the appropriate controls a printout appeared on a nearby screen hestudied it intently then turned to convey the information to his superior who waswaiting by the main hatch 
 that worthy listened carefully before he turned and called down to thecommander and vader there is no one aboard the ship is completely according to the log her crew abandoned ship immediately after set her on automatics for alderaan 
 possibly a decoy the commander ventured aloud then they should still beon tatooine 
 possibly vader admitted reluctantly 
 several of the escape pods have been jettisoned the officer went on 
 did you find any droids on board vader called 
 no if there were any they must have abandoned the ship alongwith the organic crew 
 vader hesitated before replying when he did so uncertainty was evident in hisvoice this feel right send a fully equipped scanning team on board iwant every centimeter of that ship checked out see to it as soon as that he whirled and stalked from the hangar pursued by the infuriating feelingthat he was overlooking something of vital importance 
 the rest of the assembled soldiers were dismissed by the officer on board thefreighter a last long figure left off examining the space beneath the cockpit consolesand ran to join his comrades he was anxious to be off this ghost ship and back inthe comfortable surroundings of the barracks his heavy footsteps echoed throughthe once more empty freighter 
 below the muffled sounds of the officer giving final orders faded leaving theinterior in complete quiet the quivering of a portion of the floor was the onlymovement on board 
 abruptly the quivering became a sharp upheaval two metal panels poppedupward followed by a pair of tousled heads han solo and luke looked aroundquickly then managed to relax a little when it became clear that the ship was as emptyas it sounded 
 lucky built these compartments luke commented 
 solo was not as cheerily confident where did you think i kept the main hold i admit i never expected to smuggle myself in started violently at a sudden sound but it was only another of the panels shiftingaside 
 this is ridiculous it going to work even if i could take off and getpast the closed jabbed a thumb never get past that tractorbeam 
 another panel opened revealing the face of an elderly imp you leave that tome 
 i was afraid say something like that muttered solo a damnfool old man 
 kenobi grinned at him what does that say of the man who allows himself tobe hired by a fool 
 solo muttered something under his breath as they pulled themselves clear of thecompartments chewbacca doing so with a good deal of grunting and twisting 
 two technicians had arrived at the base of the ramp they reported to the twobored soldiers guarding it 
 the all yours one of the troopers told them if the scanners pick upanything report it immediately 
 the men nodded then strained to lug their heavy equipment up the ramp assoon as they disappeared inside a loud crash was heard both guards whirled thenheard a voice call hey down there could you give us a hand with this 
 one trooper looked at his companion who shrugged they both started up theramp muttering at the inefficiency of mere technicians a second crashing soundreverberated but now there was no one left to hear it 
 but the absence of the two troopers was noticed soon thereafter a gantryofficer passing the window of a small command office near the freighter entranceglanced out frowning when he saw no sign of the guards concerned but notalarmed he moved to a comlink and spoke into it as he continued to stare at the ship 
 thx why you at your post thx do you copy 
 the speaker gave back only static 
 thx why you reply the officer was beginning to panic whenan armored figure descended the ramp and waved toward him pointing to theportion of his helmet covering his right ear the figure tapped it to indicate thecomlink inside working 
 shaking his head in disgust the gantry officer gave his busy aide an annoyedlook as he made for the door take over here got another bad going to see what i can do he activated the door took a step forward as it stumbled backward in a state of shock 
 filling the door completely was a towering hairy form chewbacca leanedinward and with a howl flattened the benumbed officer with oneswipe of a fist 
 the aide was already on his feet and reaching for his sidearm when a narrowenergy beam passed completely through him piercing his heart solo flipped up thefaceplate of his trooper helmet then slid it back into place as he followed the wookieinto the room kenobi and the droids squeezed in behind him with luke also cladin the armor of a luckless imperial soldier bringing up the rear 
 luke was looking around nervously as he shut the door behind them betweenhis howling and your blasting everything in sight a wonder the entire know here 
 bring em on solo demanded unreasonably enthused by their success so prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking in a hurry to die luke snapped but not all this sneakingaround has kept us alive 
 the corellian gave luke a sour eye but said nothing 
 they watched as kenobi operated an incredibly complex computer console withthe ease and confidence of one long accustomed to handling intricate machinery ascreen lit up promptly with a map of sections of the battle station the old manleaned forward scrutinizing the display carefully 
 meanwhile threepio and artoo had been going over an equally complicatedcontrol panel nearby artoo suddenly froze and began whistling wildly at somethinghe had found solo and luke their momentary disagreement over tactics over to where the robots were standing chewbacca busied himself hangingthe gentry officer up by his toes 
 plug him in kenobi suggested looking over from his place before the largerreadout he should be able to draw information from the entire station see if he can find out where the tractor beam power unit is located 
 why not just disconnect the beam from here sir luke wanted to know 
 it was solo who replied derisively what and have them lock it right back on usbefore we can get a length outside the docking bay 
 luke looked crestfallen oh i thought of that 
 we have to break the tractor at its power source in order to execute a cleanescape luke old ben chided gently as artoo punched a claw arm into the opencomputer socket he had discovered immediately a galaxy of lights came to life onthe panel in front of him and the room was filled with the hum of machinery workingat high speed 
 several minutes passed while the little droid sucked up information like a metalsponge then the hum slowed and he turned to beep something back at them 
 found it sir threepio announced excitedly 
 the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactors at seven locations most ofthe pertinent data is restricted but try to pull the critical information through tothe monitor 
 kenobi turned his attention from the larger screen to a small readout near began to race across it too fast for luke to see but apparently kenobi somehowmade something of the schematic blur i think any way you boys canhelp with this he told them i must go alone 
 that suits me fine said solo readily already done more than ibargained for on this trip but i think putting that tractor beam out of to take more than your magic old man 
 luke put off so easily i want to go with you 
 be impatient young luke this requires skills you yet and wait for my signal they must be delivered to the rebel forces or manymore worlds will meet the same fate as alderaan trust in the force 
 with a last look at the flow of information on the monitor kenobi adjusted thelightsaber at his waist stepping to the door he slid it aside looked once left onceright and disappeared down a long glowing hallway 
 as soon as he was gone chewbacca growled and solo nodded said it chewie he turned to luke you dig up that old fossil 
 ben a great man luke protested loftily 
 great at getting us into trouble solo snorted general my not going to get us out of here 
 you got any better ideas luke shot back challengingly 
 anything would be better than just waiting here for them to come and pick usup if we 
 a hysterical whistling and hooting came from the computer console lukehurried over to artoo detoo the little droid was all but hopping about on stubbylegs 
 what now luke asked threepio 
 the taller robot looked puzzled himself afraid i understand he says i found her and keeps repeating here here 
 who who has he found 
 artoo turned a flat blinking face toward luke and whistled frantically 
 princess leia the announced after listening carefully senator seem to be one and the same i believe she may be the person in the message hewas carrying 
 that portrait of indescribable beauty coalesced in mindagain the princess here 
 attracted by the commotion solo wandered over princess goingon 
 where where is she luke demanded breathlessly ignoring solocompletely 
 artoo whistled on while threepio translated level five detention block aa according to the information she is scheduled for slow termination 
 no got to do something 
 what are you three blabbering about an exasperated solo demanded 
 the one who programmed the message into artoo detoo luke explainedhurriedly the one we were trying to deliver to alderaan got to help her 
 now just a minute solo cautioned him this is going awful fast for get any funny ideas when i said i have any better ideas i meant old man said to wait here i like it but not going off on some crazymaze through this place 
 but ben know she was here luke half pleaded half argued surethat if he knew he would have changed his plans anxiety turned to if we could just figure a way to get into that detention block 
 solo shook his head and stepped back not going into anyimperial detention blocks 
 if we do something going to execute her a minute ago you saidyou just want to sit here and wait to be captured now all you want to do isstay which is it han 
 the corellian looked confused marching into a not what i had in mind likely to end up there rush it 
 but going to execute her 
 better her than me 
 your sense of chivalry han 
 solo considered near as i can recall i traded it for a chrysopaz andthree bottles of good brandy about five years ago on commenor 
 seen her luke persisted desperately beautiful 
 life 
 a rich and powerful senator luke pressed hoping an appeal to instincts might be more effective if we could save her the reward could besubstantial 
 uhrich then solo looked disdainful wait a minutereward fromwhom from the government on alderaan he made a sweeping gesture towardthe hangar and by implication the space where alderaan had once orbited 
 luke thought furiously if being held here and is scheduled to beexecuted that means she must be dangerous in some way to whoever destroyedalderaan to whoever had this station built you can bet it had something to do withthe empire instituting a reign of full repression 
 tell you pay for her rescue and for the information she holds thesenate the rebel alliance and every concern that did business with alderaan shecould be the sole surviving heir of the wealth of the entire system thereward could be more than you can imagine 
 i knowi can imagine quite a bit he glanced at chewbacca whogrunted a terse reply solo shrugged back at the big wookie all right giveit a try but better be right about that reward your plan kid 
 luke was momentarily taken aback al his energies up till now had beenconcentrated on persuading solo and chewbacca to aid in a rescue attempt thataccomplished luke became aware he had no idea how to proceed he had grownused to old ben and solo giving directions now the next move was up to him 
 his eyes were caught by several metal circlets dangling from the belt of give me those binders and tell chewbacca to come over there 
 solo handed luke the thin but quite unbreakable cuffs and relayed the request tochewbacca the wookie lumbered over and stood waiting next to luke 
 now going to put these on you luke began starting to move behind thewookie with the cuffs and 
 chewbacca made a sound low in his throat and luke jumped in spite of he began again han is going to put these on you and he sheepishlyhanded the binders to solo uncomfortably aware of the enormous eyes on him 
 solo sounded amused as he moved forward worry chewie i think iknow what he has in mind 
 the cuffs barely fit around the thick wrists despite his seemingconfidence in the plan the wookie wore a worried frightened look as the restraintswere activated 
 luke sir luke looked over at threepio pardon me for asking but should artoo and i do if someone discovers us here in your absence 
 hope they have blasters solo replied 
 tone indicated he find the answer humorous that veryreassuring 
 solo and luke were too engrossed in their coming expedition to pay muchattention to the worried robot they adjusted their helmets then with chewbaccawearing a downcast expression they started off along corridor where benkenobi had disappeared

 a new hope 
 viii 
 
 solo was busily checking readouts from gauges and dials in the hold he would pass a small box across various sensors study the result andcluck with pleasure 
 you can stop worrying about your imperial friends he told luke and never be able to track us now told you lose them 
 kenobi might have nodded briefly in response but he was engaged in explainingsomething to luke 
 everybody thank me at once solo grunted slightly miffed computer calculates our arrival in alderaan orbit at after this little adventure have to forge a new registration 
 he returned to his checking passing in front of a small circular table the topwas covered with small squares lit from beneath while computer monitors were setinto each side tiny figures were projected above the tabletopfrom various squares 
 chewbacca sat hunched over on side of the table his chin resting in massivehands his great eyes glowing and facial whiskers wrinkled upward he gave everysign of being well pleased with himself 
 at least he did until artoo detoo reached up with a stubby clawed limb acrossfrom him and tapped his own computer monitor one of the figures walked abruptlyacross the board to a new square and stopped there 
 an expression of puzzlement then anger crossed the face as he studiedthe new configuration glaring up and over the table he vented a stream of abusivegibberish on the inoffensive machine artoo could only beep in reply but threepiosoon interceded on behalf of his less eloquent companion and began arguing with thehulking anthropoid 
 he executed a fair move screaming about it help you 
 attracted by the commotion solo looked back over his shoulder frowningslightly let him have it your way ahead anyhow not wise to upseta wookie 
 i can sympathize with that opinion sir threepio countered but there isprinciple at stake here there are certain standards any sentient creature must holdto if one compromises them for any reason including intimidation then one isabrogating his right to be called intelligent 
 i hope both remember that solo advised him when chewbacca ispulling the arms off you and your little friend 
 besides that however threepio continued without missing a beat beinggreedy or taking advantage of someone in a weakened position is a clear sign of poorsportsmanship 
 that elicited a beep of outrage from artoo and the two robots were soonengaged in violent electronic argument while chewbacca continued jabbering at eachin turn occasionally waving at them though the translucent pieces waiting patientlyon the board 
 oblivious to the altercation luke stood frozen in the middle of the hold heheld an activated lightsaber in position over his head a low hum came from theancient instrument while luke lunged and parried under ben instructivegaze as solo glanced from time to time at awkward movements his leanfeatures were sprinkled with smugness 
 no luke you cuts should flow not be so choppy kenobi instructed the force is omnipresent it envelops you as it radiates from you ajedi warrior can actually feel the force as a physical thing 
 it is an energy field then luke inquired 
 an energy field and something more kenobi went on almost aura that at once controls and obeys it is a nothingness that can accomplishmiracles he looked thoughtful for a moment 
 no one not even the jedi scientists were able to truly define the no one ever will sometimes there is as much magic as science in theexplanations of the force yet what is a magician but a practicing theorist try again 
 the old man was hefting a silvery globe about the size of a fist it wascovered with fine antennae some as delicate as those of a moth he flipped ittoward luke and watched as it halted a couple of meters away from the face 
 luke readied himself as the ball circled him slowly turning to face it as itassumed a new position abruptly it executed a lunge only to freezeabout a meter away luke failed to succumb to the feint and the balls soon backedoff 
 moving slowly to one side in an effort to get around the fore sensors lukedrew the saber back preparatory to striking as he did so the ball darted in behindhim a thin pencil of red light jumped from one of the antennae to the back thigh knocking him to the deck even as he was bringing his saber late 
 rubbing at his tingling sleeping leg luke tried to ignore the burst of accusinglaughter from solo religions and archaic weapons are no substitutefor a good blaster at your side the pilot sneered 
 you believe in the force asked luke struggling back to his feet thenumbing effect of the beam wore off quickly 
 been from one end of this galaxy to the other the pilot boasted and a lot of strange things to many to believe there be something like too many to think that there could be some such controlling determine my some energy field he gestured towardkenobi i follow him so blindly if i were you a clever old of simple tricks and mischief he might be using you for his own ends 
 kenobi only smiled gently then turned back to face luke i suggest you try itagain luke he said soothingly you must try to divorce your actions fromconscious control try not to focus on anything concrete visually or mentally youmust let your mind drift drift only then can you use the force you have to enter astate in which you act on what you sense not on what you think beforehand youmust cease cogitation relax stop thinkinglet yourself driftfreefree 
 the old voice had dropped to a mesmerizing buzz as he finished thechrome bulb darted at luke dazed by hypnotic tone luke see itcharge doubtful he saw much of anything with clarity but as the ball whirled with amazing speed the saber arcing up and out in a peculiar red beam that the globe emitted was neatly deflected to one side it hummingstopped and the ball bounced to the deck all animation gone 
 blinking as if coming awake from a short nap luke stared in absoluteastonishment at the inert remote 
 you see you can do it kenobi told him one can teach only so you must learn to admit the force when you want it so that you can learn tocontrol it consciously 
 moving to one side kenobi took a large helmet from behind a locker and walkedover to luke placing the helmet over his head effectively eliminated the 
 i see luke muttered turning around and forcing kenobi to step back outof range of the dangerously wavering saber how can i fight 
 with the force old ben explained you really see the seeker whenyou parried its beam try to let that sensation flow within you again 
 i do it luke moaned get hit again 
 not if you let yourself trust you kenobi insisted none too convincingly forluke this is the only way to be certain replying wholly on the force 
 noticing that the corellian had turned to watch kenobi hesitated did luke no good to have the pilot laugh every time a mistake wasmade but coddling the boy would do him no good either and there was no time forit anyway throw him in and hope he floats ben instructed himself firmly 
 bending over the chrome globe he touched a control at its side then he tossedit straight up it arched toward luke braking in midfall the ball toward the deck luke swung the saber at it while it was acommendable try it nearly fast enough once again the little antenna time the crimson needle hit luke square on the seat of his pants though an incapacitating below it felt like one and luke let out a yelp of pain as hespun trying to strike his invisible tormentor 
 relax old ben urged him be free trying to use your eyes andears stop predicting and use the rest of your mind 
 suddenly the youth stopped waving slightly the seeker was still behind direction again it made another dive and fired 
 simultaneously the lightsaber jerked around as accurate as it was awkward in itsmotion to deflect the bolt this time the ball fall motionless to the it backed up three meters and remained there hovering 
 aware that the drone of the seeker remote no longer assaulted his ears a cautiousluke peeked out from under the helmet sweat and exhaustion competed for spaceon his face 
 did i 
 i told you you could kenobi informed him with pleasure once you start totrust your inner self be no stopping you i told you there was much of yourfather in you 
 call it luck snorted solo as he concluded his examination of the readouts 
 in my experience there is no such thing as luck my young highlyfavorable adjustments of multiple factors to incline events in favor 
 call it what you like the corellian sniffed indifferently but good against amechanical remote is one thing good against a living menace is another 
 as he was speaking a small telltale light on the far side of the hold had begunflashing chewbacca noticed it and called out to him 
 solo glanced at the board then informed his passengers coming up onalderaan be slowing down shortly and going back under lightspeed comeon chewie 
 rising from the game table the wookie followed his partner toward the watched them depart but his mind on their imminent arrival at was burning with something else something that seemed to grow and mature at theback of his brain as he dwelt on it 
 you know he murmured i did feel something i could almost see theoutlines of the remote he gestured at the hovering device behind him 
 voice when he replied was solemn luke taken the first stepinto a larger universe 
 dozens of humming buzzing instruments lent the cockpit the air of abusy hive solo and chewbacca had their attention locked on the most vital of thoseinstruments 
 steadystand by chewie solo adjusted several manual to go sublightreadycut us in chewie 
 the wookie turned something on the console before him at the same timesolo pulled back on a comparatively large lever abruptly the long streaks starlight slowed to hyphen shapes then finally to familiar bolts offire a gauge on the console registered zero 
 gigantic chunks of glowing stone appeared out of the nothingness barelyshunted aside by the deflectors the strain caused the millennium falcon tobegin shuddering violently 
 what the a thoroughly startled solo muttered next to him chewbaccaoffered no comment of his own as he flipped off several controls and activated the fact that the cautious solo always emerged from supralight travel with hisdeflectors in case any of many unfriendly folks might be waiting for saved the freighter from instant destruction 
 luke fought to keep his balance as he made his way into the cockpit on 
 back in normal space solo informed him but come out in themiddle of the worst asteroid storm ever seen not on any of our peered hard at several indicators according to the galactic atlas our position iscorrect only one thing is missing alderaan 
 missing crazy 
 i argue with you the corellian replied grimly but look for gestured out the port the coordinates and nothingwrong with the we ought to be standing out one planetary diameter fromthe surface the glow should be filling the cockpit nothing outthere nothing but debris he paused judging from the level of wild energyoutside and the amount of solid waste guess that been blown 
 destroyed luke whispered overwhelmed at the specter raised by such anunimaginable disaster 
 the empire a voice declared firmly ben kenobi had come in behind his attention was held by the emptiness ahead as well as the import behind it 
 no solo was shaking his head slowly in his own way even he was stunnedby the enormity of what the old man was suggesting that a human agency had beenresponsible for the annihilation of an entire population of a planet itself 
 nothe entire imperial fleet have done this it would take athousand ships massing a lot more firepower than has ever existed 
 i wonder if we should get out of here luke was murmuring trying to seearound the rims of the port if by some chance it was the empire 
 i know happened here an angry solo cursed but tell you onething the empire 
 muffled alarms began humming loudly as a synchronous light flashed on thecontrol console solo bent to the appropriate instrumentation 
 another ship he announced judge the type yet 
 a survivor who might know what happened luke venturedhopefully 
 ben next words shattered more than that hope an imperialfighter 
 chewbacca suddenly gave an angry bark a huge flower of destructionblossomed outside the port battering the freighter violently a tiny raced past the cockpit port 
 it followed us luke shouted 
 from tatooine it have objected a disbelieving solo not inhyperspace 
 kenobi was studying the configuration the tracking screen displayed right han the tie fighter 
 but where did it come from the corellian wanted to know there are noimperial bases near here it have been a tie job 
 you saw it pass 
 i know it looked like a tie what about a base 
 leaving in a big hurry luke noted studying the tracker no matterwhere going if it identifies us in big trouble 
 not if i can help it solo declared chewie jam its transmission lay in apursuit course 
 it would be best to let it go kenobi ventured thoughtfully already toofar out of range 
 not for long 
 several minutes followed during which the cockpit was filled with a tensesilence al eyes were on the tracking screen and viewport 
 at first the imperial fighter tried a complex evasive course to no avail thesurprisingly maneuverable freighter hung tight on its tail continuing to make up thedistance between them seeing that he shape his pursuers the fighter pilothad obviously opened up his tiny engine all the way 
 ahead one of the multitudes of stars was becoming steadily brighter lukefrowned they were moving fast but not nearly fast enough for any heavenly objectto brighten so rapidly something here make sense 
 impossible for a fighter that small to be this deep in space on its own soloobserved 
 it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something lukehypothesized 
 comment was gleeful well he be around long enough to tellanyone about us be on top of him in a minute or two 
 the star ahead continued to brighten its glow evidently coming from within itassumed a circular outline 
 heading for that small moon luke murmured 
 the empire must have an outpost there solo admitted although accordingto the atlas alderaan had no moons he shrugged it off galactic topographywas never one of my best subjects only interested in worlds and moons withcustomers on them but i think i can get him before he gets there almost inrange 
 they drew steadily nearer gradually craters and mountains on the moonbecame visible yet there was something extremely odd about them the craterswere far too regular in outline the mountains far too vertical canyons and valleyimpossibly straight and regularized nothing as capricious as volcanic action hadformed those features 
 no moon kenobi breathed softly a space station 
 but too big to be a space station solo objected the size of it it 
 i have a very strange feeling about this was comment 
 abruptly the usually calm kenobi was shouting turn the ship around out of here 
 yes i think right old man full reverse chewie 
 the wookie started adjusting controls and the freighter seemed to slow arcingaround in a broad curve the tiny fighter leaped instantly toward the monstrousstation until it was swallowed up by its overpowering bulk 
 chewbacca chattered something at solo as the ship shook and strained againstunseen forces 
 lock in auxiliary power solo ordered 
 gauges began to whine in protest and by ones and twos every instrument on thecontrol console sequentially went berserk try as he might solo keep thesurface of the gargantuan station from looming steadily larger it becamethe heavens 
 luke stared wildly at secondary installations as big as mountains dish antennaelarger than all of mos eisley why are we still moving toward it 
 too late kenobi whispered softly a glance at solo confirmed his concern 
 caught in a tractor on i ever saw dragging us pilot muttered 
 you mean nothing you can do luke asked feeling unbelievablyhelpless 
 solo studied the overloaded sensor readouts and shook his head not againstthis kind of power on full power myself kid and not shifting out of coursea fraction of a degree no use going to have to shut down or meltour engines but not going to suck me up like so much dust without a fight 
 he started to vacate the chair but was restrained by an aged yet powerfulhand on his shoulder an expression of concern was on the old suggestion of something somewhat less funereal 
 if a fight you cannot my boy there are always alternatives tofighting 
 the true size of the battle station became apparent as the freighter was pulledcloser and closer running around the equator was an artificial cluster ofmetal mountains docking ports stretching beckoning fingers nearly two kilometersabove the surface 
 now only a miniscule speck against the gray bulk of the station the millenniumfalcon was sucked toward one of those steel pseudopods and finally swallowed by lake of metal closed off the entryway and the freighter vanished as if it had neverexisted 
 vader stared at the motley array of stars displayed on the mapwhile tarkin and admiral motti conferred nearby interestingly the first use of themost powerful destructive machine ever constructed had seemingly had no influenceat all on that map which in itself represented only a tiny fraction of this section of galaxy 
 it would take a microbreakdown of a portion of this map to reveal a slightreduction in spatial mass caused by the disappearance of alderaan alderaan withits many cities farms factories and traitors vader reminded himself 
 despite his advances and intricate technological methods of annihilation theactions of mankind remained unnoticeable to an uncaring unimaginably vast grandest plans ever came to pass all that would change 
 he was well aware that despite all their intelligence and drive the vastness andwonder were lost on the two men who continued to chatter monkeylike behind and motti were talented and ambitious but they saw things only on the scale ofhuman pettiness it was a pity vader thought that they did not possess the scope tomatch their abilities 
 still neither man was a dark lord as such little more could be expected ofthem these two were useful now and dangerous but someday they like have to be swept aside for now he could not afford to ignore them andwhile he would have preferred the company of equals he had to admit reluctantly thatat this point he had no equals 
 nonetheless he turned to them and insinuated himself into their defense systems on alderaan despite the protestations to the as strong as any in the empire i should conclude that our demonstration wasas impressive as it was thorough 
 tarkin turned to him nodding the senate is being informed of our action atthis very moment soon we will be able to announce the extermination of thealliance itself as soon as we have dealt with their main military base now thattheir main source of munitions alderaan has been eliminated the rest of thosesystems with secessionist inclinations will fall in line quickly enough see 
 tarkin turned as an imperial officer entered the chamber yes what is 
 the unlucky officer wore the expression of the mouse chosen to bell the the advance scouts have reached and circumnavigated dantooine theyhave found the remains of a rebel base which they estimate has been deserted forsome time years possibly they are proceeding with an extensive survey of theremainder of the system 
 tarkin turned apoplectic his face darkening to a fine pomegranate fury shelied she lied to us 
 no one could see but it seemed that vader must have smiled behind his we are even in the first exchange of truths i told you she would neverbetray the she thought her confession could somehow destroy us inthe process 
 terminate her immediately the governor was barely able to form words 
 calm yourself tarkin vader advised him you would throw away our onlylink to the real rebel base so casually she can still be of value to us 
 fagh you just said it yourself vader get nothing more out of her that hidden fortress if i have to destroy every star system in this sector 
 a quiet yet demanding beep interrupted him yes what is it he inquiredirritably 
 a voice reported over an unseen speaker sirs captured a smallfreighter that was entering the remains of alderaan a standard check indicates thatits markings apparently match that of the ship which blasted its way out of thequarantine at mos eisley tatooine system and went hyper before the imperialblockade craft there could close on it 
 tarkin looked puzzled mos eisley tatooine what is this thisall about vader 
 it means tarkin that the last of our unresolved difficulties is about to beeliminated someone apparently received the missing data tapes learned whotranscribed them and was trying to return them to her we may be able to facilitatetheir meeting with the senator 
 tarkin started to say something hesitated then nodded in understanding howconvenient i leave this matter in your hands vader 
 the dark lord bowed slightly a gesture which tarkin acknowledged withperfunctory salute then he spun and strode from the room leaving motti lookingfrom man to man in confusion 
 the freighter sat listlessly in the docking hangar of the huge bay thirty armedimperial troopers stood before the lowered man ramp leading into the ship theysnapped to attention when vader and a commander approached vader halted at thebase of the ramp studying the vessel as an officer and several soldiers came forward 
 there was no reply to our repeated signals sir so we activated the ramp fromoutside made no contact with anyone aboard either by communicator or inperson the officer reported 
 send your men in vader ordered 
 turning the officer relayed to command to a noncom who barked orders anumber of the heavily armored soldiers made their way up the ramp and entered theouter hold they advanced with appreciable caution 
 inside two men covered a third as he advanced moving in groups of three inthis fashion they rapidly spread through the ship corridors rang hollowly feet and doors slid aside willingly as they were activated 
 empty the sergeant in charge finally declared in surprise check thecockpit 
 several troopers made their way forward and slid the portal aside only todiscover the chairs as vacant as the rest of the freighter the controls weredeactivated and all systems shut down only a single light on the console winked onand off fitfully the sergeant moved forward recognized the source of the light andactivated the appropriate controls a printout appeared on a nearby screen hestudied it intently then turned to convey the information to his superior who waswaiting by the main hatch 
 that worthy listened carefully before he turned and called down to thecommander and vader there is no one aboard the ship is completely according to the log her crew abandoned ship immediately after set her on automatics for alderaan 
 possibly a decoy the commander ventured aloud then they should still beon tatooine 
 possibly vader admitted reluctantly 
 several of the escape pods have been jettisoned the officer went on 
 did you find any droids on board vader called 
 no if there were any they must have abandoned the ship alongwith the organic crew 
 vader hesitated before replying when he did so uncertainty was evident in hisvoice this feel right send a fully equipped scanning team on board iwant every centimeter of that ship checked out see to it as soon as that he whirled and stalked from the hangar pursued by the infuriating feelingthat he was overlooking something of vital importance 
 the rest of the assembled soldiers were dismissed by the officer on board thefreighter a last long figure left off examining the space beneath the cockpit consolesand ran to join his comrades he was anxious to be off this ghost ship and back inthe comfortable surroundings of the barracks his heavy footsteps echoed throughthe once more empty freighter 
 below the muffled sounds of the officer giving final orders faded leaving theinterior in complete quiet the quivering of a portion of the floor was the onlymovement on board 
 abruptly the quivering became a sharp upheaval two metal panels poppedupward followed by a pair of tousled heads han solo and luke looked aroundquickly then managed to relax a little when it became clear that the ship was as emptyas it sounded 
 lucky built these compartments luke commented 
 solo was not as cheerily confident where did you think i kept the main hold i admit i never expected to smuggle myself in started violently at a sudden sound but it was only another of the panels shiftingaside 
 this is ridiculous it going to work even if i could take off and getpast the closed jabbed a thumb never get past that tractorbeam 
 another panel opened revealing the face of an elderly imp you leave that tome 
 i was afraid say something like that muttered solo a damnfool old man 
 kenobi grinned at him what does that say of the man who allows himself tobe hired by a fool 
 solo muttered something under his breath as they pulled themselves clear of thecompartments chewbacca doing so with a good deal of grunting and twisting 
 two technicians had arrived at the base of the ramp they reported to the twobored soldiers guarding it 
 the all yours one of the troopers told them if the scanners pick upanything report it immediately 
 the men nodded then strained to lug their heavy equipment up the ramp assoon as they disappeared inside a loud crash was heard both guards whirled thenheard a voice call hey down there could you give us a hand with this 
 one trooper looked at his companion who shrugged they both started up theramp muttering at the inefficiency of mere technicians a second crashing soundreverberated but now there was no one left to hear it 
 but the absence of the two troopers was noticed soon thereafter a gantryofficer passing the window of a small command office near the freighter entranceglanced out frowning when he saw no sign of the guards concerned but notalarmed he moved to a comlink and spoke into it as he continued to stare at the ship 
 thx why you at your post thx do you copy 
 the speaker gave back only static 
 thx why you reply the officer was beginning to panic whenan armored figure descended the ramp and waved toward him pointing to theportion of his helmet covering his right ear the figure tapped it to indicate thecomlink inside working 
 shaking his head in disgust the gantry officer gave his busy aide an annoyedlook as he made for the door take over here got another bad going to see what i can do he activated the door took a step forward as it stumbled backward in a state of shock 
 filling the door completely was a towering hairy form chewbacca leanedinward and with a howl flattened the benumbed officer with oneswipe of a fist 
 the aide was already on his feet and reaching for his sidearm when a narrowenergy beam passed completely through him piercing his heart solo flipped up thefaceplate of his trooper helmet then slid it back into place as he followed the wookieinto the room kenobi and the droids squeezed in behind him with luke also cladin the armor of a luckless imperial soldier bringing up the rear 
 luke was looking around nervously as he shut the door behind them betweenhis howling and your blasting everything in sight a wonder the entire know here 
 bring em on solo demanded unreasonably enthused by their success so prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking in a hurry to die luke snapped but not all this sneakingaround has kept us alive 
 the corellian gave luke a sour eye but said nothing 
 they watched as kenobi operated an incredibly complex computer console withthe ease and confidence of one long accustomed to handling intricate machinery ascreen lit up promptly with a map of sections of the battle station the old manleaned forward scrutinizing the display carefully 
 meanwhile threepio and artoo had been going over an equally complicatedcontrol panel nearby artoo suddenly froze and began whistling wildly at somethinghe had found solo and luke their momentary disagreement over tactics over to where the robots were standing chewbacca busied himself hangingthe gentry officer up by his toes 
 plug him in kenobi suggested looking over from his place before the largerreadout he should be able to draw information from the entire station see if he can find out where the tractor beam power unit is located 
 why not just disconnect the beam from here sir luke wanted to know 
 it was solo who replied derisively what and have them lock it right back on usbefore we can get a length outside the docking bay 
 luke looked crestfallen oh i thought of that 
 we have to break the tractor at its power source in order to execute a cleanescape luke old ben chided gently as artoo punched a claw arm into the opencomputer socket he had discovered immediately a galaxy of lights came to life onthe panel in front of him and the room was filled with the hum of machinery workingat high speed 
 several minutes passed while the little droid sucked up information like a metalsponge then the hum slowed and he turned to beep something back at them 
 found it sir threepio announced excitedly 
 the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactors at seven locations most ofthe pertinent data is restricted but try to pull the critical information through tothe monitor 
 kenobi turned his attention from the larger screen to a small readout near began to race across it too fast for luke to see but apparently kenobi somehowmade something of the schematic blur i think any way you boys canhelp with this he told them i must go alone 
 that suits me fine said solo readily already done more than ibargained for on this trip but i think putting that tractor beam out of to take more than your magic old man 
 luke put off so easily i want to go with you 
 be impatient young luke this requires skills you yet and wait for my signal they must be delivered to the rebel forces or manymore worlds will meet the same fate as alderaan trust in the force 
 with a last look at the flow of information on the monitor kenobi adjusted thelightsaber at his waist stepping to the door he slid it aside looked once left onceright and disappeared down a long glowing hallway 
 as soon as he was gone chewbacca growled and solo nodded said it chewie he turned to luke you dig up that old fossil 
 ben a great man luke protested loftily 
 great at getting us into trouble solo snorted general my not going to get us out of here 
 you got any better ideas luke shot back challengingly 
 anything would be better than just waiting here for them to come and pick usup if we 
 a hysterical whistling and hooting came from the computer console lukehurried over to artoo detoo the little droid was all but hopping about on stubbylegs 
 what now luke asked threepio 
 the taller robot looked puzzled himself afraid i understand he says i found her and keeps repeating here here 
 who who has he found 
 artoo turned a flat blinking face toward luke and whistled frantically 
 princess leia the announced after listening carefully senator seem to be one and the same i believe she may be the person in the message hewas carrying 
 that portrait of indescribable beauty coalesced in mindagain the princess here 
 attracted by the commotion solo wandered over princess goingon 
 where where is she luke demanded breathlessly ignoring solocompletely 
 artoo whistled on while threepio translated level five detention block aa according to the information she is scheduled for slow termination 
 no got to do something 
 what are you three blabbering about an exasperated solo demanded 
 the one who programmed the message into artoo detoo luke explainedhurriedly the one we were trying to deliver to alderaan got to help her 
 now just a minute solo cautioned him this is going awful fast for get any funny ideas when i said i have any better ideas i meant old man said to wait here i like it but not going off on some crazymaze through this place 
 but ben know she was here luke half pleaded half argued surethat if he knew he would have changed his plans anxiety turned to if we could just figure a way to get into that detention block 
 solo shook his head and stepped back not going into anyimperial detention blocks 
 if we do something going to execute her a minute ago you saidyou just want to sit here and wait to be captured now all you want to do isstay which is it han 
 the corellian looked confused marching into a not what i had in mind likely to end up there rush it 
 but going to execute her 
 better her than me 
 your sense of chivalry han 
 solo considered near as i can recall i traded it for a chrysopaz andthree bottles of good brandy about five years ago on commenor 
 seen her luke persisted desperately beautiful 
 life 
 a rich and powerful senator luke pressed hoping an appeal to instincts might be more effective if we could save her the reward could besubstantial 
 uhrich then solo looked disdainful wait a minutereward fromwhom from the government on alderaan he made a sweeping gesture towardthe hangar and by implication the space where alderaan had once orbited 
 luke thought furiously if being held here and is scheduled to beexecuted that means she must be dangerous in some way to whoever destroyedalderaan to whoever had this station built you can bet it had something to do withthe empire instituting a reign of full repression 
 tell you pay for her rescue and for the information she holds thesenate the rebel alliance and every concern that did business with alderaan shecould be the sole surviving heir of the wealth of the entire system thereward could be more than you can imagine 
 i knowi can imagine quite a bit he glanced at chewbacca whogrunted a terse reply solo shrugged back at the big wookie all right giveit a try but better be right about that reward your plan kid 
 luke was momentarily taken aback al his energies up till now had beenconcentrated on persuading solo and chewbacca to aid in a rescue attempt thataccomplished luke became aware he had no idea how to proceed he had grownused to old ben and solo giving directions now the next move was up to him 
 his eyes were caught by several metal circlets dangling from the belt of give me those binders and tell chewbacca to come over there 
 solo handed luke the thin but quite unbreakable cuffs and relayed the request tochewbacca the wookie lumbered over and stood waiting next to luke 
 now going to put these on you luke began starting to move behind thewookie with the cuffs and 
 chewbacca made a sound low in his throat and luke jumped in spite of he began again han is going to put these on you and he sheepishlyhanded the binders to solo uncomfortably aware of the enormous eyes on him 
 solo sounded amused as he moved forward worry chewie i think iknow what he has in mind 
 the cuffs barely fit around the thick wrists despite his seemingconfidence in the plan the wookie wore a worried frightened look as the restraintswere activated 
 luke sir luke looked over at threepio pardon me for asking but should artoo and i do if someone discovers us here in your absence 
 hope they have blasters solo replied 
 tone indicated he find the answer humorous that veryreassuring 
 solo and luke were too engrossed in their coming expedition to pay muchattention to the worried robot they adjusted their helmets then with chewbaccawearing a downcast expression they started off along corridor where benkenobi had disappeared
